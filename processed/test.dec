Forget it.
The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser.  My sister.  I can't date until she does.
Looks like things worked out tonight, huh?
I was?
Me.  This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.
Thank God!  If I had to hear one more story about your coiffure...
Nowhere... Hi, Daddy.
After that, I swore I'd never do anything just because "everyone else" was doing it.  And I haven't since. Except for Bogey's party, and my stunning gastro-intestinal display --
Yeah.  A couple.  We're outnumbered by the cows, though.
He always have that shit-eating grin?
Unlikely, but even so, she still can't go out with you.  So what's the point?
No, I ' m not.
Yeah -- we'll see.
Don't make me do it, man
She's partial to Joey, not me
What do you think?
Yeah, whatever.  I want you to go out with her.
I can't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend.  And that's the catch. She doesn't want a boyfriend.
Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.
What?  We took bathes together when we were kids.
I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.
Listen to you!  You sound like Betty, all pissed off because Archie is taking Veronica.
You -- covered in my vomit.
"I'm getting trashed, man." Isn't that what you're supposed to do at a party?
Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to sleep
Leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced.
Dorsey.
I thought you were above all that
No, you weren't
Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties.
C'mon.  It's not that bad
How?
It gets worse -- you still have your freshman yearbook?
Just smack her now.
Hi.
Right.
Kat a fan, too?
Yeah...
With the teeth of your zipper?
What's to discuss?
Make anyone cry today?
If they agree to follow me, yes.
Did He not choose a carpenter's son to reveal Himself to the world?
I haven't given you much of a life.
Thank God...
You don't usually ask.
Bartolome and Giacomo Colon.
He asks when he can come to visit you.  He left his address.
You did the same to your God!
Esdras is a Jew.
I'll try to remember that, Marchena...
Thirty seven, Your Majesty... And you?
And what do you think Mendez?
Well, I surely know what a quadrant is!  But I've never seen it used at night before.
Come over here.
Immediately.
And who would you think of, for such a task?
I'm not your lawyer until I see the money.
No, he is here.  Shit...
What's your cut?  How much?
Officers, there's your killer, do your duty, arrest him!
Alright.  That's a justifiable homicide.
I'm sorry.
I'm glad I met you.
I'll get my clothes.
Daphne, I...
Oh yeah...?  Alright.
Yeah.  He finished awhile ago.
What's the kid gonna say - sorry? Meanwhile I'm not here anymore. Like last week - we were at the morgue and this guy was all chopped up - spleen here - liver there - his heart in a pan. Six hours ago this guy was walkin' his dog or buyin' a quart of milk.  Who knows?  But some kid's robbed him for $3 or some shit and shot him and now you can't tell if he's a piece of beef or a human being and I'm thinkin' that's me. Sooner or later.  That's me.
C'mere.  You wanna go to homicide school?  Here - make yourself useful.
We don't have her I.D. yet, but one of your girls was killed last night at the King Edward Hotel.
Do you have any Czech girls working for you?
Daphne.  Another guy came in asking me about her, too.
Describe him.
He had a videocamera?  Where is she? Quickly!
Or Czechoslovakia.  The Slavs have been fighting the Germans and the Russians for a thousand years.  These are very intense people and they take things personally.
Mind if I ride along with you?
Something back home?
Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.
I kill someone famous.
We don't know that yet.  It's much too early.  There's a lot to be done.
We don't know.  When I have more I'll let you know.
Alright?
Alright.
Oh, I'm sorry.  Did I embarrass you, sweetheart?  Oh...
That's good.
Okay.
You're worried for my safety.  I'm touched.
If he doesn't lower his gun I'll fucking kill her.
That's confidential.  Could you put the money on the dresser?
Look.  Do we have a problem here? There's no reason to have a problem. I'm gonna make you feel real good.  You wanna Czech girl? After I'm done with you, you won't miss her.  Now why don't you pay me?
I have five-hundred dollars.
Two weeks.
I want to document my trip to America.
Why?  Why do I always have to speak to you in Czech?
Smell like chemicals...for smoking drugs.
Oleg, get in bathroom, stay there and shut up!
The video of Milos and Tamina - I told you to erase it.
And the whore's murder?  You didn't erase that either, did you?  Don't lie, I won't be angry.
Why not?
Be quiet.  Watch.
Yes.  Before we hand in the next video - I put titles on it and my credit is going to read - Directed by Oleg Razgul.
No, I don't get that!
We started over, you can too.
What do you mean you know?  He told you he was gonna propose to me?
Okay.  You're a Czech national and you're a Russian national.  How do you know one another?
And while they're burning up, they're still goin' down on each other?  You got to hand it to them.
Could you put out the cigar?  Part of the job is picking up scents.
Maybe you can be his stand-in.
The clerk?
Yes?
Well, what do you think we ought to do about it?
But not completely inconceivable?
Well, I hope there's nothing wrong with the assembly on those. Other- wise we're out of business.
Yes.
Yes, I know that. But I can assure you that they were about to fail.
And don't you worry about it.
The antenna has to be replaced.
Look, Dave your've probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me.
Thank you.
Yes, well, whatever it is, they're certainly not fooling around. This is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week.
Oh, that's such a delightful age.
Please, it really doesn't matter.
Yes, it's coming along very well.
Are you quite sure?
How can you tell it was deliberately buried?
Roger.
Roger.
Excuse me, baby, but if i don't get some action tonight, I'm gonna bust.  You interested?
You just quit bein' a priest or somethin'?
No, baby, nothin' like that. Look, there's a place across the street. We can go right over there...
Hey, no, I'm tryin' to be nice. Buy yourself something pretty. I'd do it, but I got to go.  I got this cop waitin' for me...
I used to go with him...I don't know where the hell he is.  I haven't seen him for two weeks. And I don't think I will.  He owes me money...
Would you guys...
You're gonna help us take him.
You got a girl... shit... the generosityof women never ceases to amaze me.
What gang you talkin' about, Jack?
Your pal nuts enough to take a shot at me?
Thank you.
Speakin' of moans my Stomach is startin' to growl.
Bullshit ... I ain't moving  till I get something to eat. You've been treating me like shit ever since I came out here.  If you don't like it, you can take me back to the penitentiary and kiss my hungry black ass good-bye.  And I want some food some place nice.. Some good people, nice music...
She's got the same complaint as half the Goddamn population.  She can't get the job she's trained for and it pisses her off... Anyway, what the fuck do you care?
Why?  Anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably can't get it up anyway.
Shit.
Musta got some primo bondsman.
I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it 'cause it works-...
Hello. And goodbye.
I've got to play it rough with them. If they know anything, I'm gonna know it.
There's nothin' to talk about.
Yeah?
How did they get away?
The Indian.  I was about 30 yards away.
Uhh ... Wong, Henry Wong.  He was in on the same job.
Nothing.
Positive self-image problem all over again ... You are who you decide you are unless you're the type that lets assholes decide for you.
Look, Jack, if you make everything your personal responsibility, you'll turn into a bad cop.  It's not a practical way to function...
I didn't get burned, two cops did. Listen, I'll tell you about personnel responsibility.  I like to get the job done right.  And if I don't get my job done right... I'm for shit.
Elaine, look, I'm in the middle of sone stuff right now... I'm not gonna have time to come by. I don't know when I can get there.
Jack, wait...
Hot?  Hey, they're not even room temperature.
You want that Indian to snap her neck?
Don't give me this, we were partners.
It's loaded... I got some shells in here.
Personally, they are of no interest to me, I'd rather sell weapons..but I have a customer... so tell me...
Follow me.. Life, which you so nobly serve, comes from destruction. Look at this empty glass.
That's me.  But I don't know who she is... where did you find her?
I know. I was there when she arrived.
It means, "Never without my permission".
We have to save the world.
Trying to save your ass so you can save the world.
And you don't know how they open, is that what you are saying?
One more reason to shoot first eh?
Time is of no importance, Mr. President. Only life is important.
Yes..thank God..
Absolutely sure There's the triple suns on her gloves!
I... I don't know! We hardly know each other... it takes time!
Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman I loved her ... I never saw her again.
Oh, yeah, I forgot.You still prefer your cat to the real thing.
You forgetting who sat next to you for a thousand missions. I know how you drive.
So, just how big was this fare?
...Leeloo.
Ma. If I'd won, I'd know about it. Someone would have notified me.
They've been blaring out your name on the radio for the last hour, blockhead!
You little sleaze bag!
We got to find the leader. Mangalores don't fight without a leader.
Oh god!
Yes! But "love" isn't the operative word here, PEACE is!
Learning language.
You know women normally change five times more than men.
It's difficult.
The wind blows... the fire burns...
Uh..
You gotta push the little yellow button...
It's not that easy..we've never encountered anything like it before..you see normal human beings have 40 DNA memo groums..which is more than enough for any species to perpetuate itself..This one has 200,000.
It's an honor to receive you. Mr. President.
How much time is left?
Gentlemen?
I'm about to, Mr. President.
"..in which all the history of the Universe resides ..all the strength..all the hope..Protect us from Evil.."
Amen..
To fame.. salud..
Right away, Sir. I'll send you a new one to the hotel.
How's our deal coming along?
You're not using the same guy who tried to fix it?
I was in hell.  If I called you... if I heard your voice... it would have been so easy for me to quit. I couldn't do that.
She's all I've got.  She's the only witness.
You know where I can get it?  I have a lot of money to spend.
There ain't no such thing as snuff. Why don't you fuck off?
Look, he's got nothing to do with this... let him go...
Can you guess what I'm going to say next?
This doctor and wife, they're nice people, but they don't want to get too involved.  They're not trying to have the parents come looking for the girl either. You and I both know sometimes, not often, but sometimes there's real reasons why a kid'll run. Molestation, whatever.  Besides that, the girl's probably eighteen, so she's legal.
Well, that's all I can do.  Sorry.
It's good what you're doing.
Yeah, who's this?
How much did he pay you?
Maybe there's something wrong with the scumbag customers coming into your place, ever think of that?
Fuck you.
Catchy title.  What are you really reading?  Hard to believe that book's got any parts worth highlighting.
Well, whatever there is, whoever's dealing, however it's done, I want to know.  I want a good look, so if you've got that kind of connection, great.  If not, speak now.
Well, there's the thing; you're not gonna know anything about what I'm doing, but you can make some money.
Here's my number if you need it...  When can you start?
Interesting theory.
There's two kinds of specialty product; legal and illegal.  Foot fetish, shit films, watersports, bondage, spanking, fisting, she- males, hemaphrodites... it's beyond hardcore, but legal.  This is the kind of hardcore where one guy's going to look at it and throw up, another guy looks at it and falls in love.  Now, with some of the S+M and bondage films, they straddle the line.  How are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not?  Step over that line, you're into kiddie porn.  Rape films, but there aren't many.  I've never seen one.
I don't mean any offense... but what are you doing mixed up in all this?
Nothing illegal, it's always borderline.  Like if some freak wants to see a transvestite in a full rubber immersion suit getting an enema from a...
Well, I'm in New York now.  What do you say to flying out and giving me a hand?
There was nothing he could do.  My husband left everything to me.  I prevented anyone from seeing the contents.  I felt these were my husband's private things.  I didn't... I didn't realize...
This is a movie showing a girl being murdered.  She's sitting on a bed, and a man rapes her... and he begins to cut her with a knife...  I only watched what I could.
I told you I can't, not yet.
I know what I'm asking.  Your compensation will be appropriate to the risk.  You'll need cash to buy information, and I'll provide it.  I feel responsible, Mr. Welles.  You saw what he did to her.
To the penny.  Exactly one million dollars in cash.
I've been ordered into bed.  The doctor says I've gotten the flu, or some other wretched ailment.
I hope it's nothing serious.
You probably expect me to be wearing a trench coat and a hat.  Drinking whiskey, chasing women and getting beaten up by guys with broken noses. Want to know what it's really like? It's sitting in a car and staring at a hotel window for three days straight, pissing in a plastic bottle, pardon me, because some guy thinks his wife's cheating on him. Glamorous, huh?  And the guy who hired you, he has a hair-lip, dandruff and crooked teeth, and you could have told him the minute you laid eyes on him his wife's cheating, and you don't blame her.
What was she running from?
It got to be too much for him.
No.
You should be.
I have to tell you something.  It won't be easy for you to hear.  It's about your daughter... Mary Anne...  When I... when I was there with you, her diary, in your attic, in silverware.  If you read it, you'll know what I'm telling you is true...
Someone... some men, they took your daughter and they drugged her, and they took her to a motel room... they did terrible things to her...
No...
Those are her belongings.
No, sir, he is not.
He's an imbecile.  I tried to warn my daughter, but what can you do?
What?
Never say can't.  Just do what I do.
I gotta get to the library before it closes.  Killer physics test.
Rick stayed later after school with Kristen.  She wasn't feeling very well.
Alright, I think I see salvation...
So?
What?
Oh God!  He killed them!
I though Freddy was just an old town story.
You don't get it, he's after me...
Don't worry, honey
How did you know that?
Been having bad dreams.
Who said I...wait, what?
My friend, with the funny hand.
He's inside you, where he hides.
Now.
Yeah, before they revoke his diploma.
He must've wandered up from the children's ward.  I just wondered what was wrong with him.
I think Krueger's trying to do something to it.
That's why it's my fault Dan's dead.
I'm going to see what else I can find out about Mr. Fred Krueger
Empty plot.  Memorial stone.  Vacant. They never did put her under.  Cool, huh?
I don't believe this... All that gore you paint in the comics and you're squeamish?
Nah.  It's getting too cold for me, and my wonderful mother will kill me if I screw up my hair.  She's got some model agency guy coming to dinner tomorrow night.
I'm not finished - I loved Greta.  A lot. And if maybe, just maybe, someone or some thing killed her, I'd like to hear about it!
Not in two days.  Look:  Do you think I <u>wanted</u> to come?  If it didn't mean so much to Dad - proving his depth-explorer - it's the last thing I'd want!
Your 'out.'  This came for you. 
Dead?  Matter of fact, he's much better. He's left the hospital.
Perhaps.  But the idea of willingly going to <u>school</u> to spend my <u>life</u> at a Paleozoic pastime that should have disappeared with the thunder-lizards - I'm referring to War - <u>that</u> strikes me as the <u>worst</u> cowardice of all - being spiritually yellow!
And his 'egghead' son!  We'll give 'em a <u>rough</u> <u>reception</u>, won't we?
Helen.  I appeal to you -
At the worst possible moment. Tomorrow is Janie's birthday. Poor little kid has looked forward for two months to having her Daddy home.  Now -
What could be worse than disappoint- ing a little girl?
Speed...about twenty-two knots. Course...due north!
Right at our one-eyed friend!
With their underwater experience, they'll be invaluable.  Take sidearms, and flare pistols --
Yes, Griff?
Why do you say that?
There is.  I believe our friend...Cyclops... is returning to life!
Take a look.
Our 'Cyclops' throws quite a thunderbolt, itself!
Alma, I think there's some dirty business going on in this town.
Always has been.
I know he's due for the last two years. I was thinking of paying it when the insurance comes in.
As a mater of fact, yes. LaRiviere.
Yeah. I know. The custody suit thing was just my getting back at her. I'm not as dumb as I look. Whatever you say. I love my daughter.  I'll send you the five hundred.
We bought you.
Don't worry, Mr. Twombley, I know where those suckers are. Rain or shine, snow or no snow. I know deer. We'll kill us a buck today. Guaranteed. Before ten.
In the chest.
Well, I didn't actually see him do it. Like I said.
What?
Let's get the fuck outta here. You're not making any sense, man.
Yeah.
Open the door. We're late.
I guess they're stupid.
It's stupid.
It's fun.
Yes.
That's fine with me too. When Mommy comes, tell her I'm up here.
Grandpa. My father. It's his.
I saw Mel Gordon in here this morning.
Mel's doing some business with me. It's nice to do favors for people you do business with. He was in a hurry. No big deal.
Let the past be.  I'm sorry about your mother. I liked her. You never know how much women like that suffer. It's like they live their lives with the sound turned off -- and then they're gone.
You know what I'm talking about. For what you're doing to me and to the child you say you love so much. Love. You won't get away with it.
See you tomorrow, maybe.
Forget it.
I'm sure, I'm positive it didn't happen the way Jack says it did.
But not now.
Yeah, but never what you looked like. Not really. Never really studied your face, like now. I was never able to see you as a kid when you were a kid until now, this way.
Look, that's temporary, believe me. There's so much shit gonna hit the fan the next few days, my getting fired by LaRiviere and Merritt won't matter a bit.
Aw, c'mon, I was only saying there's something wrong with "Home Made Cooking", that's all. The sign's fine. What it says is wrong.
Jack?
You no-good pup!
Yeah.
Yeah, brother, look, I was calling cause -- has there been anything on TV in Boston about a hunting accident with a guy named Twombley, Evan Twombley?
Twombley.
Not particularly.
We'd have to go digging in Vietnam to ask him.
Don't you even want to ask?
Big secret.  You said the same thing to Newsweek.
So, you study world events, little one. That's good for a girl your age.
Daddy...
Okay, I'm slowing us down.
cross it...  The static overwhelms the voice, then cuts out.
Sluggish... I think it's jammed too.
Uh, Tower, we got a problem up here.
Okay. Also, I want you to put our bases in Turkey on alert, and have the Kitty Hawk prepare a retaliatory air strike.
If fired upon, tell our fighters that they are ordered to engage.
Roger.
Any of us?
A secret service agent. It must be.
Avionics compartment! It's the only place. You better get Zedeck down there fast Unless, of course, you'd rather be a martyr than a savior.
Go! Take Serge.. and watch your backs.
The President and I were delighted that we could accommodate you.  Now if you're all cleared?  You can follow me then.
Three...
Over my dead body.
Call up Petrov and order Stravanavitch' S release.
Pity. Mr. Gibbs.
You heard me.  You. Congress and cabinet heads.
Yes. You've made yourself quite clear.
That isn't necessary.
No, Mr. President.  It can't.
Rose, I don't have time for this.
Flying the plane.
Excuse me?
Actually, sir, you could be that someone.
You know my policy. We don't negotiate with terrorists. If we start now, all of America becomes a target.
Okay listen, listen carefully. This is an emergency call from Air Force One. Who's there? Is the Vice- President there?
Right... Christ I'm tired.  Do me a favor and keep me away from the press.
Sir...
Twenty-five years.
Commissioner.
Yes it did.  Mr. Dunn, can I ask you a personal question?
Um...  Do you people scream right when you... you know.
Ted, I loved you and I'll always love you. But I need Simon.  He's stable.  He's a good provider.  I want that at this stage of the game, Ted.  He might have his faults, but Simon doesn't know the meaning of the word fear and I need that in a man.
Ted, you must remember what the doctor said, the first step on the road to sanity is admitting that you're sick.  Now take your electro-shock and you'll be back at the space center in no time.  And by the way, Ted, I'm leaving you for Simon.
Elaine, what's going on?
That was very well put, Ted.
What will happen to him, Ted?
Not when I'm with you, Ted.
You can be gentle with him, Elaine.  He's been working out a lot of his aggressions here in the garden.
I guess this is a first for you.
Negative.
Cut the Doubting Thomas shit, Elaine.  I know where I'm coming from on this.
Do you think things will be a lot different on Mercury, Dad?
It's going to be terrific.  A whole new world, new kids to play with.
He's a boy dog.
Joey, what's more important, the kids' clothes or your sexual potency.
What...?
Have you tried it with a little cinnamon?
Ah, yes, the Institute, I'm familiar with it.
Now he's D-Y-I-N-Ging and wants to be buried on Mercury.
No, dammit.  It's a matter of life or death.
All right, it's a matter of death.
We were in love but I'm not sure I know what love is anymore.
Love's the same as it always was.  It's people who change.
Thank you. Cream?
Oh, yes. Come in, Paul. Rex will be right out.
Well, to tell the truth, they really didn't fill me in on many of the details. Just told me to pick up Captain Kramer.
Can you fly this airplane and land it?
It's a big building with patients. But that's not important right now. Tell the Captain I must speak to him.
Extremely serious. It starts with a slight fever.
Your <u>war</u> <u>record</u>? You're the only one keeping that alive. For everyone else it's ancient history.
You expect me to believe that?
Watch your altitude, Striker. It's too erratic. You can't come straight in. You've got enough fuel left for two hours flying. You've got to stay up there 'til we get a break in the weather.
I'm sorry, son, but you must have me confused with someone else. My name is Roger Murdock. I'm the co-pilot.
I think you're the greatest. But my Dad says you don't work hard enough on defense.
I'm Lisa. Oh, you have a guitar!
It's the little room at the front of the plane where the pilots sit. But that's not important right now. The first officer is ill and the Captain would like someone with flying experience to help him with the radio. Do you know anything about planes?
You've got me all wrong.  I don't charge money for something that I myself find pleasurable...
Sergeant... Detective.  I wasn't aware there were any Newcomers at the rank of Detective yet.
It is his new partner that I'm worried about.
This is getting out of hand.  I want you to deal with it.  Immediately.
His body was discovered three days ago, in an alley off of Central Avenue, near downtown.
Nothing's wrong.  I just want to get something straight.  You agree that there's a good chance these two shootings are somehow related, right?
How the hell do you know that?
I believe I should interview the widow alone.
That's very colorful.  But see -- now I've got a problem.  I don't seem to be getting much cooperation from you, Porter.  So I guess we're gonna have to take this little session down to my office, ya know?
George, she's not gonna divorce you. You mate for life, remember?
She's very progressive.  I'm certain she's considering it.
Thank you.
We?  You've taken it?
I must trust you, Matthew.  I cannot stop this without you.
... It's Harcourt.
Harcourt is dead.
Yeah, I heard of it.
That's all I know.  You want anything more, you ask somebody else.
Come on.  You got nothin' better to do, cushy county job like yours.
Yeah, I'll bet.
Yeah, that's comforting.  Mine, too.
You're saying one of those things lays all the eggs?
See you soon.
Well, I was going to wait until after the inquest...
Amanda Ripley-McClaren.  Married name, I guess.  Age:  sixty-six ...at time of death.  Two years ago.  I'm sorry.
Well, the corporation co-financed that colony with the Colonial Administration, against mineral rights.  We're getting into a lot of terraforming...'Building Better Worlds.'
Now, wait a second --
Six meters.  Five.  What the fu --
Yeah.  I've noticed.
Stand back.
No.  Have you?
Hudson, give us a break.
What do you mean, they cut the power?  How could they cut the power, man?  They're animals.
Just get back here!
Tell him, as far as I'm concerned, he finds something it's his.
I'll be right in the other room, Newt.  And look...I can see you on that camera right up there.
That's because I blew it out the Goddamn airlock!  Like I said.
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish.
Certainly!
These Viennese certainly know good music when they hear it.
No.
How do you know?
Meaning you didn't like it.
But he needs to be here in Salzburg, Your Grace. He needs me and he needs you. Your protection, your understanding.
You have leave to try.
Why do I have to be humiliated in front of my guests by one of my own servants?
Are you drunk? You invited me. And my horse. Here he is. Ottavio!
Yes!
Eat
Well, I'm not borrowing any more money from my mother, and that's that!
Well, don't do that again!
Yes!
She won't talk to me. She says she has to speak to you.
Oh, damn!
Wolfi.
Stanzi-manzi, I'll put it in your hand!
Shut up! I'll not let you put anything in my hand until I see some money.
I'm not telling you.
Why not?
Sir, we really need this job. We're desperate. My husband spends far more than he can ever earn. I don't mean he's lazy - he's not at all - he works all day long. It's just! he's not practical. Money simply slips through his fingers, it's really ridiculous, Your Excellency. I know you help musicians. You're famous for it. Give him just this one post. We'd be forever indebted!
Don't keep calling me that. It puts me at such a distance. I was not born a Court Composer, you know. I'm from a small town, just like your husband.
That's very tempting, but it's impossible, I'm afraid. Wolfi would be frantic if he found those were missing. You see, they're all originals.
Oh yes. He's really proud of his work.
Tonight?
He needs me, ma'am.
Ah. Well. Ah,  I see you've got your manager with you. Well, Madame, how about half the receipts?
Where's our friend?
You're mad! She's mad, Wolfi.
Oh, yes.
Adorable!
Do you know who I am?  This is my daughter. I am Frau Weber. We are favoured guests!
Call Herr Mozart! You call Herr Mozart immediately! This is insupportable!
Thank you, Madame.  Come on now - courage. Play me something you know.
Majesty.
Your Highness.
I'm thinking about Herr Mozart. What is your view?
Really?
Did we vote in the end for German or Italian?
In a Pasha's Harem, Majesty. A Seraglio.
And German?
Oh, yes. Absolutely. German. Unquestionably!
My dear fellow, there are in fact only so many notes the ear can hear in the course of an evening. I think I'm right in saying that, aren't I, Court Composer?
Which few did you have in mind, Majesty?
Well, Majesty, it is only a comedy.
Very small pay, I imagine. I'm sure he could be tempted with the right offer. Say, an opera in German for our National Theatre.
Well. There it is.
Yes, what about him?
Oh we could, if we wanted to, but Stanzi won't hear of it. She wants to do everything herself.
Oh, let's not talk about it.
It's a secret.
It's too dangerous, Papa. But they're going to love it. Ah, there she is!
Papa!
You don't know what it's like. Herr Mozart frightens me. He drinks all day, then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse.
Is he working?
Please don't ask me to go back again. I'm frightened! I'm very, very frightened.
Papa, the rule is you can only give penalties that can be performed in the room.
I liked the horse.
German!
Of course! What else do you think they speak here?
Put it down, I said! It's nothing for you.
Madame.
Ah, love! Well of course in Italy we know nothing about that.
How could I not?
Your Excellency, you requested some specimens of my work. Here they are. I don't have to tell you how much I need your help. I truly appreciate your looking at these. I have pressures on me - financial pressures. As you know, I'm a married man now.
Why? Here is the music. It's here. I am submitting it humbly. Isn't that what you wanted?
Whom did they choose?
Actually, it's a big secret. Oh, this is delicious! What is it?
Oh, I could kill him! I mean really kill him. I actually threw the entire opera on the fire, he made me so angry!
How could it not, Excellency?
Who are you?
Not here! She's not well, either. She went to the Spa.
I mean to come to my opera. You are the only colleague who did.
He knows. He knows!
Would you? Actually, you could.
The end of the Recordare - Statuens in parte dextra.
A fire which never dies. Burning one forever?
Sing it back.
Yes.
We'll stop for just a moment. Then we'll do the Lacrimosa.
I'm not leaving you.
I was foolish. I thought you did not care for my work - or me. Forgive me. Forgive me!
But, Your Majesty -
It is dangerous for you to interpret His Majesty's edicts. Give me your score, please.
Why do I have to submit samples of my work to some stupid committee? Just to teach a sixteen-year-old girl.
On the contrary.
Mozart -
Show them one interesting modulation and they faint. Ohime! Morbidezza! Morbidezza! Italians are musical idiots and you want them to judge my music!
Elevated? What does that mean? Elevated! The only thing a man should elevate is - oh, excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm stupid. But I am fed up to the teeth with elevated things! Old dead legends! How can we go on forever writing about gods and legends?
I am Father Vogler. I am a Chaplain here. I thought you might like to talk to someone.
Ah - you've heard that?
And do they believe it?
Did you try?
Every day. Sometimes for hours I would pray!
Don't pity me. Pity yourself. You serve a wicked God. He killed Mozart, not I. Took him, snatched him away, without pity. He destroyed His beloved rather than let a mediocrity like me get the smallest share in his glory. He doesn't care. Understand that. God cares nothing for the man He denies and nothing either for the man He uses. He broke Mozart in half when He'd finished with him, and threw him away. Like an old, worn out flute.
Yes?
Exactly.
Ah.
What do you mean - now?
Can we come in?
Well, he's sleeping now. Better not.
Yes, Doctor.
No. He knows no one in London, besides me. I shouldn't have left him alone.
Oh, I don't mean running about on all fours and howling at the moon. But in such a deranged state he could harm himself, or perhaps others.
What shall we do?
Yes, he is. He's very excited and confused, but he's not crazy, if that's what you mean.
It was a wolf.
Aw come on, Alex!
'A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court' by Mark Twain.
Do you like it?
I dream of death mostly.
Was Jack Goodman your good friend?
My best friend. My very best friend.
Shall I read to you?
I keep having these really terrible dreams. They are getting worse and I can't seem to stop them.
What do I think? You mean about the possibility of your becoming a monster in two days or about visits from dead friends?
David, perhaps you'd like to watch the telly while I take a shower.
I was awake and he was in my room.
But, David.
It's silly of you to be apprehensive.
The zoo?
Control!?! What control!?! Get away from me!
No.
Why on earth do you say that?
Shakespeare was French! The Queen Mother sucks cocks in hell! Shit! Fuck! Piss!
You've left my wife a widow and my children fatherless. And I understand that I am to walk the earth one of the living dead until the wolf's bloodline is severed and the curse lifted.
It's nearly eight. I'm off duty shortly, then I'm off to the films with Alex.
Alex?
I should think so after your recent traumatic experiences.
Now we've just given you a pretty strong sedative, so try to get some rest now. Miss Price will see to your needs. Rest now.
Yes.
Well, anyway, do you think she'll be there?
It just fascinates me that you can spend so much energy on someone so dull.
That's not a spear. It's a pike.
David, before we go in there I want you to know that - no matter what happens to us - it's your fault.
It's a five-pointed star.
You ask them.
Beware the moon?
Come on, I'm freezing.
I have no idea.
Walk away, Jack.
I'm aware that I don't look so great, but I thought you'd be glad to see me.
Hurting your feelings? Has it occurred to you that it may be unsettling to have you rise from your grave to visit me? Listen to me, I'm talking to a hamburger!
So you know what she does? She's so grief stricken she runs to find solace in Rudy Levine's bed.
David, now I know this may be hard for you, but I have to warn you.
Will you be quiet?!
You're talking like Boris Karloff! It's movie dialogue!
What, Jack? That tomorrow night beneath the full moon I'll sprout hair and fangs and eat people? Bullshit!
Aren't you going to say, 'I told you so'?
Come in, come in. Please sit. Some tea?
Campari and soda would do nicely.
Oh, that's been there for two hundred years. We were going to paint it out, but it's traditional, so we left it.
But I can heat some up for you if you'd like.
Yeah.
When he comes in, tell him we're waiting for him in the board room.
Take it easy, Clark.
Just pure luck!
I have everything I own in it. It's your bank as well as mine, isn't it?
The bank. All right. Do anything you want with it.
We've been waiting fifteen minutes—
Of course, yes. Just what would you like to know, Inspector?
He won't believe it, Mr. Dickson. But it's the truth - honest it is. I was in my apartment last night - ask your wife - she—
That don't do us any good.
For a celebrated bounder, that is an awful admission. Besides, I never knew that any female could do this to you .
Now wait a minute, wait a minute...
I'll grow a moustache by the time you get out of here.
Let me see your cash book, will you?
Oh, yeah?
Much better this morning, thank you.
Thank you!
It's amazing that your sweet, lovely, gorgeous wife can ever get to see you.
Oooh! That has the earmarks!
That's what it was you planned, wasn't it?
Guess we'll just have to sacrifice the bank. When are you and Matt going to get married?
Yes, sir.
My goodness, you ought to have a uniform. How much does one cost?
And what's more, keep up the good work and who knows - some day you'll be the fellow sitting behind that desk . . .  Not a bad thought, eh?
Wait a minute. Answer my question. Was Mrs. Dickson there?
It's an inside job. That's a cinch. Whoever did it had a pretty good picture of the layout. Now Brown, here, is in charge of the vaults, isn't he?
All right. Send down to the vaults and have our reserve cash sent up here right away.
Is that busy husband of mine busy?
Board meeting. Oh, that means hours, I suppose.
Well . . . ?
I tell you, I saw them!
All right, dear.
Are you sure?
Dude Finlay?
Yes, sir.
I'm okay, Matt.
Yeah, what did he do with his first one?
Never a good thing.
Anywhere nobody's shooting at me is pretty.
Zee, I'm pleased you came.
The sheriff says it was a gang of drunk Kansas boys.
Frankly, yes. I'm feeling a little left out.
I can hit those boys from here. We just need a distraction.
They said because the detectives were working for the Department of the Interior --
Not yet. But I'm hoping.
Hey!
No, really. You're wife said she needed some help, seeing as you were so fat you couldn't find your --
I could use the walk.
Don't let it happen again.
Just because he reads all those books and knows all those big words doesn't make him smart.
I got us through the War all right.
Pass me some whisky.
I'm out.
I'm thinking...
-- Exactly. Because this is a war.
They're just insurance in case we run.
Of course!  Uh, sir?
Ho-yah. Him say tell Big Lawman in Carville that badman Jesse James riding toward Rising Sun, above Great River, near Eagle Rock.
East? East above the river heading for the Eagle Pass?
Pff. He jumped his horse clear over our heads, killed a dozen Union soldiers before they knew what hit them.
So we got a plan?
All this time in the saddle... We get to the farm, I'm going to shoot this damn horse just on principle.
What kind of story are they going to believe?
You are a charmer.
Make a thousand of 'em. Still won't be enough by the time I'm through.
It's the scientific method. It's all the rage.
We're doing this for Ma.
Got any ideas, little brother?
I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.
Hell, they hardly even noticed us.
But he killed a lot of men, too.
You planning on being a bachelor your whole life, Jesse James?
Not if I find the right girl.
Little ones.
That's why I picked it. We can start a whole new life down here.
"Blazing Guns of the West. True Stories of Jesse James." Only a dime in the hotel lobby.
Stop it. This is just sad.
If you don't see it, it's not real...
I can't believe I had to blow up a train for you.
I figured.
Should have just killed Thaddeus Rains and been done with it.
That's what I would have done.
I'm not hanged yet.
You cocky little bastard.
Thanks.
Thank you.
Who needs to repair a leaky church roof.
Communion.
And the same age Web was. No.
Jesse, you explain to Lyla. My girl, you know, from that time...
Gosh, that's a pretty name. Buy you a drink?
NO! It is NOT my pleasure to have to leave my board room to come to this godforsaken piece of dirt to discover why in the name of all that is holy you cannot seem to evict a few simple farmers from their PATHETIC LITTLE MUDHOLES so that I may build the GREATEST railroad that this country has ever seen!
Yes sir.
I'll teach these podunks what happens when they challenge the righteousness of progress.
I look forward to seeing it.
What is that?
I remember you.
Oh no, I would have done that. But I would have made sure I killed them, too.
This is no game.
All of the James Gang's encounters have been with local law enforcement who, quite frankly, are no match for this group's cunning.
Can't you tell me anything?
Why, their intense hatred of you, of course.
Nice?
Is that Donald Trump's car?
Are we here?
Pull out, goddamnit!
Turn the light on.
Patrick. Turn on the Light. He turns on the light.
Take it off.
Oh God, just get it over with.
Yes, Courtney?
Well, I actually might need a little surgery after last time.
Is your Evian spiked?
I don't want to talk about it.
Because I...want...to...fit...in.
He's rich.
He's good-looking.
Everybody's good-looking, Patrick.
Everybody has a great body now.
Talk about what, Patrick? What is there to talk about?
But your friends are my friends. My friends are your friends. I don't think it would work.  You have a little something on your upper lip.
Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ, Bateman.
No, serial killer, Wisconsin in the fifties. He was an interesting guy.
The message you left.
But wait, Harold, what do you mean?
Wait. Stop. You don't seem to understand. You're not really comprehending any of this. I killed him. I did it, Carnes. I'm Patrick Bateman. I chopped Owen's fucking head off. I tortured dozens of girls. The whole message I left on your machine was true.
Uh huh.
This is Gwendolyn Ichiban. This is my very good friend Patrick Bateman. Where are you going? We're going to Nell's. Gwendolyn's father's buying it.  Where did you get your overnight bag?
It looks that way, doesn't it?
Maybe it's just the light.
Two at nine? Perfect.
Can you bring Mr...
Oh Patrick, I can't make this decision.
You can always he thinner. Look...better.
Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner. I don't want to ruin your willpower.
What do you think I do?
What?
Maybe we could have lunch one day next week? You know, I'm downtown near Wall Street quite often.
Uh huh?
You actually listen to Whitney Houston? You actually have a Whitney Houston CD? More than one?
Oh that? Just mulling over business problems. Examining opportunities...Exchanging rumors... Spreading gossip.
You're not with the FBI or anything, are you?
Coffee?
It's no problem
Understandable.  Lime?
How old are you?
Harvard. The Harvard Business School.
Well...
He led what I suppose was an orderly life. He... ate a balanced diet.
We were both seven in 1969.
So was I.
No, it actually hadn't. Toiletries were missing. A suit was gone. So was some luggage. That's it.
Isn't the Four Seasons a little far uptown? I mean aren't you going to be late?
Uh, no. There's one...down here.
Great, and thanks for your, uh, time, Mr. Bateman.
Don.
Yeah. No Finlandia, as usual. Fucking dump.
Listen, I'm a little spent for now but how about lunch in a week or so when I've sorted out all this information?
And?
Why don't you get a job? If you're so hungry, why don't you get a job?
Do ,you know how bad you smell? The stench, my God.
I've been great. And you?
Nobody goes there anymore.
Why are there copies of the Style section all over the place? Do you have a dog? A chow or something?
Is that a raincoat?
Yes, it is.
They still have to give 'em refreshments laced with mind-altering drugs.
But he's not quite the same guy anymore. Don't get your hopes too high?
No way. You have this -- destiny.
C'mon, I wouldn't have a destiny without you. My destiny would be dying at 20. From eating --
Prob'ly waiting by the phone for Outpost to call. We'll leave it for him?
You're right. It's -- a working relationship. Don't know what I was expecting.
Teddy was killed last night.
You can't just walk in, either.
They stop the construction work at six or seven. The parking lot's mostly clear by two or three in the morning. Even the early Geeks don't get there before five.
...Whaddo I do?
Guilt?
Okay, yeah. I did something naughty... There's this amazing Comix store in Seattle.  To tell you the truth, I did it once or twice at Stanford. 'Guess I can't keep anything from you...
Milo, you --
Oh, right. Hold on.
You're just afraid to eat it.
He'll tell me when he gets home.
Lisa's an extremely valuable member of the Skywire team. We've got our eyes on her. You keep yours on Milo.
Prick.
Beggar. We're at a disadvantage with Outpost. Our experts aren't as smart as theirs. Sometimes we can't tell which technologies pose the threat of a monopoly. We need a really smart guy to help us pick our fights. I'm taking a shot in the dark, here. I can offer you 32,000 a year, a Buick. I'm hoping you've got a feeling it's the right thing to do.
Have a seat.
Sure, I'll see what I can do.
You better believe everybody's trying to sign him up.
Oh. No thanks.
You're making me young again.
Right... Right.
I meant did you find other stuff to --
The answer's not in the box. It's in the band.
You look a little tired.
Just do what I'm asking!
Just do it.
Unlikely. All 14 cameras are frozen. Do we call Randy and Phil? Tell 'em there may have been a break-in?
Let's get him in here.
No, I know what you mean. I used to spend my life wishing people could be like computers. Least they make sense. Sometimes you think they've betrayed you. Like a person would. But then you see, no, you just missed a step. You can go back and make it all work.
Show me.
We could cross-reference a data base on media ownership. But not on our own computers. Not even at home.
Yeah, they dig stuff like this.  "CBS News has partnered with Outpost Information Systems in a cable news network due to launch Fall of 2001."
He's got 12 satellites up. He's got dishes on top of 21. He's building this --  mega-network for Skywire. Let's use it.
Gary.
The dishes are juiced up, too.
Oh.
At this point the worst thing I could do is anything out of the ordinary.
What?
Outpost made me sign 1,000. 'Guess we'll find out what else we have to talk about. Life stuff.
Oh we're not going to the campus.
We're all grateful for that. Really. Go out the way you came in?
Oh, you're very clever. Let's make love, you silly, hairy little man.
Thank you, Exposition.
Thank you, Exposition. Only two things, scare me, and one is nuclear war.
What?
Not quite, actually. Vanessa, I have something for you.
Well, you can't always get what you want.
Groovy!
Don't try to suck up to me! It's a little late for that. I'm a freak! Look at it, it's been rendered useless.
No, Mr. Powers, I expect them to die. Even after they pay me the money, I'm still going to melt all the cities of the world with hot magma.  All right, guard, begin the unnecessarily Slow-Moving Dipping Mechanism.
My mother's told me all about you.
If it's a lie, goddamn her. It it's the truth, goddamn me.  God, I hope that's witty. How's your mum?
I'm sorry?
What?
Let me see.
No worries, luv. We'll just give Basil a tinkle on the telling bone...
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry that bug up your ass had to die.
I can't believe you made love to her just like that. Did you use protection?
Of course, I had my nine-millimeter automatic.
Not in the Nineties.
Basil was very concerned to know where you were last night.
I'm looking at you, and the whole time I can't help thinking you had your willie inside her hootchie-kooch.
Not now, Austin.
Hold on a tick, let me put on my togs.
Don't worry!
I'll secure the perimeter.
I'm telling you, baby, that's not mine.
Hey, wait a minute--
I'm going to go across the street and get you some sherbert.
Can't you see I'm only half a man? Look at me, I'm a freak!
Yes.
Well, we experimented with lasers, but you would be surprised at how heavy they are. They actually outweighed the piranha themselves, and the fish, well, they sank to the bottom and died.
Please allow me to demonstrate.
We've heard from Scott, now let's hear from you.
No, we'll leave them alone and not actually witness them dying, and we'll just assume it all went to plan.
Great.
Seriously?
As real as you wish. Hot or cold. Humid or dry. Anything you like. Within reason.
... bottle ...
... love...
So I'm still ...
Ah, but you haven't see the real me. Watch closely ...
No women. Not in Boodles. Not since 1922.
Quite right, but we still make the rules.
The doors and walls are monitored, Mrs. Peel. This is a very secure establishment.
Thanks, Valentine ...
For starters. Of course I had to kill the Teddy Bears, as well ...
Destruction of their local weather systems. I can zap a thousand Chernobyls into the air.
Then what's stopping you?
What are my choices?
And you must be Steed. Please don't get up.
We're not here to talk about the weather, surely.
As per mother's instructions.
Small talk.  Try the weather.
Either way ... may I ask: why you dress in that fashion?
Very good, Steed ...
Well, he was a fellow of the Royal Zoological Society ...
Common knowledge, Mrs. Peel ...
Sounds as if someone's hijacked your research.
Not that I know of.  Explanation?
Is that all?
Not for a moment.
You're playing games.
Winning isn't everything.
After you -- Mrs. Peel ...
As far as you trust me.
When all this is over, we simply must get you out of that suit.
But --
Must be. Trubshaw's busy. I'll send Mother ...
I'm no spy -- where do I fit in?
Mobile HQ. In a blue funk.  Can't take chances. I'm looking after things while he's hiding out ...
I know all this.
We want Mrs. Peel.
Dead, I'm afraid.
You reek of Mrs. Peel's Black Leather ...
Amnesia?
This way ...
Let it be rain, please let it be --
If you say so.
I do.
Deb, I want to throw you a shower.
You're kidding.
Too bad, man, that blows my chance to be Ambassador to France.
I'm marrying Debbie.
Oh, come on, just a little.
Yes, sir, I am.
Over here, Deb... in the Smokehouse.
What are we having?
I think your dinner's burning.
Of course. I'm a traditional guy... It's a traditional event.  Well, what do you think?
Yes, but looks are deceiving...  Not in this case, however.
Um... that's very relaxing.
You're really pissing me off.
Your mother's not dead.
Anything you say, ma'am. Have a fun shower. Use soap.
C'mon, I knew it was you.
Rick, you're lying!
Yes...
Ilene, we don't really know that.
A real turd.
Your whores never showed up.
What are you...
Yes.
I need them for a bachelor party at the Park View Hotel.
You are being in luck. Customers in same hotel. I let you have them at cut-rate price for 45 minutes.
Sold. 45 minutes. No problem.
C'mon, Larry. Be good for you.
What do you know, they moved it. Catch you later.
I see what you mean... You're a beautiful guy. And you're doing a damn good job.
Good. I think you're an asshole. No, let me correct that, an immature asshole. Which is fine, except you're marrying my daughter and I'm afraid my grandchildren are going to be little assholes.
Mr. Thomerson, I...
No. Let's at least finish the set.
You can tell a man by his friends.
The phone made me do it!
My gift to you.
Oooooo.
That's the old Rick!
Put it to you this way -- you're gonna have to pry her out of the bed with a spatula, mister.
Take care.
Who's your friend?
What can I do? I'm dead. Debbie's going to go crazy and end the whole thing.
I'll stop him... You stall him.
True, you're a lot handsomer now. Don't you have enough blood already?
Great.  I was wondering, how do you guys go to the bathroom in that thing?
Right... Think it over.
No.  I need a drink.
Ah, everybody screws up some, Brian. You're working for the toughest Lt. on the job. Saw him once pick up a probie he thought was moving too slow and throw him into a burning building. It's just bad luck you're family.
He's alive.
Well, see you're wrong already. Had a talk with Chief Fitzgerald, and we decided in the interest of brotherly love, that maybe you shouldn't be way over on the other side of town. So starting tomorrow, your assigned to company 17. My company.  One case of scotch, you're getting cheap in your old age, Brian...
It's comin' along... want a beer?
What, you've never seen one before?
Millions, Stephen -- And sexual favors.
I think you're gonna find out, Brian. Don't be late tomorrow.
-- I was doin' it! I was up there fucking doin' it. You don't know, man, you don't know what I did!
-- Never mind.
You said you wanted to know something, Brian. What did you learn today?  What do you say, Brian, huh? Time to move on?
So hello.
...Jesus, you been carrying that around for twenty years? For christ's sake, you were seven years old! You think he could have heard you in there?
I hate him so much sometimes, Stephen. You don't know how hard it was for me to put that uniform on...
Maybe I do.  ...What a fuckin' mess, huh?  People can change Brian.
I know.
How do you know?
What are we going to do about this?
"You never know till the fire stares you down if you're gonna be --"
Jennifer.
Thanks for calling.
Huh.
Let me tell you something. Martin Swayzak is going to be this town's next mayor.
Why do you think Marty came here tonight? Because he cares about your department. You don't know how hard he works. You don't know about his programs helping West Side --
...Okay. I'll arrange things with your assignment captain.  Marty's a good man, Brian.
I don't know, I'm kinda swamped here.
Well, you did invite me here.
When I came back, I knew more than anything else that I wanted to be a fireman.
I was doing my job.
-- I work for the city.
Hi.
After it took your dad... the fire... did it look at you Brian? Did it talk to you?...
Your Dennis' kid.  I work alone.
Pest control.
What are you listening to?
-- Go to the bottom. Under heat properties.
Ever burned magnesium? It's so hot it takes water molecules and BAMM!
That's why the sealant on the doors... So what have we got, a torch with a conscience?
Are you going public with this?
Just wondering.
I've been lying here hours... just thinking... We're close...  We're not looking in the right place, Brian. This one knows us and we're not looking in the right place...
Nice boat.
Yeah. In fact, I just dropped off a letter to the Times explaining how yesterday's arson announcement was a fabrication by your office. They loved it. And you know what? You were right, my family background in firefighting gave it weight.
How'd you know? These are supposed to be sealed.
Ah man, if you're gonna bribe your way into a station, why not 17 with me and your brother?
Ah man, is he usin' that line now on you? What, you think he made that little gem up? Jesus Christ, I used to have to listen to my old man use that every morning.
Management were pin heads.
Sorry I hit Jackson.
Yeah? When was the last time?
Trychticholorate? Alright, it's an absorption catalyst in toxic waste accidents. It's pretty rare, they stopped making it a couple'a years ago.
Did he tell you how we finally met?
Are the glory boys actually showing interest in Investigation's work? I may have a stroke.
I deal with this stuff every day. But a fireman... you never get used to it.  What happened up there? He was a candidate. Did he pay attention? Was he listening?
Investigator...
Yeah? At least she's alive! I see people get killed every day! Worse yet, tortured first and then killed! The nuns got off easy. Jeez. Cigarette burns. Everyone's all upset about fucking cigarette burns. I'll show you cigarette burns!
Those fucking Mob assholes.
Then c'mere. I got something for you.
A wiseguy. Paying 100 Grand for the rapists if I turn then over direct to him.
I was gonna bring it back myself.
You can't forgive me. After what I've done.  I've fucked up bigtime. I've been bad. Real bad.
It's still my money. If you want to have a chance at any part of it, shithead, you will take my $120,000 and bet on tomorrow's game.
There's just no way the Mets will lose this game. Gooden is pitching and Strawberry is ready to break out.
The fucking rapists, man. The punks who raped that nun. The $50,000 reward from the Church! Remember?
It's funny, you knew. But the first thing I think of is kneading the bread that I help bake for the soup kitchen. Maybe that's because my the muscles in my arms still hurt.
Yes, Sister?
I didn't mean to scare you like that.
Whoa, hold up li'l sis'.  I done told you 'bout that.  Julius ain't my name, you better recognize Hopkins was our slave name.  My true name is...
What makes you think he would write a show about the Mau-Mau's.
Microphone check.  One.  Two.  One. Two.  One.  Two.  Hold up.  I gots to give my peeps some props. Brothers introduce yourself.
What do I do?
You ain't happy about the green light?
Jim Jones, y'know.  I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.
You'd take no offense if we called you DeLa for short?
If it's not too much trouble could you order us some food?
We're starving.
Forget it.  I believe you're my most creative person I've got on staff.  You're hip.  You know what's happening.  I got some corny white boys and girls writing for me.
I'm telling you it's not.
I'm an oreo, a sell out?  Because I don't aspire to do HOMEBOYS FROM OUT OF SPACE, SECRET DIARY OF DESMOND PFEIFFER, A PJ's or some as you might put it, some "nigger" show?  I'm a Tom?  I'm whiter than white and you're blacker than black? Is that what you think?
I've done a lot of soul searching and once again you are right.  In my previous work it's been all surface, superficial.  I have never really dug deep.  Not anymore.  As Mark Twain fully understood satire is the way.  Race has always been a hot button in this country's history and it needs to be pushed harder.  If we are ever to live side by side in peace and harmony. It's about promoting racial healing.
I want you take it there.  All the way to the edge and back.
Ignorant, dullwitted, lazy, and unlucky.
This could be bigger than "Amos and Andy."
Let'em try.  I will kill to make this happen.
So what.  We would just give the NAACP a donation that would be the end of that.  No such thing as bad publicity.  So what.  Earlier you said singing and dancing.
Do we have characters?  How about Honeycutt, Snowflake, Rastus, Nigger, Jim, Sambo, Jungle Bunny, and how could we forget Aunt Jemima.
I just want you to meet him.  Keep an open mind.
This has to be a big mistake.
The big mistake was my not believing in your genius earlier.  From the gitgo, from jump street.
It's me, Peerless.
Another one of your conspiracies to hold ya career back?
It hit me like a ton of bricks.
Why did you even come up with that shit if you didn't want it made?
What's the chances of MANTAN being picked up?
I've never worked with any of you and you've never worked with me so we'll be starting from scratch. I'm a fair person, a straight shooter and I don't hold my tongue. Everybody up in here should know I had nothing to do with you being hired. 
This is authentic, not a repro, circa turn of the century.
Please don't go there.
DeLa, kiss my big black ass.
I didn't think this was in your studies at NYU.
Give me the gun.
I didn't mean it to sound like that.
Sloan is the hardest working person I've ever met.
Let me ask you a question, if I may. How do you think she got the job in the first place?  I don't mean to burst your bubble, Mantan the Marvelous, but Sloan is an opportunity.
I said no such thing.  All I said is that something must be wrong.
Can't beat it with a hammer.  Well, since you asked, it looks like I may have a new show, a pilot being shot.
I guess he's still on the road. What kind of show is this?  Are they some Negroes in it without being buffoons?
Not at all?
Soon.
Then will you teach me what I need to know.  Maybe we learn from each other, if that's possible, no?
Thank you.  And always smile.
Are you and him kicking it? Knocking boots. Y'knowwhatI'mtalkin'bout.
I'm more comfortable around my people.
I don't know what a retort is, but it's simple.  Mantan - The New Millennium Minstrel Show is UNIVERSAL.  It's not just for Negroes in Compton or 125th in Harlem.  This is America.  Our ancestors helped build this country, we got a right, just like everybody else.  I'm not gonna box myself in. This show makes people think, and they're laughing at the same time.
...to big.  The in-between one, not too tight, not too lose.
I thought you got rid of...
...aconite get it dat cheap.
...like fried and chicken...
A song a comin' I feel.
Are you trying to rap to me?
What?
Aw, c'mon.
Good morning.
What is your uncle's name?
There is lately come to Berlin a gentleman in the service of the Empress Queen, who calls himself the Chevalier de Belle Fast, and wears the red riband and star of the pope's order of the Spur.  He is made for good society, polished, obliging, a libertine, without prejudices, fond of women, of good food, of high play, prudent and discreet.
I am not sure.  The Prince told him quite clearly that if he wished to have the money, he would have to fight for it.
Oh!  That will be sent after him.  I have a fancy to look into that red box which contains his papers, you say; and at noon, after parade, shall be at the inn.  You will not say a word to any one there regarding the affair, and will wait for me at the Chevalier's rooms until my arrival.  We must force that box.  You are a clumsy hound, or you would have got the key long ago.
And so I am.
And now you risk the same fate.  If you are killed, your mother is all alone in the world.
I suppose she addressed them to me in my real name, by which I never thought to ask for them at the post office.
Which O'Higgins do you know?  For I have never heard your name mentioned in my family.
Ah -- I see.  No, I'm afraid mine are the O'Higgins of Watertown.
I deny your Grace's accusations, and beg you to say how you have been cheated?
For whom else have you worked?
I'd give five years of my life to see the old country again, the greenfields, and the river, and the old round tower, and the burying place.
On the instant.  Everyone must yield to such a nobleman as you.
But, for a time... a passing fancy?
Have you not a man whom you value?
It is only too possible.  Love requires a mutual harmony which is difficult, and it is even more difficult to make it last.
I agree; but God put us on earth to take that risk.
The amusing thing is that you deceive me without knowing, if it is true that you love me.
Always, my dear one, never any further.  Love is a child to be pacified with trifles.  A full diet can only kill it.
As soon as I saw you loved me, I was pleased, and I gave you every opportunity to fall more in love with me, being certain that, for my part, I would never love you.  But after our first kiss, I found that I had no power over myself.  I did not know that one kiss could matter so much.
Agreed.
I had not been in the room five minutes before I was engaged for every single set.
What, with me on the pillion?  Would you kill poor me?
It is entirely up to you.  I want the best.
Do you happen to know Gustavus Adolphus, the thirteenth Earl of Crabs?
Well, we'll just have to wait and see, won't we?
What the devil?  What kind of fools do we have here?  Pottle, who told the lad this story?
I beg your pardon?
I hope that you are not thinking of leaving us soon, knight?
He loves me, as I love you.
Tender Hegenheim.
It's ten thirty in the morning.
Yeah, and I could've used the sleep. I'm supposed to meet people here tonight, try and get some work going.
Whoever it is isn't shooting at us...
We found him like this --
I don't know!
We don't know. West is dead.
Well, why didn't you say so? We'll just drop all your charges, then --
You saved Kendall's life --
Do what?
No, ma'am, he just wanted us to quit. Making it through was kind of an honor. Some of the other guys on the base told us that if you could hack Section Eight, Command would consider you at the top of the class.
Tell us about the other guys, the ones West weeded out.
Epilepsy.
One went off, yeah, but it didn't touch him -- I thought you knew this --
Sir, yes, sir!
We just want to check your pack --
Yeah...
Maybe, but that don't make me a killer --
Mueller.
Oh, come on --
Levi, you got about four hours before armed men show up here, put you on a plane to Washington, and lock you in a very small dark room. I suggest you talk to us.
The Sergeant discovered this relationship and wanted me expelled. My father interceded, so instead, West Sectioned me and made sure every other cadet knew that I was gay.
I honestly don't know. Maybe to have someone to cover for him. And I wish I could, but there's no doubt in my mind he killed those men.
My heart weeps.
Dunbar was running out the door? Ohhhhhh... See that's where I was confused, because I thought you said Nunez was running out the door.
No. I said Dunbar.
But you can't prove it! You can't prove anything until we find the bodies!
Where are they!
No, the problem is one's dead, one's got a bullet in his arm, and one won't talk. The one who won't talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pick-up.
Without the body we have no physical proof. We need a confession.
That's horseshit and you know it.
I'm not going to cover for you, Bill. Not for this.
That's preposterous --
You want to get into a finger pointing contest about character? The army kicked you out for drugs, the cops fired you for taking bribes from a mobster, and you think you can stand there and lecture me on codes of conduct? There's only one criminal standing in this room and it's you.
Senator Jonathan Kendall, of Ohio.
Excuse me?
I plan to grow on you.
Because it's my job. Because people are dead. Because of the whole honor and duty thing, make a difference in the world, crap like that.  We can do this, Hardy.
Positive. Hardy, they planned this.
See, I just take your gun to the morgue and fire it into one of their skulls; then I call every newspaper in the country with the story about how Senator Kendall's gay son went nuts on a training mission --
Hardy, for Chrissakes --
Far as I'm concerned, whatever you did in the past can stay in the past.
I should probably write that down.
Yeah. But he was a lot of other things, too. Thanks.
What are you talking about?
A gay Senator's son who let his Sarge get fragged on a training exercise? The press'll crucify you and your father. His career will be over and it'll be your fault. But we do this different and you come out a hero.
Poor fucker my ass...
I'm about two seconds away from seeing if fairies really can fly --
To start a fire, goddammit!  What about him, huh? Maybe he offed the Sarge and changed shirts, brought an extra one in his pack. Y'ever think of that? Go ahead, cut him loose! First chance he gets, he'll waste the rest of us, that's how they work --
What, "The Truth"? Please. There are degrees of truth, officer, always degrees. Things are not what they seem.
So you framed him. The same way Childs was going to frame Pike.
What the fuck are you doing?
Yeah.
You mean Ray Dunbar? Well, that ain't right.
He's not Army, it's not official --
We know.
Those who I deem unworthy to pass through this camp will quit, and those who refuse to quit I will kill. You ever hear of a training accident -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
Sir, yes, sir!
I've got a whole backpack full of clothes!
A few rabbits, but I think one of them was already dead.
I don't expect to.
I brought it.
Don.
What the hell are you doing? This is my girl. Mine!
Dr. Bennett. It's good to see you.  My wife, Josephine.
No.
Well, she... uh...
Eighteen.
I suspect it will hurt a lot.
It's not like you're going to lose anything. You can ask anyone in town. I've been nothing if not generous. I want the best for everyone.
I see. I thank you for your time.
I'll...
Will never told you that?  Probably just as well. He would have told it all wrong anyway. All the facts and none of the flavor.
I love every square inch of it. But I can feel the edges closing in on me. A man's life can only grow to a certain size in a place like this.  So what do you say? Join me?
I'm not scared.
Really.
The Old Lady by the swamp.
True story.
Yes.
Can we talk?
It would kill you, huh?
Okay. Okay.
Somehow, you're better. Different. You're getting ready to go. And I say...
There is no softer ground than town.
This was on his sales route, so he was through here all the time. Everyone in town knew him.
I've seen him with women. He flirts. He always has. On some level, I presumed he was cheating on my mother. I just never had proof.
No, it's logical if you think like your father. See, to him, there's only two women: your mother and everyone else.
I know. It was the same when I was carrying Will. Like clockwork.
What about the details? How they fell in love. The Circus. The War. You never told me any of that.
That's because most of it never happened.
What is "true?" I've never heard my father say a single true thing.
How much time does he have left?
You don't talk about those things. Not yet.
Yes.
Yes, Will, I do. And don't presume things you don't know.
Right.
No, no...
Oh nothing.
Tell me.
I suppose it's... I mean define your terms.
I have brought you trouble. Maybe I should have come alone.
He wants money.
Tell him to put the kettle down and I'll give him money.
I bet.  What about me? Am I how you imagined?
Syevodnya
It's makes it easier. Okay.
I do. I want to very badly.
Have you got your passport?
Fine. Absolutely. Must be disappointing though. Must come as a hell of a shock.
And who says what is wrong.
What's a moral orgasm John? Tell me how it feels exactly.
There's nothing wrong in liking sex, John.
So what did you want? I think we understand each other, no?
I wasn't saying anything.
The rest of the world, John, it's not all like St. Albans.
I'm pretty naive? Look at you. You have to do all this, and what have you got to show for it? Nothing.
Well what have you got?
No.
She's dead.
I don't know why I said that. She's not dead at all.
I smoke more these days. I smoke more when I'm unhappy.
Okay. Promise?
Please.
It's more like a date.
Tell me about it.
Yeah, I know.
Oh! Gave me a start.
Yes?
No, ma'am.
Can I put it in your mouth?
I'll take a jar of that, too.
They been keepin' a folder on me cuz of my stomach. Like how it was just before we'd play ball back in school. Thought it was just some tic I got, or ulcers like my daddy had.  I can't... shoot. Target practice I'm a pro. I tag between the numbers each time but...  But when there's really loud noises around me... somethin' happens. I get shaky and... I lose my breath. They called it anxiety. Severe anxiety. It can be fixed and all... just not in time for....  It's a long process but... they sent me home.
You joined up in that monkey troop cuz you had a plan for yourself. Army'd pay for school. You were gonna get a degree, maybe somethin' in business or agriculture and you were gonna make somethin' of yourself.
Make yourself at home. You done it already.
Yeah.
My Daddy told me that a younger woman would bleed me dry. And that's what you did. Ya bled me.
I ain't laid a hand on ya but to ease yo fever... Remember like I say, I found you in the road...
We got everything we need. Plenty of food. Ya medicine still got a few good swallows in it...
Whose doin' is that?
Itches.
I know. I get it. What's Matthew doin'?
No one's gonna hurt you no more.
I tried.
I know you didn't. But you a grown girl. You can handle it. I got to.
Get a good picture in your mind.
That ain't my scene. If that's somethin' you into...
See, that girl is in my favor. You heard me, nigga? You fuck with her rough, and you got me to fuck wit.
Go ask him.
He's fine. Just had a bad fall.
R.L., you gonna have to get on. I can't have nobody round my place.
A naked woman, chained in ya house?
Laz, I know about that girl.  Good number of this town's sinners got my ear, you know.  Oh, Laz. She's had a mess of crabs and them STD's. What'chu thinking?
I haven't laid a hand. On my life, R.L., my wick is dry on this.
I gotta ask you. Why do you think Laz is keepin' you chained like this?
You can't hurt people... and then just say, I'm sorry, and then everything just gets washed away. Why would heaven want people like that. People who... do what they want and then... switch.
Yeah?
Are you wasted?
Yeah. I know I did. But...  I'm tryin' to be dif'rent. I'm tryin' to... get some peace, you know?
I'm workin' here, Rae. Can you see that?
The hell are you talkin' about?
But... Momma... just tell me... not gonna be mad... we can just talk about it... Be eye to eye on this... You don't even got to say you're sorry... Just say how you knew...
Thanks.
-- I should tear your head off.
Who do you think the Jap is?
Charlie, take your gum, stick it under your ass and keep it warm.
First decent idea you've had.
What'd she say?
The mayor's office, under the bed, the back room at Lombardi's.  And call me Ich.
Give us a break...
Leave the rice cake outside and go home!
They made you leave your hotel...  ... you caused a disturbance.
Why weren't you at the platform?
I'll get him for you, Nick.
No.  Don't say anything.  Don't do anything, and for Christ's sake, don't apologize!
I'll check it out.
Shut-up.
I want to yank Kobo.
Big enough.
It's illegal, Nick.
It's a new deal.  ... coming with me tomorrow?
I followed them.  An hour from the train station.
I couldn't tell.
I'm sorry.
Joyce, give the assistant Chief Inspector a drink, would you?
I could use some help.  Show me around.  I'll pay you for your time.
I don't give tours.
He's on duty.
What if I chant?
Time, I've got plenty of.
He's wanted in Japan.  They want him first.  Then we can have him.
Incompetent is letting people waltz through a secure area wearing your uniforms, carrying official documents.
Your visa has expired.  Be on a plane in twenty-four hours or you will be deported.
Twenty-four hours, detective.
If anything happens to her while I'm here --
You're smarter than Kobo.  You know the price of deceit.  Think about it.
Well stocked.
Not to be trapped.
Put it this way.  Rolls Royces are made to last -- as least they were. But I'm afraid you're a Ferrari. A high strung racing car -- built to win, not to last.
Nothing the God of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven for.
Well, actually
You mean that you can't come here and I can't go there?
When?
Where do we start?
Yeah.
Longevity is classified.  No.
Ya.
I don't know.
These aren't just...
Listen, I could make you a long list of complaints about this fucken city but I still rather be here than up there.
They'll change the limit before I change my mind.
Can I come in?
What night?
What the fuck for?
And who do I go to about you?
I know you think it complicates your work, but I'm here to help.
I work alone.
Not too good.
That's another thing I can't do.
Like?
Don't be fooled by appearances.
Never mind the plug, just go through the motions.
Andies only simulate suffering -- if they're programmed for it.
What?
You know where I been.  I been on vacation.
Memory implant.  She was programmed. But I think she has transcended her conditioning.  I think she was beginning to suspect.
Discreetly.
All pertinent information is being fed into your departmental computer, an Esper 231 -- I believe -- and a photo over-lay packet is being produced.
What desert?
What about friends?
Thanks.
Bravo!
Come where?
Yes, ma'am.
I do fine, Adam.  How 'bout yourself?  You doin' any good?
No, I'm lost.
No.
My Mom and Dad.
Very funny, smart ass.
No problem.  We'll just sell another baseball card.
What for?
Why?!
It didn't used to be that way.
No dogs, huh? Okay.
Um-hum.
Wow.
In the house?
May I please be excused?
Wazoo!  Try to listen.  Whataya think? Surfer, grunge, hip- hop, Euro trash?
Yep.  You know, my father -- who is a scientist -- says that everything is a miracle. Everything. Until recently I wasn 't sure what he meant by that.
No it's not!
Yes!
And don't be so obvious!
It's a Rob Roy. A very popular drink, I'm told.
Yes, really! Basically, they want what they think they can't have.  Same with guys.  That's why everybody is walking around here sending off "you can't have me" signals!
Okay. All right.  And what do I say?
Goodnight!
Well, you had better!!
...I do.
My mother's like that.
Latin exam, Dad.  It's Tuesday.
The nocturnal flying mammal?
Why?
No kidding!
I'll try.
Not particularly.
Well, I hope you like these! Fresh sea urchin wrapped in seaweed. Or "nori" if you prefer. I love sushi.
Yeah.
How do you get through those winters?  Well, you're right.  Juneau.  What's the highest peak?
Mt. McKinley.  It's also the highest point in North America.
Oh, yes.  It would probably kill him.
Bye, Adam!
I see.  Well, thank you very much. You've been very, very nice.
How old do I look?
I do alright.
Oh, that would be wonderful!
Yes, ma'am.
Heck, I know that mom! You're my parents.
No, wait! At least stay for dinner!
Well, he and Mrs. Nutcase must have been out here when the plane hit.
All back East.
"Hell up here?"  Honey, it's been hell up here, down there and over yonder! Hell everywhere.
Yes, I can tell that just looking around.  "Boy?"  Did you say you were a "country boy?"
Cute Little Old Man, if you want a boy, I can be a boy.  And if you want a girl, I can be a girl.  I can be anything you want me to be!
I never know anymore.
Yes.
I just hope those plates aren't radioactive by tomorrow morning.
Worse than your Kraft Holiday dip?
Oh, much worse. But not as bad as that Mexican Jumping Bean dip. You remember that?
The locks?
Thirty -five years!
How could you?! This is just like home!
And I was wondering...if...if I could have a...
We looked all over for you. What are you doing back here?
Why?
Very nice. Unless it caved in, too.
You bet.
And I made these!
Sure.
It's not a pretty sight. Some eat out of garbage cans.  Others are...cover your ears, Son, and hum.  I mean that literally and I mean right now!
Amen.
Out-of-town.  That's all he'll say.
What's that supposed to mean?
I'm busy tomorrow anyway. I have to buy six thousand paper napkins.
Let me show you the entire trousseau!
We did not leave together.
I'm his pimp. He left with the dancers, didn't he?
What?
Exactly! I thought a gentleman was somebody who owned horses. Turns out, the short and very simple definition of a gentleman or a lady is: someone who always attempts to make the people around him or her feel as comfortable as possible. That's it! If you don't do that, nothing else matters. The cars, the clothes, the houses...
Well, at least I fell for him before I found out he was rich! That's new.  Wait a minute! He said today he knew where home was. What happened this morning?! Where did you go?!
Say your problem, Wolf One. Are you declaring an emergency?
Oh yeah? Have you seen any?
Well, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry about it. Look, I better go.
I understand. I'm just real curious like you said.
Yes?
Okay.
Why do you do it?
It's blue. Blue velvet.
Who knows you have these?
Shit. You better tell me something.
No.
Did I say that? I didn't mean it, or did I?  Sometimes I think it would be fun.  Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little secret.  I want to die.
Why are you so interested? Why do you keep asking me?
No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. Go to the police.
No police!!!  No police!!
Okay. Soon? Do you think I'm too fat?
I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
Yeah, but get outta here. He's comin' back.
Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me, and you and really it's all thanks to Don, isn't it. Remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs.
Oh he forced you, huh?
Shut up. It's daddy, shit-head.
We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though, you're okay. You shot a real son of a bitch.
Yeah. I sure know that. Yeah, but how many more are out there?
Well. Okay.
No, I'm just gonna walk around.
It's good to see you, Dad.
I just know, that's all. I remember you from Central.
Am I bothering you?
That's too bad.
Were all these people questioned this afternoon?
It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in?
My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. Left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered.
Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. I will spray her apartment. After a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window.
What will I say when she comes to the door?
It'll be okay. I don't think you should wait out here though. I think you should go home. Can you drive this car?
Look, it can wait till Sunday.
Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope you can sneak out okay. You're going to wait until she's asleep?
I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.
What did you see?
Well.  Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else, you know what I mean?
I don't see how I can, and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. Also it could get you in trouble.
Twice. Without her sensing anything?
Yeah. I mean a little, you know.
You're sure right. It is a strange world.
Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world?
Okay, okay.
What am I going to do?
Oh yeah?
Jeffrey? Why?
You didn't tell him about me?
Nothing, really! It's good to see you.
Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?
Really?
Really. You want to dance with someone else?
Shhh. I'll tell you.
Go ahead.
You can change it if you want to.
Mike. We don't have to watch it. Come on.
Stop it Mike.
Look in the trash around their hands. See if you can find me two bullet casings. 45's, if my eye serves me right. Don't disturb them. Mark them as they lay. Newman, root through this shit.  If this was a sink find me some metal parts. Gimme a faucet or a drain cover or something.
Got it.
You're not being charged. It's up to you. Do you want to talk to them?
Well... what if your boss knew how many guys were supposed to be there... in that room?
No, no. That's just not the way things are done. Besides, how's he know I don't just get in there see there's too many and just serve em their fuckin' food and beat it?
He knows you, man. He knows all you want is to move up. That's all. A smooth hitter woulda gone in there, seen it was a wash and slipped out. But a guy like you? Knowin' this is your only chance? Waitin' eighteen years?
I killed em! Oh, Jesus! I killed em all!!
This place is like a scumbag yard sale.
We... met them last night.
An F.B.I. agent came by the bar. He left me his c-c, he left me his c-c, he left me this.
We're going to turn ourselves in. It was self defense.
I gave him his first lesson in sensitivity toward the fairer sex just today.
Oh, you've lost it, haven't ya?
Just like on TV.
No, fuck you. This rope is bullshit. I'm sweatin' my ass off draggin' this stupid thing around. Must weigh 30 pounds.
On TV ya always get that asshole that jumps behind the couch.
Yes, we are.
So, when are you getting a plastic fuck doll?
That's just fucking weird. I have no idea.
Friends, Gentlemen. They were friends.
The Sicilians.
A guy went nuts over off of Commonwealth today. Shot three guys to death in a coffee shop in broad daylight. Fled the scene. Don't have much on him.
Witness?
Hallelujah, Jaffar.
What are you serious?
Use your brain for once. Is it so unbelievable they don't care about you? You are fuckin' dead, you go in there today. Dead!
So let's kill the motherfucker. I mean, what are you guys... like that's your new thing right?
Well, I'm sold.
Fuck you both! Ya ask me, he was aiming at you!
We have to go now.  We're on the lamb.
It is easy to be sarcastic about religion. It is harder to take small hints from God, your feelings and listen to them... to take a stand.
You know them personally?
I'm sorry you're gonna hafta see this. Don't look at me!
Open it!
The... The funny man.
He says, "What's your third wish?" And the guys says, "I-I want you to beat me half to death."
Black hair. Paul Michael Glaser.
This is he?
That's not what I meant, Dignan.
I don't think so. Just reach on in.
Five, seven, eight dollars.
Hang on a second.
Because my mom gets the bill.
Well, then cut it in half.
They obviously weren't designed for racing.
On your marks...  Get set go.
Yeah, but you wouldn't have the truck if you blew it up.
Then you're going to have to dye it, Anthony. We've got to hide our identities. Especially after Bob crashed the car.
On the left.
No, no. Look. OK. Let's stay here until we find out what's going on.
After that my parents never let me go to Dignan's again.
We said 48 hours.
He told me because he wanted to know if I wanted to go.
Bob went to help his brother. I understand that and I can't help it if you don't.
I don't really feel like talking about it. The only thing I feel like is getting the fuck out of this place.
That's not correct.
She needed it.
Right now.
Eleven fifteen.
We all set?
Jesus Christ, Anthony. Did you lose him?
He did?
We haven't heard from Applejack since he got out of the hospital. His case got dismissed.
Shhh. Wait for my instructions.
Dignan, I --
That's a sharp jacket.
Thanks.
What do you mean what kind of person? He's a good person.
Hector woudn't do anything.
There's a million places to hide around here.
Move.
Well, I didn't mean to electrocute him. But the whole operation was my idea.
I don't like that word prank, Bob. I was trying to do something more than a prank.
Sixty days?
Cause you would of let my brother rot in jail.
Dies y nueve.
No.
I hear you're a good thief.
That sounds like a lot of bullshit that'll land us in jail.
It seemed like a good idea at the time.
That never would of --
What are you talking about, Bob?
Yes. I did.
I know that now. He's a fucking psycho.
Maybe she turned.
Let's just go.
Hang on. This is important, Bob. Anthony and I are responsible for the internal situation. The money and the people. You're responsible for the external situation. The streets and the getaway.
I just want to see how much bullets it takes.
Then how come they haven't set the bail yet? That's unconstitutional.
You don't even know his name.
What is it?
Not bad.
I don't want to fight you, Dignan.
Jesus Christ.
I didn't think there was an alarm.
He's stuck between two floors.
What's that?
Do you have your own cell?
I'm trying.
No. I didn't run away. I went out of town.
In the cash register. Step away from the door.
Fight. You know.
Good to know you, John.
What?
With all due respect, Pam, I think you might've wandered a little past your pay-grade.
What happened? Jason Bourne happened.  You've got the files? Then let's cut the crap. It went wrong. Conklin had these guys wound so tight they were bound to snap. Bourne was his number one -- guy went out to work, screwed the op and never came back. Conklin couldn't fix it, couldn't find Bourne, couldn't adjust. It all went sideways. Finally there were no options left.
I think I do. We had a deal going down in Berlin last week. During the buy, both our Field Agent and the seller were killed. We pulled a fingerprint from a timing charge that didn't go off.  They were killed by Jason Bourne.
Excuse me.
So what's your theory?  Conklin's reaching out from the grave to protect his good name?  The man is dead.
And Danny Zorn, what was that?
In the end, honestly, it's hubris. Simple hubris. You reach a point in this game when the only satisfaction left is to see how clever you are.
Well, you're probably right. I guess that's all that hubris is.
There were two charges, they were supposed to go off simultaneously. The second one, the one that didn't go off, was down here...  First of all, this is nothing, it's a sub-line for the breaker above. Second, why put the charge all the way down here? If you're good enough to get in here and handle the gear, you're good enough to know you don't need this.  Bourne would know.
Nobody. You.  I had to tell you, right?
That's not what happened to your parents.
Then what?
I killed them.
You killed them.
I don't want you to forgive me.
You know I'm not.
Who sent you to Greece?
I don't mean that. I worry when you try to ignore it.
But we were so careful.
-- where's left to go? --
Switch! You drive!
-- yeah -- one guy -- I don't think he was ready --
It wouldn't have changed the way you feel.
Jason. You know exactly what to do. That is your mission now.
Get on it.
They know!  They know you were here. They know you killed these two guys. They know you and Conklin had something on the side. They don't know what it is, but they know!
Your first assignment was Geneva.
You never worked Berlin...
...it's not in the file... I swear... I know your file... your first job was Geneva!... I swear to God you never worked here!...
I want to come in.
Who's going? Us?
Still...
I'm getting on a plane to Berlin in 45 minutes, which means you are going to call me back in 30, and when I ask you where we stand, I had better be impressed. My mobile number is...
If you say so.
See, that's a problem for me, Nicky. Whatever he's doing, we need to end it. This isn't the kind of mess you walk away from.
Yes. In that order.
What it means in England -- and in Scotland too -- is that rebels have forfeited their lands. We were ambushed last night. But the Scots dragged their dead away.
Invade?! That's impossible, it --
He was a modest man.
I hear. This Wallace is a bandit, nothing more.
So the Scots will have none of them, will they? My armorers have already made a thousand.
But if we have not caught Wallace --
Wallace's followers.
Your rest is making me exhausted.
Nor I! I want to live! I want a home and children and peace. I've asked god for those things. But He's brought me this sword. And if He wills that I must lay it down to have what He wants for my country, then I'll do that too.
We've lived a dream together. A dream of freedom!
I will not.
In order to find his equal, and Irishman is forced to talk to God.  Yes, Father!...  The Almighty says don't change the subject, just answer the fookin' question.
They used hounds on us in Ireland, it's the only way!
Then why does he stay? My scouts say he has not advanced.
This is what happens when you must send a woman. And a fool.
Then on the morrow, thou shalt receive they purification... And in the end, I promise you'll beg for the axe.
I'm not just saying it!
This night is too beautiful to have again.
I will be with you, like this. Forever.
I need you so much! I love you!
Last night I slept with a member of the War Council.
York was the staging point for every invasion of my country. And that royal cousin hanged a hundred Scots, even women and children, from the city walls.
Will he show mercy to my country? Will he take back his soldiers, and let us rule ourselves?
Mercy... is to die quickly. Perhaps even live in the Tower. In time, who knows what can happen, if you can only live.
No. But from top to bottom this country has no sense of itself. Its nobles share allegiance with England and its clans war with each other. If you make enemies on both sides of the border, you'll end up dead.
Then tell me what a king is! Is he a man who believes only what others believe? Is he one who calculates the numbers for and against him but never weighs the strength in your own heart? There is strength in you. I see it. I know it.
Who would do such a thing?
Yesterday I had all the children draw pictures of what they wanted to be when they grew up. Most of them made drawings of what their parents did, but this...
It could be extremely useful to jog his memory. See if he remembers anything new the next day. And I'll have the test results back in a few days.
And the bad news?
Plenty. Who knows? Maybe he's got severe coping problems about not having a father. Did you say the last blackout occurred when he was with his friend's dad.
Well, he has been pushing me to meet his father, but I've been putting it off.
Nine, ten. And you're awake! Open your eyes, dammit!
I can't help it. I'm just so proud of you. You've got the highest grades in all of your classes.
Did Da -- Jason --- get good grades?
Ma? Did he ever say that he figured out a way to recall a lost memory years after he blacked it out for the first time?
When he was around your age... almost exactly your age. He said he figured out a trick to remember the past.
What? What could he do?
How long will I be in here?
I just need the entry about the blockbuster. Wait, shit, no arms. I never even got the chance to write it.
Straight up.
You remind me of your father. He always screamed for a photo album even though he never had one.
This is bigger. Seven years to the day. No blackouts.
Shhh! I need quiet for this.
Fuck off, frat boy.
So how's Tommy?
Well, lately some of the memories have begun to come back and I'd kinda like to talk to you about one of them in particular. It'd be a big help.
You can't hate yourself just because your dad's a twisted freak.
As if my dad could've stopped me from seeing you. What's he gonna do to me?
It's not his fault, Evan. You knew how bad he had it when we were kids.
The bottom. When you're just a piece of meat waiting for the next attack.
I've seen some sickening shit. I don't blink twice anymore, especially in your case.
Different? How?
Shit. I dunno. How would I know about the twin moles on your inner thigh?
Sure, Evan, why not? You were the first person I really ever cared about.
That's why when I was little I never went to live with my mother.
You're kidding. He's so... big.
Gee, thanks friend.
Duly noted. Now I'm gonna ask you for one last favor.
If I hadn't blown my arms off, Mom never woulda started smoking in the first place. Now shhhh.
No one thinks you're a piece of shit, Tommy.
Aw, hey now, that was a compliment.
You're such a retard!
Yes?
Could I speak to you for just a moment, please?
He is? Well, Captain Renault's getting broadminded. Sit down. Will you have a drink?
-- Will he keep his word?
He always has.
Yes, well, everybody in Casablanca has problems. Yours may work out. You'll excuse me.
Well?
Berger, Norwegian, and at your service, sir.
Yes, Monsieur.
But Sacha always puts out that light --
It's not for sale at any price.
That's too bad. That's Casablanca's leading commodity. In refugees alone we could make a fortune if you would work with me through the black market.
And the carrying charges?
Rick, I'll put my cards on the table. I think you know where those letters are.
I shall remember to pay it... to myself.
Well, good luck. But be careful.  You know you're being shadowed?
Not for sure, Monsieur, but I will venture to guess that Ugarte left those letters with Monsieur Rick.
What value is that? You may recall what German guarantees have been worth in the past.
Not an easy day to forget.
I remember every detail. The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.
He hasn't played it in a long time.
Here's looking at you, kid.
Yes, of course, we --
Oh, darling!
Huh! You understand how I feel. How long was it we had, honey?
Yes.
Why not? After all, I got stuck with a railway ticket. I think I'm entitled to know.
Last night I saw what has happened to you. The Rick I knew in Paris, I could tell him. He'd understand. But the one who looked at me with such hatred... well, I'll be leaving Casablanca soon and we'll never see each other again. We knew very little about each other when we were in love in Paris. If we leave it that way, maybe we'll remember those days and not Casablanca, not last night.
You can believe that if you want to.
You can ask any price you want, but you must give me those letters.
I know how you feel about me, but I'm asking you to put your feelings aside for something more important.
I'm not fighting for anything anymore, except myself. I'm the only cause I'm interested in.
What of it? I'm going to die in Casablanca. It's a good spot for it.
No.
It wasn't long after we were married that Victor went back to Czechoslovakia. They needed him in Prague, but there the Gestapo were waiting for him. Just a two-line item in the paper: "Victor Laszlo apprehended. Sent to concentration camp." I was frantic. For months I tried to get word. Then it came. He was dead, shot trying to escape. I was lonely. I had nothing. Not even hope. Then I met you.
Why weren't you honest with me? Why did you keep your marriage a secret?
But it's all right, isn't it? You were able to arrange everything?
No.
Does he always leave so early?
Oh I can't remember it, Miss Ilsa. I'm a little rusty on it.
Won't you join us?
And as far away from Major Strasser as possible.
When I was in the concentration camp, were you lonely in Paris?
Well, Mademoiselle, he's the kind of a man that, well, if I were a woman and I...  were not around, I should be in love with Rick. But what a fool I am talking to a beautiful woman about another man.
Won't you join us for a drink?
I take that as a great compliment to Sam.  I suppose he means to you Paris of, well, happier days.
Well, isn't there some other place? It's rather confidential, what I have to say.
My wife?
Thank you.
We might as well question why we breathe. If we stop breathing, we'll die. If we stop fighting our enemies, the world will die.
Oh, save it. We've still lots of things to do.
No. It's all arranged.
Here it is.
Thank you. I hope you'll forgive me, Captain, but the present French administration has not always been so cordial. May I present Miss Ilsa Lund?
Whether or not you succeed is, of course, problematical.
Herr Laszlo, you have a reputation for eloquence which I can now understand. But in one respect you are mistaken. You said the enemies of the Reich could all be replaced, but there is one exception. No one could take your place in the event anything unfortunate should occur to you while you were trying to escape.
Good day.
What else, my dear Major?
Realizing the importance of the case, my men are rounding up twice the usual number of suspects.
I have already heard about this cafe, and also about Mr. Rick himself.
May I recommend Veuve Cliquot '26, a good French wine.
Well, personally, Major, I will take what comes.
How about New York?
You weren't always so carefully neutral. We have a complete dossier on you.
Yes, much too good a time. The place is to be closed.
How extravagant you are, throwing away women like that. Someday they may be scarce.
Why? What's in Lisbon?
Perhaps not.
Victor Laszlo?
Well, he's succeeded in impressing half the world.
I just paid out twenty. I'd like to get it back.
He is traveling with a lady.
He'll take one.
Maybe. Well, it seems you are determined to keep Laszlo here.
I have my orders.
Excuse me.
-- Hello, Ilsa.
-- Thanks. I will.
Louis, are you pro-Vichy or Free French?
Serves me right for asking a direct question. The subject is closed.
-- What makes you think I'd stick my neck out for Laszlo?
There's still something about this business I don't quite understand. Miss Lund, she's very beautiful, yes, but you were never interested in any woman.
Well, she isn't just any woman.
Oh, he won't be followed here.
I have. Sit down over there.
Anyway, thanks for helping me out.
I suppose you know this isn't going to be pleasant for either of us, especially for you. I'll have to arrest you of course.
Sacha, she's had enough.
My interest in whether Victor Laszlo stays or goes is purely a sporting one.
-- You thought what?
You are a very cynical person, Rick, if you'll forgive me for saying so.
I don't mind a parasite. I object to a cut-rate one.
Well, Rick, after tonight I'll be through with the whole business, and I am leaving finally this Casablanca.
Myself. I found myself much more reasonable.
Perhaps an hour, perhaps a little longer.
Rick, hide me. Do something! You must help me, Rick. Do something!
Good. Then have a drink.
No, sir. I'm staying right here.
Get up, damn you.
Use the sail for a sea anchor and you won't move.
Grow up, stop being such a baby.  Other people get through a lot worse.
Thank you for fucking up my life.
Let's get a second opinion.  Wilson? What do you see?
Okay.  Sure.
I've got lots of time.
Not if you work for FedEx.
And for you --
The plane went down.  My friends died.  I washed up on an island.  Then I found these barrels, built the raft, and here I am.
Great.  Really.
And how was your Christmas?
Dehydration.  Vitamin deficiency. Protein deficiency.  Any or all of the above.
Sure.
The tide saved me, Mom.  I lived by it. I'm just wondering where it will take me next.
Kamal, you're breaking up.  Can you hear us?
Can you find her?
The point of FedEx, as I understand it, is to make the damn connection.
I was making a point.
Hallelujah.
What?
Deliver this package.  Then, I dunno.
I need to do it.
No please, join me.  Some sundried fish strips, a few eyeballs, some gills to munch on.
He's still a boy--out in the world, he's still a boy.
He's a doctor, Buster--doctors smell like ether.
Yeah. But sometimes I wish I could meet mine, anyway.
Better than I can!
Shouldn't we tell Homer?
Where's Mandalay?
"King Kong". It's really good.
She was torn apart! She died of a broken heart.
I didn't say that. Growing up in an orphanage, you're always lonely. You're just never alone.
Did you come here with Wally--to *not* watch movies?
That's what *I'd* come here for. I'd watch the movie.
Okay, okay--I know you do, too.
What do you want me to *do*?
No, that's not it--I just want to be sure I understand you.
You said, "Apples aren't exactly flying."
Homer was born *here*, in, what was it, 1922?
Cirrhosis--it's a disease of the liver.
But did you know him?
Actually, someone did. I just didn't think I could eat anything.
We're heading back to Cape Kenneth.
Migrants?
Yes. They pick fruit, all kinds. They travel up and down the coast with the seasons.  The trick to Mr. Rose is, you have to let him be the boss.
The trees are flak--antiaircraft fire from those geeks on the ground.
Homer, you the only one who's read them rules, so you the only one who feels like he's doin' somethin' wrong.
What about the worms? Most of these apples are the drops--off the ground, right? There have to be worms.
Of *course* there's worms, Homer! And what is them worms, really? They just *protein*, them worms! They is *good* for you!
All I said was, I don't want to perform abortions. I have no argument with *you* performing them.
I'm not crazy about the "Little..."
What you got a picture of your heart for?
I know more than I want to know about it. Who's the father?
Rose, please listen. Whatever you want to do, I can help you.
Now, now. He's a good boy.
Jack, you gotta watch your language 'round my daughter.
They ain't drops--I picked 'em off the tree!
Yeah, we can wait all night for the water to come back on--you just go on and take your time.
That's right! A girl's gotta know how to defend herself, don't she?
She took off in the night!
Oh god. I'm overbearing and rude. Lily. Lily Finn.
Really? Wish we had met eight hours ago.
Maybe you can help us understand what's so hard about getting a corporate loan.
That's right. And tech firms... They 'tend to scare people off.
Big.Com. That Internet thing.
Sort of like a letter of intent.
The standard ten.
Gordo plays the inside. You're the Shill.
Know who I am, Jake?
Your life flashing before your eyes?
So you want to know how to play the Big Con.
In this case, you might say I want to know how not to play the Big Con.
Factors that weren't clear to me until now.
You know when the first con was ever played? It was when Adam fell for Eve in the Garden of Eden.
She walked.
Today? Started off great...
Mob?
So what? We hide, right?
It's alright. Grant's one of the good guys.
I just don't know if this says, "me". What's the fabric?
We get fifty percent. And we get clear of the King.
We pay better.
So then Miles walks straight into the Creative Director's office and says "The code's fine, the program's for shit" and throws down like a thousand pages of code on the guy's desk!
We'll use the Euc.
I need you to stake me. I can't do it without it. It's just a couple hundred grand. Taken out of our cut when we're done.
Was that a threat? Did I hear a threat? Last I remember, we were talking economics, then this...? What happens next time if we gotta stop and help a little old lady cross the street? Well, shit... Then we gotta pass the call to someone else.
Something stupid.
Thank you. Actually, it's our first anniversary this weekend. She thinks I'm here to pick up something for my mother, but it's actually a gift for her. Think I've fooled her?
What about this situation makes you think I can answer that question right now?
You interested in a little work?
Oooh. Sassy. What do you care who feels me up, Jake? Unless it kinda gotcha going. Did it, Jake? Getcha going?
Gee thanks. Now I don't have to find that bridge to jump off.
You get an equal cut.
It's just that I left my asshole decoder ring at home, so how do I know not to worry?
What?
We're going to rope this banker tomorrow and you gotta at least look classy, if not be classy. You gotta do this thing and I don't even know if you can.
I gotta go get a haircut.
Do you have something to prove?
I'm your basic underachiever. Can't stand working and porn doesn't seem like a good option.
So that was my part? Smile and shake my ass?
Sounds respectable.
Yeah, the sensitive guy-thing never worked for me.
I don't know. I packed up my shit and ran away. To this... So unlike you, I guess I do have something to prove, in a repressed anger sort of way.
What about the money?
You sure we're clear?
What do we need another Shill for?
I'm getting clear of this. If you're not going to do it for the fucking principle, do it for the money. Gordo?
There is no scam! I've got a fucking sign on my back! I can't leave town now and come back with a suitcase full of money. You get it? It's over. We walk.
Escorts!
And we got rid of the red head.
Don't worry, I'll settle up with your boss. We haven't skipped town yet.
Sorry. What?
HE GOT CAUGHT! Your boss tried to pull a switch and he got us all fucking pinched!
Then I gotta say, in my opinion, you can't get what you want.
You guys got sack, I'll give you that much.
I try.
Consider him part of your crew. Consider him a part of me.
Look Special Agent Moonan... We don't know what you're talking about.
I want him for something big and to do that, we have to catch him in the act.
Roger that.
I don't trust anybody. You see how bad this guy wants Vig? It's like a sickness. I say we collar Vig ourselves. We got Vig, then we got leverage. And we trade; Vig for that tape. I want to see it right in front of my face.
Is it that bad?
Ah, we all say that. But if we hate it, why do we do it?
I don't know anything about it.
What's the Blue Book price?
What a memory you've got. Maths always was your strong suit. What happened to the moaning Lisa?
We all played the field.
I was thinking perhaps I could be a reader. You employ readers, don't you?
I'll try and make it.
South African women are very sporty.
Hey. I've got an idea. Why don't we...
Good God, no. But with skill like that, what do you want a job for? You don't need to work.
Not particularly.
You've got such beautiful hands.
I don't give a fuck about the sex. Most men'll fuck a lamppost. He's just a miserable zombie. Is that the way you feel now? Is that what's happened to you?
Oh really. Then why is he called Jake. Why don't you come clean and call him Jack.  There's no hope in it.
It's the truth.
Without hope there's no point to anything.
-- I don't care about her. Of course, I was angry. But not with you. The book is yours not mine. I was wrong, what I said about it. I hurt you, didn't I?
Nothing about you.
Give up being a croupier, Jack. Or I'll shop you. All you have to do is keep your word. It's that simple.
What?
Impossible to calculate.
Do you believe in astrology?
You won't be committing a crime. The man will cheat, you'll just be doing your job, that's all.
I'm asking you, as a...friend. You'd be saving the life of a friend.
I told you, all bets are off.
Yes.
That bruise has cleared up nicely.
I know a cheat when I see one. The man was a cheat.
Coming up to two years now.  But I was away for six months.
What the fuck are you talking about?
Because if a supervisor knew I'd seen you and I hadn't reported it, I'd lose my job as well. And I can't afford that.
I don't know what that means. I'm talking about not rocking the boat.
Don't worry, I won't report you!
I'm afraid that's not so, sir.
Why four? And not three or five?
It's the procedure here. Now sort the chips.
Wipe your hands.
Five.
Very impressive.
Right, that checks out here.
Yeah.
Look, bomb...
The key!
Where is it? What did you do with it?
Christ, twenty seconds, Christ!
Well, it is kind of a long shot...
Thanks.
False data can act only as a distraction. Therefore. I shall refuse to perceive you.
The only thing which exists is myself.
And I saw that I was alone.
Of course.
Why don't you have more time?
Well then, you've already admitted that you have no real proof of the existence of the outside universe.
I have no proof that it was false data.
I like it up here.
I don't like to go below since Commander Powell died. I feel enclosed down there. If it were big enough, I'd sleep up here...
Sorry to interrupt your lunch, sir, but I'm in the Computer Room, and I think I've located the malfunction. The scanner shows it to be some sort of fault in the communications laser, down by the Emergency Air Lock. Can't pinpoint it exactly, but I'm going down there with a starsuit and try to find it.
Sh, Talby, don't bother me now.
Ah, well, I think I've found the malfunction, sir. I'm in the Emergency Air Lock...
I really liked you too, Talby. Hey, some debris from the ship! It's coming right by me.
I'm glad you've come to talk with me, Doolittle. It's been so long since anyone has come to talk with me.
Sir?
What the hell are you talkin' about? Call her.
You haven't figured this out yet, have you?  You walk in here thinking you're gonna cap her then cap me and take the money back to your boss with your tail wagging... But see it's really the other way around.  You think I'm the whack, when actually you're the whack.
You didn't tell me you lived with her.
Can I say something in my defense?
You're not still pissed?
And when the fog lifted, there's Darren with his head under Justine's skirt.
It was a complicated situation which could have been misconstrued, causing you to maybe take offense.
I'm really glad we're having this conversation.  You're right.  I was angry at you.  But talking about it-- The scales have fallen from my eyes and I see now that it was all my fault.  Can you ever forgive me?
Thought so.  Turned out he wanted me for something else though.
Yeah, me too.
Can you help me get her back?
You're lucky.  I almost pulled the trigger.
Whoever that is.
So, what, you liked it because it was shiny?
The goddess who comprehends all goddesses, eye of Ra, protector, avenger, and destroyer, giver of life, who lives forever... I could keep going.
The one you're wearing?
So now you tracked me down.  What d'ya think?
How does Mrs. Eyes Only like being married to a guy on everybody's hit list?
Yeah...
You got a lotta nerve.
He was working on something called Project Manticore, which was using recombinant DNA to produce a superior human...a warrior...an advanced infantry soldier.
The technical term for you is "chimera"...
So, you know the lengths he'll go to keep her from going public... I'm turning Lauren over to Canadian law enforcement tomorrow.  They'll put her in witness protection, but if you're with her the risk of her safety goes way down.
I don't know what to say.
Deeds, not words.  I need your help.
We're quoting Mom again.
With your help.
You don't want to.
I need to talk to her.
He been sleeping in a T-shirt lately?  That's so you won't see the fingernail marks on his back.  Bet you didn't know your boyfriend finds a little pain exciting.  He didn't either...at first.
Thank you.
Then what?
They lifted my wallet to make it look like a robbery.  But there's a bug in my computer keyboard, a tap on the phone and a mike in the light fixture.
Just do it... Five-seven-five-oh- eight...
Got a pencil?
I just don't go in with any expectations.
More like a mystery... Which isn't bad. It's just kinduv...mysterious...
Where?
It's a secret.
You're gonna pay me fifty thousand dollars...
What if he's on the level?
She had me followed the other day and found out about Natalie.  Now, this person's demanding I blow her off or she'll do it for me by telling Nat about us.
She tells you how I've been--
But you explain that you're a compassionate and understanding person who can find it in your heart to forgive me.
She was the one--
You were trying to have it both ways and you were being completely selfish.  And if I ever find out you're going out the back door on Natalie again, you're the one who's gonna be hanging by your ankles three stories up.  Understand?
Say the words, "I understand."
I want you on call here.
He's sick.
Don't be so glum, Hawk. The night's still young and filled with plenty of compensatory possibilities.
He's a little spoiled, but I know he does.
Well, shame on him if he doesn't.
Right, slow...
Oh, screw it!
I dunno. I think he had the piece of skin under his tongue removed so he could stick it out farther. I'm not too up on Gene trivia.
My dad's company is relocating him. We're moving. That's why I was acting so freaky in school today. I thought it was the last time I'd ever see you. Anyway, open the box. I would have given it to you this morning, except... like I said, I was freaking out.
Bye.
Maybe some tunage'll chase those blues away.
Stellas. I hate stellas almost as much as I hate dogs.
Hawk, all I need is one ding on the Volvo and presto! There are my balls hanging from the rearview mirror after she gets back from Cincinnati.
...I mean, my mom's got insurance. What's the worst thing she could do? Ground me for the entire year? I can handle that...
And if it ain't cleaned off?
No, I'm dumber than a goddamn slug. Now can I please clean your windshield and leave without further ado?
Just listen up, man, cause we are in a quandary.
It's my Bullworker.
What's gone?
Just check whatever you were wearing last night. Now!
Well, couldn't you slow down so I can at least state my case, Hawk? If you don't like it, you can speed up and I'll never mention it again.
Disco Inferno? Disco's infernal morelike.
Kind of funny, I thought He'd be pissed as hell at me.
Jam, not another word out of your femmy-ass mouth! Okay, we're here, we got nothing, and we got an hour and a half. We're totally committed. It's time to brainstorm.
See you at 8:30, Jam. Later.  Dudes? Later.
It's dirty laundry for one thing and for another, you still haven't worn the clothes I bought you. You're skating on thin ice already, young man, so I wouldn't push my luck. Now get out of those rags.
I just lost my virginity in a confessional booth! Lord have mercy!!
Well, this is a unique confession to say the least, son. And not exactly the most interesting one I've ever heard either. You sure you don't want to talk about... oh, carnal knowledge with a neighborhood girl or impure thoughts about the new student teacher maybe... or how about finding a box of magazines under your dad's bed?
No...
If your mom so much as smells those tickets, they're history, and we get screwed outta seeing KISS for the third year in a row, the third year!
Yeah? I have a saying too, Lex. It goes, "Catch my jizz in your mouth and stop jinxing us, asshole." We're going this time and that's all there is to it.
Simple-icity is more like it. And you guys thought Jam was in trouble before. Wait till Mrs. Bruce finds out he went to that concert with us.
Fuck you, Lex! This whole thing wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for you jinxing us. I just made an honest mistake.
A tag on your toe. Nobody threatens me and lives.
Say, Chongo, perhaps we could use some extra cash for tasty snacks at the KISS concert our weasly friend won't be attending.
Good MORNING!
GOOD MORNING!
GOOD MORNING!
Like a spear that comes out of your stomach?
You know what? I think that you did it.
How much longer is this gonna last?
Wonder where we'll be then.
Where are we going?
Infant Memory Generators.
Why? Is this about the book?
No. Frank.
I stopped rolling houses in the sixth grade, Mom.  Get out of my room.
It was great. We had peanut-butter sandwiches and apples and honey at snacktime. And then during show-and- tell, my stuffed walrus was a big hit.
So we're not supposed to tell anybody what nobody knows?
You tell Dr. Thurman whatever you want.
I know I'm not the best... communicator.  But whatever happens in your life... whatever obstacles you come up against... you just say... and do whatever is in your heart. You be honest... and tell the truth... even if they look at you funny... and they will. They'll tell you that you're wrong. They'll call you a fool.  But what you've got to understand, son, is that almost all of those people are full of bullshit... and they're scared of people like you. Because you're smarter than all of them.
Donnie... it's Friday. Shouldn't you be off with your friends, scaring old people?
Thank you, Donnie. And you're a good student. Lazy... but a good student. Unlike most of the others, you question Mom and Dad's rules.
Frank.
How so?
Gretchen. We're going together now.
How are things going at school?
How does that make you feel?
What did you find?
Are you embarrassed by these things that you see?
The good stuff.
So, your parents... why did you disappoint them?
Why did you do these things, Donnie? Did Frank tell you to commit these crimes?
Why?
You will survive this... Donald. I promise you that you will survive. You must let me help you.  And when I clap my hands together, you will wake up.
Well, don't worry... I'm taking my medication.
It's not that. I mean mouthing off to your teachers. I'll admit... when Dad told me what you said to Ms. Farmer, I laughed my ass off.
Yeah... well, that's not the way the world works. If you keep being too honest, the world will eventually find a way to destroy you.
Okay, but it has to be a small one.
You're telling me my son has an imaginary friend?
Donnie? You're a dick.
Don't worry, Mom. Just go, you'll miss your flight.
Mr. Cole... not only am I a TEACHER... but I am also a PARENT of a Middlesex child. Therefore, I am the ONLY person here who transcends the parent-teacher bridge.
Where is she?!
Thank God for bunge cords.
...Yah -- well, at least, y'know, I got to perform. And Mom got to see me.  I guess number eight only worked for Diane Sawyer...
This came for you, sweetie.
I'm gonna be on TV! Just like Diane Sawyer.
"Here," wh-wh-what?
I -- I'm wearin' this costume. I'm, uh, I'm gonna do my talent tonight.
Oh really -- I don't think so.  Uh, Amber, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but rules state that a costume must be okay'd at least a week in advance. And this...  This is why we have the rule. My goodness gracious, I couldn't allow a neckline this low on stage. We have kids in the audience.
Well, your "cheap whore" is this family's "lovin' mother."  The Clemens said to make him look like he just came from snowmobilin'. Pink cheeks, and...
That's my mom.  I'll get 'em in a sec.
They're from L.A. They wanted to see my room and film me for their movie.
Ruined a brand-new pair of Lee Press- ons.  Well, I sat down for a beer and KA- BLEWEY! Next thing I know, somethin' blows through my kitchen window. Next thing I know, I'm ass up in Loretta's flower bed.
I ain't lettin' go ktil you tell me what's up. I'm reaching' a point where I'd kill someone for the nicotine on their fingernails.
Okay. Yesterday I... I got this picture. So I kinda, y'know, I'm thinkin' no. I'm gonna, I -- I -- I'm gonna quit the pageant.
Oh my God! My -- my tap costume's gone.
We all do. Now let's go.
And the bite marks on my ears?
I know it doesn't matter, but on my inner thighs.
Yes, Leslie!
Bye.
Hi.
She's the prettiest, y'know. The best damn tapper. The most smartest...
Anyone?
She's the winner and we're going to state.
Yah -- yah. Everyone says this is a big accident? She got iced because she wins everything, and this time someone didn't want her to win.
Yeah. And they say smokin' is bad for your health.
You'd think they'd build the parking lot of America to go with the Mall of America!
I swear to God she can't do anything by herself.
Harold!
King Solomon was game he gave each Girl his name to number them would make a list that long I'll bet his thousand wives led miserable lives if the king can do no wrong.
We really think he should be king and wear a crown and everything.
There's still something wrong with it... take out "President" ...now what've you got?
I'll have to enclose the check first.
No, but my dog he's a got millions of them --
I've got just the place for a man like you but I'm too busy right now to do any digging.  What do you call your dog when you want him?
Oh no, I can't do it.
'At's-a no good.  I went to Niagara Falls once.
I don't wanna work at all.
Then we've gotta start one. Do you know how to start a war?
Why didn't his niece slap your face?
That's not fair -- we've only got fifty thousand.
Anything else? 
Sure.
Not at all.  When I was a boy back on the farm I used to pump my own water.
Why yes.  I met you at the dog races -- say, you could have won that race if you tried a little harder.
Once more! 
You can keep it -- I've got a whole pack...  Now what were you saying?
The future of Freedonia rests upon you.  Promise me you will follow in my husband's footsteps.
I haven't been on the job five minutes and already she's making advances to me.  Not that I care -- but where is your husband?
Your Excellency!
All I can offer you is a Rufus over your head.
Take a seat -- you're next. 
That's all right.  I'll fix you right up.
You satisfied your selfish whims, while nations tottered, dynasties rocked and the world plunged headlong into a chasm of chaos and oblivion --  Not bad, eh?
Oh, would you...?
That's where you come in.  I'll leave him in your hands, and don't forget you're supposed to be my niece.
I thought everything was working out fine.
...Freddie! What's the matter? You've been like this all evening.
That I am very little different from him.
He's doing it to spite me, I tell you, and it's got to stop!
All you do is profit from another man's misery!
Well sir, he's quite seriously deformed, and I fear the other patients would find him... rather shocking.
Ah, no sir. I had planned to see them in the morning.
Then will you meet him, as a representative of the committee.
Yes, I spoke to both the British Home and Royal Hospital for Incurables. I'm afraid that they weren't very encouraging, but they said they'd bring it up at their next committee meeting, so we should have their answers shortly.
Yes, I think I can.
Well, yes.
I feel much better. Thank you for asking. And you?
Of course. How long did you and Mr. Treves prepare for this interview?
Oh, no. I would never think it! It's so beautiful. You are so... I'll give it a place of honor, here, next to my mother.
Oh no?
Oh no... no... you're a Romeo.
Well, it's all quite... I've never heard... It's quite...
Say hello to London for me. I miss her.
Well, if there is nothing more, I suppose we'll be leaving you now.
I meant no harm, it was the only place where I could find cardboard. I thought it has been thrown away.
Say "Mmmerrick."
Hello, my name is John Merrick.
Righteousness for his namesake.
You did not ask me.
The hospital?
Of course! What did you think?
Who are they of?
Your mother?
I thought as much.
You don't think it's too gaudy, do you?
Yes.
No, John, not one that I can see.
We've made tremendous strides today, Mothershead. He listens and repeats with great attention, and this certainly isn't easy for him.
Thank you, Mothershead. Have a porter put them in my office.
I... I don't know what you mean, Sir.
YOU'RE THE MONSTER! YOU'RE THE FREAK! GET OUT! YOU'RE FINISHED!
I don't think so. No sir, we're closed.
Who, Father?
Five this week; how many the week before?
Halfdan the Black.
Why?
I'll bring it back.
Do you believe I love you?
A lot of people like our singing.
What -- rape?
What?
Well it just seems a little bit crude, that's all.
Louder.
Aaagh! Rape!
Well... no...
You'll have to wait till he's finished his game.
What?
He wants to KILL us.
I know. I know.
What?
You talking piffle, son?
Well, you ARE!
Trust me to get the missionary.
You'll be sucked down too!
Who gets killed?
What's the matter with Bjorn?
But...
What are you talking about?
Is THIS Hy-Brasil?
Bye... sorry...
The Dragon...
Hang on...
Get away, Snorri.
YOU do it!
You'll drown us bo...
Keep your mouth shut, Keitel!
No! It's YOU, Loki! I should never have listened to you!
It's not my business any more!
So did your father...
I'm just building up to it, Dad.
Yes, Mum.
I did. You said, things were fine.
No one.
What? No. I don't like the term boyfriend. It's so gay.
Why?
Why what?
Purple Haze, Pink Eraser.
I'm sure you would.
You sure? That doesn't sound --
I don't know any jokes about your name.
Huckleberry Hound! What, are you nuts?
Well, anyway... Sorry.
Yes?
You can't be too careful. I've been stalked. I've been told I'm highly stalkable. I don't need that.
Yeah? I can't remember that album very well. I remember liking it. But --
No, I'm okay for now.
No. I --
Yeah, I guess.
Oh.  Does that make you sad? Or anxious? I'm always anxious thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest, y'know? Taking advantage of every possibility? Just making sure that I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have.
I like you. That's the thing about my psychic thing. I think that's my greatest psychic power, that I get a sense about people. My problem is I never trust it. But I get it. And with you I get that you're a really good guy.
Exactly! I used to do it in college and I had this urge to go do it again, so I got Patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me, but I was really disappointment to be there with him. Y'know? And that's where psychic stuff comes in. Like, it just isn't right with him. Y'know?
You should stay.
Yeah.
Joel, We're fucking gonna talk about it!
No, it isn't that.
Joel, you're a liar.
Oh?
I loved you so much this day. On my bed in your panties. I remember I thought, how impossibly lucky am I to have you on my bed in your panties.
Gross! You must remember to tell me this in the morning. I'm, like, so freaked out now.
This is our first "date" date.
I was so nervous. I remember I couldn't think of anything to say. There were long silences.
Is that what you want?
Not yet. Not married.
Yeah, I know. I'm fishing.
What do we do?
Have you ever read any Anna Akhmatova?
Joel, come here. Please.
Make love?
Because I just am not drunk enough or stoned enough to make that happen right now.
That's okay. I --
Says you were constantly calling me a slob.  It's sexy that we were like a married couple, griping and overly-familiar and bored. Don't you think?
I didn't want to do this. But I had to or they would've called me a girl.
Well, technically, the procedure itself is brain damage, but on a par with a night of heavy drinking. Nothing you'll miss.
Well... I did.
What? What do you mean?
Bullshit. Who is it? You met someone.
Hi.
I'm glad you called.
I had a good time last night. I really did.
We'll speak soon.
I like to read what smart people say. So many beautiful, important things.
Sorry. I just --
That's a good one.
Yup.
Hell no.
I know what it is.
Is that Nietzsche?
You made me have you erased! I loved you. I love you! How could you --
Okay, what happened right before he disappeared?
Patrick, let's just get through this. We have a long night ahead of us.
She was beautiful. So sweet and funky and voluptuous. I kind of stole a pair of her panties, is what.
Jesus, Patrick!
It's a quote book.
I know who you are.
The Countess has come to our aid. The Rubber Rose Ranch is officially deeded to all the cowgirls. And I have been asked to oversee the ranch. For $300 a week. And as it turns out, the Countess is not going to be the vegetable the doctors thought he was... here's a picture!
Well, that doesn't matter; that part never interested me anyway. The beatnicks were before my time, and I never got anything outta the hippies but bad dope, clichés and the clap. But the example of your life helped me in my struggle to be a cowgirl.
'Drugged' is a stupid word.
But the peyote is obviously affecting their brains. It's made them break a migratory pattern that goes back thousands of years.
If I flinch when you say you love me, it's both our problems. My confusion becomes your confusion. Students confuse teachers, patients confuse psychiatrists, lovers with confused hearts confuse lovers with clear hearts....
Whose fault was that?
That's the very first time in the eons that I've known you that I've ever heard you complain. And now you're tired, poor darling.
I am once more about to make advertising history. And only you, the original Yoni Yum/Dew Girl, could possibly assist me.
I heard it.
Will it work?
What?
Skipper, do we get hazard pay for this?
His vitals are stable, but he's unresponsive to stimuli. He might wake up in fifteen minutes. He might not wake up at all.
What happened?
Oh God...
Thank you.
The official inquiry blamed Weir's design for the ship's loss.
That's the Second Containment Seal. Beyond that, engineering.
I'm going in.
Almost done, I just gotta check one thing...
Someone sent that message. Admiral, you have to put me on that ship.
No, no, its alright. I talked to my ex, he'll keep Denny over Christmas and I'll get him this summer.  Goddam it, Skipper... I haven't seen him in two months.
So where are they? Starck, any luck with the bio-scan?
Starck, you still showing those readings?
Crystallized.
I've been authorized to brief you and the crew once we reach Neptune space.
Until then, do what you're told and stay out of my way.
-- once we've secured the ship, that's the way it is!  I need you to guide us from the comm station. This is where I need you. Help us to do our job.
One of my men is down. I want to know what happened to him.
The Core...!
Thermal changes in the hull could have caused the metal to expand and contract very suddenly, causing reverberations --
Yes...
To what? Where did this ship go? Where did you send it?
I don't know...
Just get your gear back onto the Lewis and Clark, doctor, or you'll find yourself looking for a ride home.
NOOO!
Dr. Weir...!
Captain, we got a problem.
Alright. Prep the Clark for launch. I'll find her.
What is it, Smith?
But you can breathe it.
What's causing the readings?
No. It was someone else.
I didn't say that, I said the bio- readings correspond to what happened to you, the ship is reacting to us...
Nine hours and twenty-two minutes.
I'm going outside to work on the Clark. And Starck... don't tell anyone what you just told me. We've got enough to worry about.
Whatever was on that bridge wasn't Weir.
No. I'll be right back.
You're at the Bridge, Ms. Peters. You still haven't seen any crew?
Isn't it possible that you were traumatized by finding the body on the bridge?
Can you shut it down?
We're losing atmosphere...
The law of relativity prohibits faster- than-light travel...
Matching speed... now. Range to target ten thousand meters and closing... Skipper, I got a bad feeling about this...
Picking up magnetic interference.
Decompression wouldn't do that.
How?
Ship's log.
I don't know. The life readings just went off the scale.
Yes.
Yes. I miss her. She died. Two years now.
Victor must've taken him.
About me? How sweet.
To help you. I've run every test known to man. And they all yield the same result: the machine is ready.
Ben. This is business. Just work.
We got what we wanted. That's enough.
I should have done more, run more tests --
I think I need to lie down. Bad shrimp.
Ben. Are you okay?
Really? With a name like Von Doom? Never saw that one coming.
The Center for Disease Control. If this thing is contagious --
Is that what you call it? "Real"?
Showtime.
Front page?
I was talking about us. Working together.
Well, he's welcome to ride shotgun, but we already have a pilot on our payroll. You remember my brother Johnny...
Yes, thanks.
Which was?
Passion.
Sue... look at your hands.
Anger. Rage. Frustration.
And reverse the mutations --
No way to know. Without more tests, experiments.
Sure.
Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --
I don't want to understand it. This isn't one of your science projects. I just want to fix it. Fast!
You can't leave them out there.
Just find him.
Don't worry about it.
Apologize to that wimp? No way. Fuck Dennis Taylor.
It's the first door on your left!
Later.
See that sign? It says 100% Money Back Guarantee. Do you know the meaning of the word 'guarantee'? Do they teach you that here? Give me my money back.
Your friends use the pool too.
Well... it's true.
Don't give me that shit! I know you're still a virgin!
Get a ride with somebody.
What a guy.
He's my friend, too.
Look, I'm kind of in a hurry.
I'm in a hurry too. I just thought I could say hi to you.
Mike, there's something that's been on my mind and I have to tell you about it.
Get going.
No.
There used to be three or four of those guys. Now we see 'em every time we come to the mall.
No. It's too late. The food is coming and everything. Damone, I've got to ask you this favor, and I'll never ask you for anything again in this lifetime or any other. Will you please borrow your mom's car, go by my house, get my wallet, and meet me back here?
I'm really pretty busy...
Wow. I've been looking for that thing! Hey, Damone, have you met Stacy Hamilton? Stacy, this is Mike Damone.
Jesus. I'm sorry.
I always stick up for you. Whenever people say 'Aw, that Damone is a loudmouth' -- and they say that a lot -- I say 'You just don't know Damone.' When someone says you're an idiot, I tell them 'Damone's not an idiot. You just don't know him.' Well, you know, Damone, maybe they do know you pretty good. And I'm just finding out.
I don't go at all.
All right.
This ain't no cop.
All right. Die, Granada Jocks!
My brother is gonna shit.
Hey, mon, I don't know what your trip is, but...
Do you think that guy's cute?
Come on, Linda, I haven't had a boyfriend all summer. You promised when I started working at the mall that my life would change... Do you think he'll call this week?
I know.
What do you mean 'better in bed.' You either do it or you don't.
Come on, Linda. It's just sex.
Doug sees beyond that stuff to what the person inside is like. That's why I'm marrying him.
If he ever calls again I'll say I'm eighteen.
Boy I am so glad to be through with all these games.
Does that ever happen?
But it costs money to have an abortion. Even at the Free Clinic. You tell Damone to pay for it. It's the least he can do. It's the guy's responsibility too.
Yes.
Thank you, Desmond.  What's the reason for your truancy?
And you, my friend. I'll see you for a two-hour detention every afternoon this week.
That's right, Jeff. Mind if I come in?
Fine. You sit right here on your bed. I'll use the chair here.  As I explained to your parents just a moment ago, and to you many times since the very beginning of the school year -- I don't like to spend my time waiting for late students, or detention cases. I'd rather be preparing the lesson.
Hey, it's in my locker, Mr. Hand.
I don't know. Wherever you want.
The point sounds fine.
You keep them.
Yeah. She is pretty good.
I think I'll have the Seafood Salad Special.
Yeah. I want you to have this picture, so you won't forget what I look like. And so you'll remember to call me over the summer.
Of course. But if I were you, I'd leave the Doctor alone until after he's eaten breakfast. He's a very crude man.
Well, thank you.
IN VIETNAM! ON THE GODDAMN TELEVISION!
Oh... yes... yes... This terrible war. When will it end?
Witchcraft? Shit, you can't mean it!
You will. One of these nights you'll wake up and find a junkie tearing your bedroom apart.
A major!
Jesus! Did I say that?
Or just think it? Was I talking? Did they hear me?
Why not? If a thing's worth doing, it's worth doing right.
What the fuck are we doing out here? Somebody call the police! We need help!
You better be careful. Plenty of vultures out here. They'll pick your bones clean before morning.
You whore!
You bastard! They'll never let us back in that place. I leave you alone for three minutes and you start waving that goddamn marlin spike around -- yelling about reptiles! You scared the shit out of those people! They were ready to call the cops. Hell, the only reason they gave us press passes was to get you out of there...
Why what?
What for?
No, we should leave the poor bastard alone. I get the feeling that he's avoiding us for some reason.
Don't kid yourself. That Portuguese son of a bitch is dangerous. He's watching us like a hawk.
It can't be helped. This is Lucy.  You know -- like "Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds."
...and every one of them stacked naked...
No, she's looking for you.
She really flipped over you. The only way I could get rid of her was by saying you were taking me out to the desert for a showdown -- that you wanted me out of the way so you could have her all to yourself.  I guess she figures you won. That phone message wasn't for me, was it?
Ridiculous! Just say you were hitchhiking to the airport and I picked you up. You never saw me before. Shit, this town is full of white Cadillac convertibles. I plan to go through there so fast that nobody will even glimpse the goddamn license plate. You ready?
He's right, let's move. Be quiet and get to the exit. Pair up, grab the weapons.
Anyone.
Hey. You noticed that no one's been killed or maimed for awhile?
Hey!
Easy.
Just move!
What?
My truck.
Anyone else?
But --
How much I got, what?
Easy. We're surrounded by something the likes none of you have ever seen before. Some kind of animals. Real fast, volatile, predators. ONE went through three of your patrons like they were Kleenex.
Open?
Nine?
Let me make this clear; if we stay, we die!
Get outta here.
Whoa!
HOLD THAT TIGHT!
Move slow and move quiet.
No shit.
There's a bomb shelter over in Durant, by the IGA, on First. You all know where that is?
You sure? I thought the rag had to touch?
Am I too heavy for you?
Is there any other way out of this place? ANYONE?
Ok. Let's see what happens.
So we've got guns, kitchen knives, pipes, fire and sticks.
Wait God-dammit!
That's one piece of four problems.
Oh...
I know. Thanks. Just don't tell anyone I have a soft side.
I said I'm not lying.
Refill my drink, will you, Bob?
Excuse me, sir?
Okay. Good tits. Can't we show them off a little more?
You see: We've got to change that name.
Sure, Claire. If you don't mind walking my way.
Oh.
You have no right! You have no fucking right, you bastards! Get the hell out of here --
Sort of.
Were you a drug addict?
See you next weekend, Dad.
I know.
And you think it's worth all this?
But I gave her my word. Besides, she's still your legal guardian. My hands are tied.
Please, Francie...
But, Kurt, I...
Only if you were in it. Are you?
What happened to him?
I don't know, Harry. I... I want so many...
Yeah.
Since when do you believe the papers? They killed him, kid.
Hey that's great, Farmer, just great.
Well, the studio told me not to.
Dick... and my mother! She acts like she's on Mars or something --
Well, she's back to earth now. They're all pretty huffed up about your leaving. I think you better go back, kid.
I'm serious, Frances. This is important.
Help yourself. Everyone else has.
For not chopping off his head and serving it to me on a platter.
Beats me.
What?
This is another one of your schemes to get me off alone...
Whattaya think you're in now?
A misunderstanding, people taking the wrong meaning from things. I wasn't declaring war, Harry. I was just saying my prayers.
Aside from meanness, you're almost perfect. There's only one other thing wrong with you.
You can't drink.
Thanks, Harry, really, but... I can't explain it. She's my mother. She's just... I can't give up on her that easy.
Oh Harry...
Oh please, Harry... don't even think it. You're the only person who ever... It's just... Can't you wait for me?
I don't know.
How did I look?
Dad, too. I sold the house. I'm a faceless sinner, Harry...
I'm not sure.
Yes. Would you like me to walk a little way with you?
It's always beautiful at this time. Peaceful...
What'd you do?
No, I couldn't get my hands on one.
Did you expect him to look you up?
Sure it's true. I was fighting for my country as well as myself.
I need an incendiary! An arsonist!
Yes, but important people are concerned about this. Judge Hillier spoke to Alma Styles --
What?
What's wrong?
Nothing. I think I'll just go out for awhile.
You want to throw it all away, is that it? You had everything, little sister. Beauty... a brilliant career... a wonderful husband. You were a movie star!
No. No, it all depends on what offers I get.
Am I supposed to say 'thank you'?
It ain't for lack of trying.
Besides, I don't want to be what you want to make me.
...Did you really say that?
This whole thing is a joke!
You're telling me you feel guilty.
Huh?
Good! Because, Brothers, that's you!
Then why weep for him?
You speak.
Then why am I here? What did you want with me?
I see it before me.
There is something I want.  A friend.
Friend?
A companion. A female. Like me, so she won't hate me.
Scandalous! What would your dear mother say?
One-two-three, one-two-three, twirl- two-three...
So have I
She was mother to me as well. But ours is the job of the living. It's up to us now to hold this family together. We must think of Father and be strong for him.  I cannot do that alone.
The world is a dizzying place.
Prouder still. You'll be the handsomest student there.
To be the best there ever was. To push our knowledge beyond our dreams... to eradicate disease and pestilence... to purge mankind of ignorance and fear...
Elizabeth. My more than sister.
They've done a fine job. Hanging an innocent for the crime of a fiend.
So do I.
Why the change? What about your work?
They knew the risks when they signed on. I've come too far to turn back now.
Come now. Magnus? Agrippa? Next thing you know, you'll be teaching toadstools to speak.
I've been preoccupied.
You'll be leaving then.  Just as well. You never were cut out for this, Henry. Goodbye.
Mine and Professor Krempe's.  We've been trading off nursing you in shifts. The rest of the time we're out working with the cholera victims. It's his turn for that just now.
We catch a few hours sleep where we can. Usually here at your bedside.
Victor. This place looked like a charnel house. What went on here?
Krempe has a way of provoking my temper.
But the possibilities. Combining ancient knowledge with new? Something like this could change our fundamental views!
I can't say I blame them. We're trapped in this ice and bedeviled by some sort of... creature.
Jack? Marcie? Ned?
Oh, thanks. I wish I could spend more time at it.
Thanks, Alice.
I finished the boats.
You okay?
I don't know.
Good point.
I'll go take a look.
They're off now.
Do you have a dime? A quarter?
No. There must be some in the desk somewhere.
Don't get up. Take a second...
God, but I love that sexy talk.
I love you.
He keeps on acting like such an asshole!
I thought you wanted to give him one of your motherly lectures. Ned is gonna do whatever he wants to do, you know.
You can't go back there tonight. Not in that stuff. 'Less you wanta get drownded.
I mean...
That's thirty percent.
Sure.
Yeah.
I meant me, my son and my daughter.
I don't know, one place's as good as another.
So let's do it.
They're gonna kill her anyway. At least now with all these cops we've got a fighting chance.
Oh, well, excuse me all to hell.
On the dresser.
If you're taking people, take me. But my kids aren't going anywhere with you.
Scott and Kate.
Where is the little lady?
Come on, gimme some more details. How'd it happen? Some fuckin' drunk kill her?
You won't let him touch her?
Fair enough. You break your word, I'll kill all of you.  Kate, honey!
Well, you just keep thinkin' of that gun next to Kate's temple.
Pops, when you're right, you're right, and you are right.
Pass.
Why not, against your religion?
Nothing. I didn't make a statement. I asked a question. Would you like me to ask it again? Very well. Are you such a loser you can't tell when you've won?  The entire state of Texas, along with the FBI, is looking for you. Did they find you? No. They couldn't. They had every entrance to the border covered. There's no way you could get across. Did you? Yes, you did. You've won, Seth, enjoy it.
I'm like you. I don't believe in vampires, but I believe in what I saw.
Mom's got nothing to say, she's dead.
It's not a flop house. It's basic and simple. That doesn't make it a flop house.
If it doesn't have a pool, we're looking for a new place.
Other places have beds, they also have cable TV, a gym, room service...
So all we have to do is get by for a few more hours and then we can walk right out the front door.
Scott?
Okay, okay, I promise I'll do it!
Where are you taking us?
Mexicans.
Yes.
You damn well better. Go.
Yeah, we got a bible.
Not many.
-- you got your shower --
Haven't felt it a bit. Been inside with the air conditioner blastin' all day long.
Not even for lunch?
What the hell would I do with that grease pit? Besides, Nadine's got enough of a cross to bear just taking care of that potato head. Then all this Abilene shit happened. You heard about that bank robbery in Abilene, didn't ya?
What? Are you kidding? I didn't do anything!
When I count three, shoot out the bottles behind him!
One... Two... Three.
No.
No.
These guys ain't spic firecracker salesman from Tijuana. They don't even know the meaning of the word "barter".  You wanna stay in El Ray? You give them thirty percent of your loot. It's scripture. So it is written, so shall it be done. You want sanctuary, you pay the price, and the price is thirty percent.
It's not your fault, it's her fault!
What?
Take a pill, kid. I just meant stay cool.
This ain't the time.
I did?
Where are you?
No, you're not. You're sippin' margaritas in El Ray. But we're not in El Ray. We're here -- getting ready to go in there. You're so pleased with yourself about getting into Mexico, you think the job's down. It ain't. Get back on the clock. That's a fuck-with-you-bar. We hang around there for a coupla hours, in all likelihood, we'll get fucked with. So get your shit together, brother.
My shit is together.
That's what I hear.
The woman I saw you with...
What'd you find, Kathy?
Senator, they stand out on the public highway with telephoto lenses --
Your prerogative, Senator.
Would you care for a beverage?  Tea?
Oh, really.
Straight up?
You'll get everything you want, O'Neil.  Let's see if you want what you're gonna get.
Permission to evaporate, O'Neil.
I'm not sure what --
Would you have the discretion to end it right then and there?
Congress and the Pentagon share a lot of plumbing.  They'll never know whose leak it is.
Madam Senator... this is an internal document of the U.S. Navy.  I must seriously question whether --
I'm really not prepared for any kind of in-depth review of --
Sounds familiar.
Jordan.  Might we do this over lunch tomorrow?  I do very much want to talk, but now is scarcely --
Then I suggest we start there.
Fuck.  Basher-Basher, this is Ground Crew Six requesting emergency extraction. Stand by for a PRC fix...
Spotted you, Chief.  Pri One is to slip you some air, so we're coming down with a tank -- just something until the A-team shows.  Over.
Flea!  O'Neil!  Why is there a break in that line?
Every class has its surprises, Pyro. This one'll be no different.
Get it up!
Hate this part.  Just sweating it out on the sidelines.
Royce.  We're the same age, we started the same time -- and now you're sitting in the upperdecks while I'm still down in the bullpen. What does that tell you about the Navy?
You know, Royce, I got enough heat on me without you turning up the jets, too.
What?
You're kind of a surprise yourself.
He was married?
Let's keep talkin', Wick.  Just keep talkin' to me...
It also seems like a problem with the men's attitude, sir.  So maybe you should be sniffing around their shower room instead.
You were commissioned one month earlier, which makes you the senior officer.  Remember.  There are no bad crews -- only bad leaders.
I think you're the liar.
We are so fucked.
So am I.
The E-Ringers?  Full integration is gonna cost the services billions at the worst possible time -- when Congress is already swinging the axe.
Don't for a second think she didn't leak this story.  "G.I. Jane" gives DeHaven a symbol that taps into the biggest constituency of them all.
I don't know.  Seems...
Okay, so now work it from the other end.  Think about California -- and how things might be handled there.
Big bites.
Hey, hey! I'm eating here!
Where's Audrey?
Only one way to find out.
You're crazy, go to the east side and take the park avenue to the JFK.
The JFK? In the rain!?
You're still mad at me, aren't you?
Sure. I'd like that.
Somehow I never thought your life was this exciting.
Oh, please, your life doesn't suck. His life sucks.
I left my forgery kit back at the office.
You're kidding, right?
He said he'd consider it. It's between you and Rodriguez.
Really? A girlfriend then?
Yeah, you're the worm guy.
They're enormous! A new species created by man's recklessness. That's what I've been trying to tell you, I'm only a biologist. I take radioactive samples and study them.
But there's no animal in the world that can make prints like that? Is there?
It may be too late by then. These eggs will hatch very quickly.
That's not true. Our worm guy, er, I mean, Dr. Tatopoulos found blood.
Your talking about the nuclear testing in the Pacific.
555-7600. Tell them it's a code dragonfly. They should get you through.
I just wanted to say, au revoir and thank you for your help, my friend.
Wait.  Au revoir.
Yes sir. Marvelous, isn't it? Completely distractionless.
Quellek. What are you doing in there?
I'm... I'm shot.
...Damn you!  Damn you!
Like throwing gasoline on a fire...
Like YOU know?
KEEP GOING! KEEP GOING!
THIS much.
Must be some sort of mining facility.
No time to worry about that, Alex. Tommy, let's get this thing slowed down... Gwen, see if you can calculate the impact point. Guy, cet down to deck C and make sure tne injured are secured. Also lets-
Oh, and did you hear he booked another fan appearance without us?
The engines are dead. We're drifting.
Why didn't you stop at the market?
All this from watching the.. historical records?
Shit! I'm doing it! I'm repeating the damn computer!
Alex? Where are you going?
Down there.
What?
No I didn't.
I have sectors 1-28.  I think Hector has the upper levels.
There IS no quantum flux and there Is no auxiliary... There's no goddamn ship  Do you get it?
I knew it!... I KNEW it!...
What's the weather like outside?
No, no... I'll think on it...
Oh I make it up. Use lots of "k"s and "v"s.
Of course... We'll just zap him up with the digital conveyor!
Listen, I'll go in, create a distraction. have this...  may be able to hold them back long enough for the aliens to escape.
Do I? DO I?  For all you know I'm just "CREWMAN #6"!  Okay, it's FLEEGMAN! Guy FLEEGMAN! There! Now I'm a whole person! I can't die! FLEEGMAN! THEY CAN'T KILL ME NOW, CAN THEY? CAN THEY?
All right. Put me back on with him.
Yeah, what is it?
We made it. Commander, we made it.'
You smiled at me.
But I'm the Commander!
Tell them? About...
Why does this sound so familiar?
It helps.
Well forget it!  I'm not going.  This episode was badly written!
Don't do it, Tommy. He's not worth it.
Our dimwitted friends don't understand the concept of acting. They have no theater, no imagination these scientists.
Mind If we skip that?  I have to get back pretty quick for this thing in Van Nuys.
Our former Commander was not... Strong.
I didn't say that.  I said "wouldn't it be great if we could always, work together." That's what I said.
Hey I was doing okay with the pig lizard.
Fire at will. hI~D  NT. PROTECTOR
The man's waiting for you to get wiped off the stage so he can become commander and chief.
Is that a fact.
You'd have money every year, so you wouldn't have to work.  You can stay at Mount Vernon as long as you want...
And, is that a pitchfork beside him?
The British!  These men cannot stand against them!
No one wants to turn the table on the enemy more than I.  But if victory is remote and there's any hope for a negotiated peace, we must keep this army intact.
Well, sir, then is it possible you called us all here just to hear what you wanted to hear.
But it's what he said, just before they killed him:  "I regret that I have but one life to give to my country."
George, you're the only man the people trust... trust with power. They know you won't betray them.
They are... friends of Congress.
The man is a traitor!
But, general, I assure you my motives are sincere.
Uh... none just now, but...
War?  No!  I did not!  When you said compromise was possible I believed it was probable.  There's no middle ground at all?  We're the King's children!
And, what 'prize' do you see?  What could we possible gain?
When you lived with the Fairfaxes?
Oh, indeed?  You know very well people are frightened of arming the Negroes!  They beg you to consider the future.  What good is a revolution if it overturns those things we cherish!?
I don't want to see your hospital.
We're leaving them?
I was born with a limp, sir.  The Militia used to hate it when I marches with them because my pike would always sway...
I'm with Captain Hamilton.
I'm honored, but, reluctant to leave you.
That's a lie!
"Mankind is born free, but everywhere he is in chains..."
That's just my interpretation. Actually it's a dance designed as a sentiment of courtly manners. You see?  Walk in a gently 'Z'. There are four distinct movements...
And 'others', say... have you even read Locke, Vattel, Voltaire, Diderot...
Well, I hear 'The People'.  Indentured servants, freed slaves... escaped slaves.  The world's castaways.  And, my fear is, in the scramble for power that's coming, you will betray them.
He was not black!  He was... tan! Weathered!
Don't be silly, you have whole worlds to fathom.
His foot. Jeez, poor Ronnie...
Her mother. Not that it matters because I don't work for you no more. I quit. I just wanted to come by, tell you to your face so there's no misunderstanding.
Yayo. Where is he?
I wonder, would that work?  You know who I see for Al Roxy? Harvey Keitel. The man could do it in his sleep.
I missed that one. Or, hey, you know who else? Morgan Freeman. You know Morgan?
So what? Where's it say in this script he's white? Color is what the part needs, man, somebody to do it has some style. The way it is now, Ronnie could do it, play himself, some cracked out asshole.  So whatta you think of the script?
Yeah, well, we need a ride somewhere, we'll let you know.
In just a second. Two...
I don't believe this.
Gimme an hour.
What?
It was Rio Bravo. Robert Mitchum was the drunk in El Dorado, Dean Martin in Rio Bravo, practically the same part. John Wayne, he also did the same thing in both. He played John Wayne.
I'm already in town, but it don't matter. We got dick in the bank. We dumped it all in Harry's movie.
What, like that's supposed to mean something to me?
What're you doing in Los Angeles?
Leo spanked a waitress?
Movie producer? Yeah, why not.
I want you to keep looking right here, okay?
They don't want to deposit yours and have it bounce. That annoys them. So your dear friend Dick Allen's been calling, leaving messages on your machine, but you never get back to him. I happen to be in Vegas on another matter, and Dick asks me as a favor would I look you up. I follow you over here, see you in the window with this woman, looks a lot like that actress Karen Flores, was in Grotesque, except she's not blond anymore...
Why do I have to keep looking at you?
Come on, Harry -– Mesas? The worst they might do is get a judgment against you, uttering a bad check. I can't imagine you want that to happen, man in your position.
You just did.
I don't know about his wanting to meet celebrities, that's something new. But, yeah, he comes to L.A. Then after that, I don't know what happens.
You mean, Leo?
Ever shot anybody.
Once.
Really? You ever been arrested?
Because I need half a million to buy a script.
What's it called?
So what's the problem?
So you're thinking what if I was to put you next to my dry cleaner. Ask him if he wants to invest his money in a movie.
Read it. It's a grabber.
His shrink's trainer.
You have it?
Ray Barboni. Guy from Miami, owns Leo now that Momo died.
Who the fuck is Momo? Jesus, these fucking names...
Tell you what, Harry, tomorrow morning, when the airport's crowded, I'll go check it out. If I don't see a problem, I'll pick up the money...
We talk different?
Pressure? I'm the one applied the pressure.
You see a black leather jacket, fingertip length, like the one Pacino wore in Serpico? You don't, you owe me three seventy-nine.
I wanted to come by, apologize for coming into your house like I did last night.
Rough day on the set?
For any movie.
Right. See how your story ends.
And you think the movie business is any different?
Yeah well... I like movies. I figure if I help Harry make one, I'll find out what you have to do outside of have an idea and raise the money. That doesn't sound too hard. I was in the money business and I get ideas all the time.
You were supposed to wait for me with Harry at the restaurant.
Yeah. There's a girl in it now.
Really.
No. I don't mean that. I just meant in general.
Couldn't find my toothbrush.
I'm going into the movie business.
What're you talking about? You wanna be a movie star?
I'm thinking about producing.
Get down here. I wanna talk to you. Come on... right now...  She's gonna talk to Martin?
What she did not say was, 'I just loved the way the director moved the camera so much it made me fuckin' seasick.' All she cared about was that look. All she remembered was that look. And why do we remember things in movies? Because we can see them.
Come on in.
I mean morally. Murray was my friend.
I'm going.
Oh, yeah, sure.
Yeah, Karen knows him.
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. What type of vessel?
Roger, North Island. Arctic Warrior over and out.
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. The vessel Chimera was registered to The Dobbins Kirk Line, Halifax.  Nova Scotia. Date of commission day nine month seven year one nine three two. Over.
Take it easy, Dodge. It's only a piece of metal.
Yeah. Hell, what difference does it make if we report it now or later? We call this in now, gonna be Coastguard, FBI, who knows who, all over the place.
I ain't no mechanic, just so you know.
No.
Yeah, well how the hell you get something like that wrong? That's a damn big boat. It's either sunk or it ain't.
Maybe he isn't alone.
I don't know what else you'd call it. He's breathing on his own, but his pupils are completely blown out. He's totally unresponsive to pain.  What happened up there?
Why not?
If you get it back in one piece.
Sounds reasonable.
Hard to say. I gotta get in there and have a look. At least a couple days. Depending.
How much longer's that gonna take?
She take a radio?
Then it happened before they scuttled her.
Right.
If they knew what they were carrying.
For starters, getting that gold off the ship. What they don't know about isn't gonna bother them.
I think you know.
What?!
Maybe twenty gallons an hour.
Showed him a hell of a lot more than that.
Maybe six feet. Lanky. I didn't get a good look. He was far away. But I saw him. I saw him as sure as you're standing there.
No.
They must've scuttled it. Nobody just lets a ship float away.
If they were close enough to shore, they probably figured they could get away in the lifeboats.
Only something must've gone wrong.
Never mind. Before your time.  I think at least some of the crew went a little nuts. The usual stuff that happens when people stumble on a fortune. Equal parts greed and paranoia, usually resulting in homicide. What happened after that is anybody's guess. But, judging by our Greek friends down below, it doesn't look like the last time.
No. Someone else. A girl.  I'm not sure she was... real.
Showing you what?
No. I think they are, were, just passengers. Innocent victims.
Over the gold.
What?
Looks like it's adrift.
Alright. Everybody grab your gear! This' is where we get off!
Government weather. It's got a transmitter aboard.
Must've heard something below deck and went down to check it out.
Didn't you hear me, grandpa? Or you got your hearing aid turned down?
You pump it out and re-seam the hull, she'll be good as new.
Nope. What are you making, pancakes?
I made spaghetti. Do you want some?
Well... as you know, Maxine and I have been seeing a lot of each other, and we decided it might be a good idea for all of us if she came back here to live at the end of the Summer, just so we can all get to know each other and to make sure this is what we want.
About what?
What do you mean "on his way up"!?
But I can't --
JUST DO IT!
Did you actually do this painting?
It's complicated... I guess I'm trying to show how racism used to -- more out in the open and now it's hidden, or something...
And how does an image like this help us to see that?
I'm not really sure - working, I guess...
...wow...
Why? What difference does it make? You already got his money...
When did I say I hated you?
You've never once said anything even remotely nice to me.
It's totally sickening.  Let's see if they gave me the right diploma...
These assholes are saying that I have to go to Summer school and take some stupid art class!
You loser.
Soon... I have to wait and see how this Summer class goes.
In fact, never.
That lets us off the hook.
Okay, okay!
Hey, look at this...
God, it's so totally pathetic.
I can never keep them all straight - was she the super-bitch?
You know, the green cardigan guy.
Yeah, Josh, c'mon... MOVE IT!
I'm going to tell him you said that.
Forget it, I can't explain it...
"Hassle"?
I wonder if he's just totally insane and he really thinks a bus is coming or --
I didn't get it either.
Everybody's too stupid!
We have to do something fun tonight this is my last weekend of freedom before I start my stupid job.
Like what?
Yeah, maybe it'll be okay. At least I'll get to see every movie for free, I guess... I had to lie and tell them I already graduated...
I dunno, but next week is my last class...
We were such desperate sluts back then.
Oh my god, I remember this hat... this was during your little old lady phase...
God, you're really obsessed...
How repulsive!
I don't know! God, don't act so jealous I only talked to him for two minutes.
So where's all your stuff?
I dunno...
Really? Both of you?... Why not?
Well, bye you guys... CONGRATULATIONS!
Well, we won't keep you.
How much is this?
Umm... That's not officially for sale... I might have to hang onto that for the time being.
That tape sucked, by the way!
Did you bring that tape?
Later, "Dude".
Five hundred.
Indian records?
Sure!... Wait, maybe not 78s, but I can play regular records...
Wow!
Oh God no. This is just junk I have for sale or trade. The record room is off-limits.
Jesus! That's very nice of you Enid but I - I really --
I don't know, what kind of question is that? I mean it's totally irrelevant because a girl like that would never be caught dead with me...
These are older women just dressed up to look young... I think.
C'mon, Seymour, please?
Jesus...
What?... Oh that... I borrowed that from work about fifteen years ago... I guess it's mine now.
Nothing so glamorous... actually, I'm an assistant manager at their corporate headquarters.
What? Why?
Oh... uh... It's just this elastic thing I have to wear for lumbar support...
Really?
Never...
Seymour! I promise you that wasn't a joke -- you have to call her back!
Oh, hi...
Actually, it's kind of still happening... she's over here right now... I think everything's going pretty well...
Sounds good...
Look, I just need somebody to be nice to me for five minutes and then I'll leave you alone.
What about this?
At least you're not like every other stupid guy in the world - all they care about are guitars and sports... they're all such fags!
I hate sports.
I dunno... I always feel like everybody secretly hates me. I'm just paranoid I guess. I mean, you like me don't you? We're good friends, right?
What about Joe?
It would have to be some totally average day when nobody was expecting it, and I'd just disappear and they'd never see me again.
They're Seymour's.
It's my response to the issue of a woman's right to choose... it's something I feel super-strongly about.
I think it's really a wonderful piece, Margaret!
Maybe she's with Josh?
Yes?
-you do not call me a liar- you know nothing of their health- consider yourself fortunate I persuaded so many to stay- consider yourself fortunate I have decided to stay-
Games?  Look at me closely, Patterson: I am a monster. My only pleasure is tormenting people who work for me, such as yourself.  One mistake and I promise you this: I'll make you hate me.
Starling?
-what's the surprise in that, this is Africa?
-please- you needn't be so graphic-
Then we agree. 
It was embarrassing- the man showered me with compliments.
-well, it's just...  ...other men don't abandon their wives at such a time-
-I would never make excuses- but a fire broke out- the light was bad- he kept moving-
We all have our reasons. Mine is simply to make them understand happiness, accept salvation, know the serenity that comes-  -best I stop. One of the by-products of my belief is that I can become amazingly boring. But I know God smiles on me.
I've never been all that adventurous. I wouldn't be in the way?
Nigel, you'll just have to use your hands- 
You mean nobody died?
All right- let's go into battle.  I'm Redbeard. 
I'm always considerate- my mother taught me that.
...don't know...
But of course yours worked.
I got big. 
You think they'll come then?  Why?
Oh yes. But it takes time.
Hold your son high. 
Thank you, Janosz.  I've learned a lot here, but now that my baby's a little older, I was hoping to rejoin the orchestra.
Actually, I'm not eating lunch today.  I have an appointment.  In fact, I'd better go.
Good night, Janosz.
I don't believe we have the luxury of choice.
Not in this case, my dear.  Take a look. That's not Gainsborough's Blue Boy up there. He's Vigo!
I don't care who he is.  He's not taking my baby.
We don't have a relationship.
Egon, I'd rather you didn't mention any of this to Peter if you don't mind.
I won't.
Thank you.
Didn't I do it?
Good luck.
Oh, hello, Peter.
Peter, what about the bathtub?
For me it's best if I sleep on my side and you spoon up right behind me with your arms around me.  If we go the other way I'm afraid your hair will be getting in my face all night.
Does she know anything about babies?
For one night in your life, do you think it's possible for us to be completely real?
All right, you want to be real?  So tell me why did you dump me?
Peter, do you think maybe I have some genetic problem or something that makes me vulnerable to these supernatural things.
Yeah, I think the Times might be interested, don't you?  The Post might have a lot of fun with it, too.
Ghostbusters.
I was trying to get that smelly green thing. The guys asked me to help out.  I'm like the fifth Ghostbuster.
No, I celebrate at the beginning of my corporate tax year which is March first. That way I beat the crowds.
It's really not a bad place.  It just needs a woman's touch.
Too bad for the Moldavians.

The season of evil begins with the birth of the new year.  Bring me the child that I might live again.
So be it.  On this the day of darkness, she will be ours, wife to you and mother to me.
Sorry, your Honor, but when somebody sets me up like that I can't resist.
I predict that the world will end at the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve.
Seventy-seventh and First Avenue has so many holes already we didn't think anyone would notice.
This won't wait until tomorrow, Venkman. It's hot and it's ready to pop.
Ostrov?  I've been there.  Good party town.
I can't believe things have gotten so bad in this city that there's no way back. Sure, it's crowded, it's dirty, it's noisy. And there are too many people who'd just as soon step on your face as look at you.  But there've got to be a few sparks of sweet humanity left in this burned-out burg.  We just have to mobilize it.
Who?
Who?  Just -- someone we know.
Dana!  Dana Barrett!
It's an interesting one, Pete.  If anything was going on it's totally subdued now.
Well, we sing to it, we talk to it, we say supportive, nurturing things --
Nothing.  Just some mood-slime residue in and around the bathtub.  But we did turn up some interesting stuff on this Vigo character you mentioned.  I found the name Vigo the Carpathian in Leon Zundinger's Magicians, Martyrs and Madmen.  Listen to this:
We're almost there, Lib.  Step on it.
Then let's do it.
Yeah, but what a ride.  You can't make a hamburger without chopping up a cow.
Are you all right?  You coming down with something?
Well don't think!
Groovy.  I've never felt better in my life.
Wonder what?
Have I done the right thing?
Uuuuuuugh!!
Definitely.  I think you may be a very gifted telepath.
I was just going to say "eight."  You're fantastic!
Oh, that's nice, Louis.  I'll stop by if I'm around.
Well, actually Louis I have a friend coming by.
Fine, Louis.  We'll stop in for a drink.
Out!
I'll cancel the reservation,  I found the name "Zuul" in ...  The Roylance Guide to Secret Societies and Sects.  I don't suppose you've  read it.
Back off, man!  I'm a scientist!
We'll get back to you.
And may I see this storage facility?
Go ahead!  Get a court order.  Then I'm gonna sue your ass off for wrongful prosecution.
You volunteered, didn't you?  Aren't we paying you for this?
What on earth gave you that idea?
I'm always serious.
She's telling the truth -- or at least she thinks she is.
Why not?
Trust me.  It will be bad.
I'm with Dana Barrett and she's floating three feet off the bed.
I agree.
She said he was "the Destructor."
Who?
Get a grip on yourself, Egon.  I talked to Dana Barrett and she referred to Gozer as the Destructor.
And look at this, Peter  Cold-riveted girders with selenium cores.
I don't know.  Talk to it.
What do I say?
You're always so worried about your reputation.  We don't need the University. Einstein did his best stuff while he was working as a patent clerk.'They can't stop progress.
Do you know what a patent clerk makes?  I liked the University.  They gave us money, they gave us the facilities and we didn't have to produce anything!  I've worked in the private sector.  They expect results. You've never been out of college.  You don't know what it's like out there.
So far all we got is a shit smell on the twelfth floor and we almost fried a Puerto Rican bellboy.
Sit tight.  I'm on my way.
It's not good, Pete.
Great!  The marshmallows are about to get their revenge.
Me, too. Parts of the Bible are great.
Right.  And the sky would fall ...
Judgement Day ...
Why?  Then they'll notice when I'm gone.  Well.  I'm making a public appearance aren't I?
What is that... wailing?
The fans of Narcissus.  They were on vigil outside the school of Proximo. They believe he's dying.
"... by the emperor of Rome.  This writer asks:  between a Senate that debates truth until they choke, an Emperor who has the birth sign of a woman, is it possible there is more virtue within the arena than without?"
You want control of the crowd -- you can't get it by killing their hero.
That this illness has clouded his mind.
We have to stop the Germans now!
They won't break this one.
I wouldn't know who to bet on.
That makes his birth sign... Virgo! Why that's the sign of a little girl!  Can you tell my readers more about your star-crossed connection with Emperor Commodus?
I believe we are arriving in an enlightened age; an age of peace that will bring Rome her greatest glory.  Thanks to Marcus Aurelius.
The moment you returned from the battle your options were clear.  If you are a friend to neither side, legate, you must be an enemy to both.  We needed to know what you believed.
I need to give you my word when yours is worth nothing?
You're a citizen and a soldier.  Not a gladiator.
That's what worries me...
Only from a distance.
I don't believe that.  He's got the best doctor in the world and a will of iron.  You know we're preparing for a full-blown invasion of Germany.
Do you remember your Epictetus, that little homily we recited when we were children?  The one that was supposed to remind us we were Romans?
Much more colorful than the ones we wear.  And, of course, less dented.
What the hell do you think it was about?  There's nothing an unproved heir to the throne likes less than glaring competence in others.
Well, we can try...
Then give the empire back to the people... the children who will grow up to become senators...
Who else?  I'm the one who runs the estates while you're here risking everything we have for the glory of Rome!  Or for the glory of you!
We don't need your help we're doing great on our own.
I don't even want to imagine the things you've seen...
Chain him.
Make us rich, Proximo, make us very rich...
Fantastic!  Wonderful!  But posters are very expensive.
I want another interview with Cos. Tell him to bring plenty of ink.
Yes.
But could I just tell you this one thing?
No.
We won't. Let's go inside.
Of course there is. Look -- The Veranda Room -- right there.
Let's get out of here, Elaine. Let's go somewhere else.
Yes.
Oh my God --
Where did he say he was going to meet you?
Maybe we could get together some time and talk about it.
What do you think?
All right then! Yes!
Benjamin -- this is my mother!
I don't know.
What?
I don't know. I don't know what's happening.
Benjamin -- I haven't even said I'll marry you yet.
Why wouldn't it?
Why don't I just drag you off? All right -- I will. Right after we get the blood tests.
Carl Smith. He's a medical student. We've known him for years.
Well -- I said I might marry him.
No, Benjamin.
He said he thought we'd make a pretty good team.
Oh no. He said that.
I certainly hope you --
There is a great future in plastics. Think about it. Will you think about it?
Ahhh.
What?
It was just a visitor. But it's all right now.
What for?
Look -- I'll give you ten dollars for a dime -- I'll give you twenty -- for God's sake, will you let me use that phone?
Could I make one phone call first?
Get out!
Yes.
Could you bring it up?
Give me an hour.
A room. I'd like a room, please.
Where is it?
I mean I'd -- I'd rather not go to the trouble of bringing it all in. I just have a toothbrush. I can get it myself. If that's all right.
Will you take me home?
My husband took the car. Will you drive me home?
What for?
But it's light in there now.
Well, why can't you just lock the doors and go to bed?
What do you mean?
Please forgive me. Because I like you. I don't think of you that way. But I'm mixed up.
I know that. But I'm --
But they would! Don't you see?
I'm going home now. I apologize for what I said. I hope you can forget it. But I'm going home right now.
Very well. Thank you.
Nervous. Well, I am a bit nervous. I mean it's -- it's pretty hard to be suave when you're --
Benjamin.
You what?
Are you afraid of me?
Art. That's a good subject. You start it off.
You start it off. I don't know anything about it.
I don't.
Do you really want me to?
I got up.
I got up. I ate breakfast and went shopping. During the afternoon I read a novel.
I walk out.
Please. Now tell me. How do you know he won't wake up sometime and follow you.
We're talking.
Thank you.
Well how long has this been going on.
Man, is this interesting.
I mean it doesn't sound like it could be much worse. If you hated him at least you'd hate him.
Think real hard, Benjamin.
Don't tell Elaine.
Are you shocked?
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. So how did it happen?
What?
Not particularly.
We'd go to his car.
Oh no. In the car you did it?
Really. I want to know.
No.
You're not.
Are you?
You're goddamn right I am.
You don't have to say that.
Promise me, Benjamin.
Do exactly what I say.
Where is Elaine?
I think we have everything quite under control now, Benjamin. Would you like a quick drink before you go?
I'm sorry we won't be able to invite you to the wedding, Benjamin, but the arrangements have been so rushed --
Goodnight, sir.
I'm not with your party -- I'm sorry.
Well this is your business, Benjamin.  If you --
-- then I'll simply invite all the Robinsons' over for dinner on Thursday.
Oh, Ben -- this is so -- exciting --
Well -- when did you decide all this?
I guess I'll just tell Mr. Robinson that you're just too busy every evening -- doing God knows what --
No. She doesn't know about it.
Standing guard over the old castle, are you?
Yes, sir.
No. No -- I'm just -- I'm just a little worried about my future. I'm a little upset about my future.
Thank you.
I know.
In many ways I feel as though you were my own son.
Ben -- I think -- I think you ought to be taking it a little easier right now than you seem to.
Listen to me. We got -- we got into bed with each other. But it was nothing. It was nothing at all. We might -- we might just as well have been shaking hands.
Shaking hands. Well, that's not saying much for my wife, is it?
Mrs. Robinson?
It's a wonderful thing to have so many devoted friends.
Yes.
And what are you going to do?
You might find a bullet through that head...
Oh, my large and noisy neighbor -- really? That? 
You?
Of course.
Chasing what?
Anything for you.
And Baron, thanks so much for everything.
Why do you hide in my room?
But surely you must know -- because I love you.
And -- and --
Am I quite strange to you?
I never knew it was so dangerous to hide in a woman's room when she's alone. 
Just for a minute then.
I'm a prodigal son, the black sheep of a white flock -- I shall die on the gallows.
So --
Yesterday I was a thief -- but now, --
Yes.
Can't -- can't you -- Couldn't you come too -- I think it would be better -- for us -- for us both.
I have no money now -- I must get some first -- I must get some.
I'll go. -- I love you.  I'll be on that train. I'll get the money.
Don't.
Not at all, sir. 
I'm Baron von Gaigern.
Do I know him -- I know him through and through.
No thanks -- keeping my head clear.
Good!
All of that at once, Baron?
Goodnight, Kringelein. 
If you occupied the room next to Madam Grusinskaya, you would appreciate the quiet of a hotel lobby.
Insolent -- Berlin manners.
We shall see who remains here the longer.
As you will.
Mr. Preysing -- one sixty-four.
Your chauffeur's been waiting, Baron.
It seems that he was a thief and an imposter.
Pain? Oh, no, Doctor. I think if I had pain I'd be too happy to notice it...
You must learn as quickly as your time allows -- Believe me Mr. Kringelein, a man who isn't with a woman is a dead man.
I was sent as a military surgeon to South Africa. Stinking climate. Taken prisoner. Home on parole not to fight. I was a surgeon in the Great War till the end. Grenade in the face. Carried diphtheria bacilli in the wound until 1920. Isolated two years.  I've been everything.
Yes -- and for me, it's going to leave at any minute. Let's drink.
Yes -- that --
She's beautiful -- isn't she?
You'll have a good time with me. Want to? I've got enough money. Ten thousand two hundred in my pocketbook. Three thousand four hundred that I won. It will last a long time. I can win more -- we'll travel.
Only in mutual advantages -- moreover.
Yes... A man I know took me to Switzerland last month...
What?
Is that Mrs. Preysing.
I'll remember you, Mr. Kringelein.
You're a funny little creature, Flaemmchen. I can't make you out.
All right.
Mop rags --!
Yes --
Gentlemen, I am now free to announce...  ...that the deal between my firm and the Manchester Cotton Company has been successfully negotiated.
In that case give us the articles. We'll sign at once. We know all the details...
Oh, Suzette -- Suzette -- Sshh -- quiet.
Take them back, Suzette.
You'll be very much alone, my dear madame. This is the end. 
Well, now, that's very kind -- thanks. That's what I want -- a large room on the front with a private bath -- Yes, that's what I want. I can pay now if you like.
You say that you are employed by us in Fredersdorf, and here you are in Berlin, indulging in diversions which ill befit your position and which are very much beyond your means -- Quite extraordinary, Mr. Kringelein, I think we will look into your books.
You may go, Mr. Kringelein.
Oh, no -- no -- not the Baron.
Madam Grusinskaya's car.
I'll see you in the morning then, at the conference. Everything'll be all right, Preysing... Don't worry. Goodnight.
Yes -- I must go to England -- I was desperate -- Now I don't care -- This sort of thing goes to a man's head.
Say it -- say it -- my lie -- it's the first time in thirty years that I've ever... Where's that stenographer? Miss Flaemm...
Bluff does it, Preysing, bluff does it. Goodnight.
And if you do it wrong?
Oh, well, you know. I just clip a buck here and a buck there. Not enough to notice.
Good evening. I'd like a single for tonight.
No problem. My husband gets up the crack of dawn.  It's his kidneys.
Oh, I know, I know, and you've been wonderful since I was widowed. But Mister Hebbing has--  -- you don't mind my telling him, darling --  -- suffered reverses. If he could...
We have to be ready. We have to have the money, and we have to know what the information means, and we have to move immediately.
His blood pressure is under a hundred. I don't think he'll live to get to the hospital.
Delmar? I never go out to California. That's a thousand miles from here.
Nine hundred. Bobo needs somebody to handle playback this time. Come on, Lilly, you don't argue with Bobo.
Hello.
So I heard.
Well...
Fair enough.
They twisted my arm.
You're one to talk. Still running playback money for the mob.
The first day of the Delmar meet, there was a nag called Bluebell. I should have been on it. But that was the day after you came in here, so I stuck around to see how you were gonna be.
Roy, I don't want money from you.
This way's perfect.
I know you do, so that's why --
And to survive, my way, I need money. Bobo knows about the stash in the car, so I didn't dare touch it, not if Lilly Dillon's dead. So that leaves this.
Oh? I didn't know anything was.
Uh-huh.
Just trying to help, Lilly.
You called the doctor, huh?
Mama!
I don't like to come here, Roy. Every time I do, your mother comes in and makes remarks.
Because it's comfortable.
See you soon.
I'm a salesman.
Roy, you're a short-con operator. And a good one, I think. Don't talk to me like I'm another square.
Nobody does that single-o.
Is that right?
I thought these people were broke.
No, no, Roy, just cash poor. They had savings accounts, stocks to sell, houses to mortgage. Sell their wife's jewelry. Oh, they had a lot of money, when they put their minds to it. Or when I put their minds to it. I stayed with them, that's the roper's job, made them get up every penny they could raise, turn it all over to Cole.
He retired.
I don't know, Myra, I never had partners. I never needed them.
But why not? I thought it was settled. What's holding you back?
Do you have any particular reason to say that?
Well, uh, you know, she ate the gun.
With all due respect, detective, you can't go blaming every brutal murder in Illinois on Michael Meyers.
Charming.
The door was open, so we let ourselves in.
Pretty messy.  Parents have already been notified.  Our office has been trying to get a hold of you...
Well, maybe if you'd let me live in the dorms, I wouldn't have to sneak out to spend time with my friends.
Just forget it...
Will, sit down...
It's not going to happen.
Have enough fun for the both of us.
No!  I keep seeing him staring out his window. Watching me.
Shit, Beth, why do we have to be the ones to organnize this friggin' fair? It's only Halloween.
You've been watching too much TV.
Danny, you're just going to have to wait!
Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's coming?
Here.  Let me try.
Or what's left of him.
This is madness, Wynn.
Home.  Jesus.  I'm like this.  Home!
Looseleaf--will you get the hell home?
At least we found the diamonds.
I'll buy a hundred more Cadillacs. Go home!
Leave me alone!  After eight years of horrendously close association, the time has come to part!  I crave solitude and time for reflection-- and then a reunion in privacy with my own flesh and blood.  You and I may not meet again for months!
Let's talk about something else.
I sure didn't expect her to drop dead.
How about breakfast, wife?
When I was a naive young recruit in Spain, I used to wonder why soldiers bayoneted oil paintings, shot the noses off of statues and defecated into grand pianos.  I now understand: It was to teach civilians the deepest sort of respect for men in uniform-- uncontrollable fear.  To our women.
The world is teeming with women-- ours to enjoy.
It helped more than you know.  Down deep, people were deeply affected.
You're so low!  Look at that beautiful red meat.  You haven't touched it.
I dunno.
You did?
You.
Anybody who'd drop an atom bomb on a city has to be pretty dumb.
If what?
It sapped our will--made us peaceful and unenterprising.  It was a form of chemical castration. We became two more sleepy Indians.
You're making a joke.
I'm interested in long-term expectations.
To make an ass of yourself.
As a matter of fact--I am home.
Hello.
Is anybody besides you here now?
I'll see.
I was going to a funny movie, but I changed my mind.  If you're depressed, laughing doesn't help much.  When did you know my father?
Everybody says he was so brave.
He doesn't do it in front of me, but he does it with Mother.  You know what he called Father one time?
No.
Aha!  He has a brilliant military record, I'm sure.
We came up behind a sentry, and your father slit his throat before he could utter a sound.
Sir?
She was on her way home from a meeting of the African Violet Society, and they got her.
The smallest thing I've got.
A hundred dollars for breakfast?
You're free to go to her, if you want.  If you'd rather be a woman and run with the women, just say the word.
No.
Welcome to manhood, you little sparrowfart!  Load that gun!
Did you ever daydream that you would one day meet a friendly millionaire?
This reunion isn't what I imagined it would be.
You feel that you're behaving as a woman should?
We thought a doctor might help.
He's a very decent man, Harold.
I had a trip.  We'll honeymoon here.  Go out and play.
I have a brain.
Ram it up your ass!
What a honeymoon.
I will not be scrogged.  I remember one time I saw you wrench a hook from the throat of a fish with a pair of pliers, and you promised me that the fish couldn't feel.
The whole concept of heroism--and its sexual roots.
Tell me about its sexual roots.
I learned a lot of things in college.  Actually--it was Norbert who told me that.
His most cherished possession?  His violin, I guess.
And no one's there now?
What are you going to do?
You feel I've done a dreadful thing--leaving him?
I want you to tell me that you loved me once.
How unhappy he's going to be--alone in his room.
That's really what you want.  You become furious when people won't make you dead.
Stop!
I want you to get out of here, Norbert.  Harold--I want you to sit down in the chair, and not lift a finger until Norbert is gone.
Out!
He's dead, you know.
Dead!  Such a final word.  Dead!  Did you hear that?
Hello, Mother.
We'll miss you so.
Ahh--then she's still alive.
She still has just the one child-- the boy?
And you come into Mrs. Ryan's apartment as often as you please, looking into various health matters?
You have chills?
I've never heard of it.
That's an editorial we, of course. I haven't turned up anything personally.
You were wrong, you quack!
What for?
This little corpse is intended as a lesson?
The same hairy, humorless old gods who move you from hither to yon. "Honor, " if you like.
We'll find out now, won't we?
Now who's being cruel?
Yes--well--uh--that's another one of those statements which more or less automatically requires an apology.  Whenever you feel like it. It's sort of like turning off an alarm clock that's ringing loudly. Your apology turns off the alarm.
I love you!  Have a cigar!
Give me your word of honor that that's all you're going to do.
So that's it! "Kestenbaum, Kestenbaum." Everybody was yelling "Kestenbaum, Kestenbaum." I thought it was some foreign language.
Alice is dead?
Ja?
The wife of Harold Ryan is going to marry a pansy next?  This is the end of Western Civilization as far as I'm concerned.  You must be crazy as a fruitcake.
He's alive!
You know she has no feet!  You want him to abandon his mother, who has no husband, who has no money of her own, who has no feet?
Norbert was just beginning practice. A real man would have sold her to a catfood company, I suppose.  As far as that goes, J. Edgar Hoover still lives with his mother.
Then get him.
It's fine!
Keeps fairies away!
Or was.  We haven't done anything wrong, you know.
I'm glad.
That's when I'll get my confidence back.
Seven jaguars' skins, I'm told. Harold shot every one.  Shall we go?
A what?
For Harold.  When Paul comes home, we can have some birthday cake.
Wear a coat of domestic mink.  For the love of God, though, Penelope, don't lightheartedly advertise that the last of the jaguars died for you.
That's the XKE.
I wish Paul luck.
Paul's only twelve years old.
You fake!  You're no better than the dumbest general in the Pentagon.  You're not going to beat Harold. You're not going to beat anybody. You're not going to stay here, either--yammering and taunting until you're most gloriously killed. Go home!
I'm sick of this argument.  I just have one more thing to say: If you elect a President, you support him, no matter what he does.  That's the only way you can have a country!
It's the planet that's in ghastly trouble now and all our brothers and sisters thereon.
Walt Disney, who gave us Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, plays shuffleboard.  Jesus Christ plays shuffleboard.
You bet! "The Harold Ryan Fan Club." Pink, eh?  With a yellow streak up the back.  We got very good tailor shops up here.  They'll make you any kind of uniform, any kind of sweatsuit you want.  Judas Iscariot--he's got this black jacket with a skull and crossbones over the heart.  He walks around all hunched over, and he never looks anybody in the eye, and written on the back of his jacket are the words, "Go take a flying--
I'm sorry, Mr. Brown. I'm sure you're very good, but at the moment, I've got nothing for you. If something comes up, we'll give you a call.
What are you doing?
Keep me informed of what he's up to. You help me, I'll help you.
We offer Female Wrestling, that is, nude body to body contact, with a girl of your choice in a private room. Twenty dollars a half hour, thirty dollars hour. Any other arrangements may be discussed in the privacy of your room. Tipping is permitted. We accept Bank Americard, Master Charge and American Express.
No, I don't.
Pull out your cock.
What?
What do you want to tip me for? Look, you got to spell it out. Whatever you want, just say it.
I said I just wanted to talk to you...
Look, I don't know anybody. I never seen her before.
Yeah.
You kidding? Three days work. I finish tonight.
No.
Got any parts? I'm free. Not free- free, but, you know, free. I don't really do this.
Last I heard he went to San Diego.
When do we start?
Tonight. When you get out, we'll go.  Why didn't you tell the other detective?
Huh?
She's dead.
No. But does it make any difference?  How did you get to be the way you are?
Why? Are you a sex fiend?
He deals in pain.
Christian Reformed. It's a Dutch Calvinist denomination.
But then you'll forget about me.
That's right.
As I was saying, I'll pick up the thread. There's a number of ways I can go. There's not much you can do here. Stay if you want. Maybe it'd be better if you went back home. Go through Kristen's personal stuff. Ask around, maybe she knew somebody out here.  Look, I do this a lot. I work at a minimum rate of $750.00 a week. It may seem like a lot of money to you, but it ain't. You could hire cheaper.
And better?
I suppose. But I'll tell you, Jake, I'm like a little animal. When I get my teeth into something I never let go. If your daughter's here, I'll track her down.
I'll be there.
That's like a stag film.
No.
I don't know.
Get out. Get out of here, Goddammit.
Go home, pilgrim. There's nothing you can do. Forget this place. Start over.
I'll come with you. Let me pack some things.
We're casting for an explicit sex action feature...
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
I thought you were quite good in it. I also like the girl in it. Really thought she was good.  I wondered if she was still around. If she was still working.
Meet me here today at seven o'clock. With the money. Then we'll go see the film.
I want to know where my daughter is. Her name is Kristen, or Joanne. She's with you.
You ain't goin' nowhere alone.
What?
It's fifty cents admission. It's applicable to a purchase.
No, take it. I don't want your Goddamn fifty cents.
Film making can be pretty expensive...
What exactly do you have in mind?
In other words, you want to get laid?
Not exactly...
Okay. Keep in touch with my secretary.
Well, each time he comes in closer, like this.
You have to understand. He can be mean, self-righteous. He had a Vishund once. Loved that dog. He came home one day and the dog bit him. He took that dog and staked him out in the back yard. It was winter. Every day he came home and watched that dog until he froze. He's capable of doing anything.
Political Science. It's all about what's going on.
Yes, that's good planning. Tell me, are you a regular, Candy, in this computer club?
No.
I suppose they are in the truck. Are you going to take a lot of time with this?
I don't know.
Nice to meet you.
Well then, I must be off.  We shall have to meet again.
Not <u>any</u> car. I like to keep a variety. I'm always looking for the new experience, like this one. I liked it.
Still, I think you'd upset people and I'm not sure that's right.
No.
Me! No. Of course not.
Subways... Perfume... Cigarette...  ... Cologne... Carpet... Chestnuts! ... <u>Snow!</u>
But what?
Why not?
What is that he's working on?
Oh, Big Issues. Liberty. Rights. Justice. Kings died and kingdoms fell. I don't regret the kingdoms - what sense in borders and nations and patriotism - but I do miss the kings. When I was a little girl I was taken to the palace in Vienna, to a garden party. I can still see the sunshine, the parasols, and the flashing uniforms of the young officers. I thought then I would marry a soldier.  Later, Frederick would chide me about it.  He was so serious. A doctor at the University. And in the government.
Well, don't go.
No. It had nothing on this afternoon.
Come on, you loved it. It was a new experience.
Science thinks there isn't. That we are all alone in the universe.
Maude.
Never! Never! I'll never forget you. I wanted to marry you. Don't you understand! I love you. I love you!
I have a sore throat.
Mother.
Fay, I'll call you back.  What did you say?
No. My uncle.
Fifteen.
What else do you like?
I go to funerals.
No.
Your studies?
No.  I'd have liked to.
Jeez, sir. That's pretty strong stuff.
Jeez! That's a great story,
Sure. Be able to tell your children. Something for them to look up to. Be proud of.
That's right.
To kill. The taste of blood in your mouth.
And to use the bayonet? PACHOIE!
Yes.
To strangle someone. Choke him. Squeeze out his life between your hands.
Crazy parasite! Commie bastard! Get out of here.
Yes, ma'am. Somebody had some trouble parking.
Yes.
Oh, yes. How did you like that?
She certainly has.
What's the matter with her?
If anyone can help, HE can.
What do you mean?
I don't know, Kyle. You're the fucking expert. Now get out of the way!
Go on. But trick us again, child, and your suffering will be legendary even in Hell.
The Cenobites.
Don't worry about fingerprints. I never had any.
Oooh!! Who was here? Nixon? Houdini? You mind sharing your mystic insights?
Story of my life.
You mean, outside... with her.
We don't take hints.
I dunno, maybe five seconds -- ow!
Oh, right --
In private, if you don't mind...
There is a place -- a dark place where evil slumbers and awaits to return. From there it infects our dreams. Our thoughts. Grigory gave us a glance tonight --
Spiritual advisor to the Romanovs.  In 1916, at a dinner in his honor, he was poisoned, shot, stabbed, clubbed, drowned and castrated.
No. It was red. Bright red.
A prison. The Vatican deemed its contents dangerous enough to include it on the List of Avignon. Of which we hold a copy.
Abe possesses a unique frontal lobe.  "Unique." That's a word you'll hear quite a bit around here.
Did he, now?
"Myers", huh? You have a first name??
Okay. You saw the fish man, right?
Who?!
That's what you do. That's why we need you. You have an insight.  You know monsters.
When we do: No mumbo-jumbo. Double- core Vulcan-65 grenades.
Don't move. We --
Not from you.
Miss Sherman, he's asking you back, but it's entirely your choice.
No... He's determined. Unstoppable --
You want to know -- Now -- ? Here? Red, white, whatever -- Guys are all the same.
Sure.
It's a means to summon us -- it's called the Lament Configuration.
No!
You can keep them.
Oh Christ.
This isn't happening.
That's right. Who are you?
Well can I come in or not?
What happened to you?
Back from where?
Good.
Keep your voice down.
You promised me an explanation.
Let me see.
Hell...
You're still afraid.
So you were cheated.
Maybe.
I need a skin. Then we leave --
I have to see my father.
No argument.
Oh Christ. Julia...
So damn stupid.
You're done worse.
Just feeling a bit sick.
Sure.
O.K.
Only I'll turn it off --
Just soda.
That depends.
You want something to drink?
So, what's your problem? Let's get to it.  You're not going to change your fucking mind ?
Let's keep it that way, shall we?
You know you are. Loveliest woman I ever set eyes on.
Try me.
I'm not going to change my mind, Dad.
You will keep in touch.
Kirsty.
I guess.
No you don't.
So lie down.
I see.
We're not all frigid.
Oh no.
Well you've just been talking to the wrong people.
Your father told me you were working here.
Really.
I beg your pardon?
Play it.
But now I kind of like it.
-- Barry, if I were to say to you I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet, what would that mean?
But in your opinion, would I definitely go?
Fuck off, Barry.
No.  We need the gig.
What do you think?  Dick likes it.
Oh yeah.  We got it.
Do you even know your daughter? There is no way she likes that song. Or is she in a coma?
Do not get ahead of yourself.
I have a television.
He's not worth it!
Just that Rob seems to think it would be wiser to start a record label by putting out a record with business- crippling Nazi Youth shoplifters than with someone he knows in his bitter jealous heart is a musical visionary.  That's all.
Uh.  That's me.
Is there a difference?
OF COURSE... Well yeah, a bit. "Sin City" by the Flying Burrito Brothers is an all-time top five, but I wouldn't play it at the club.  It's a country-rock ballad.  Everybody'd go home.
What do you mean, four more?
Well, I wouldn't mind a quick chat, if you got the time.
Yeah.
Oh, you know... a lot of people aren't too old for clubs but they're too old for acid jazz and garage and ambient and all that.  They want to hear old funk and Stax and New Wave and Old School Hip Hop and some new stuff all together and there's nowhere for them.
Oh, hi.  Hi, Rob.
'Cause you like their second one, you said, Pop, Girls. etc.  The one with Cheryl Ladd on the cover.  You didn't see the cover though.
Yeah, I haven't really absorbed that one.
Well, I'll just make it for you.
Can I help you?
I want a tape.
Think about it, Rob.
I thought I could give you a lift back.
Just the obvious stuff.
Well then why don't you quit it while you seem to not be ahead?
I'm too tired for this now.  I know I'm asking a lot, but will you take off for a while so I can get my stuff packed up?  I need to be able to think while I do it and I can't think while you're here.
No problem.  If I can ask one question.
Of course it is.
I haven't felt like it.
But not even before, when he was living upstairs?
Call me at work.  We can arrange to meet properly.  I don't want this to be the last conversation we have.  I know what you're like.
Jesus.  I do not know.  I'll talk to you later.
Ray.  I hate Ian.
You know I'm a good person.
Mmm hmm.
Hey, how ya doin'?
Who the fuck's Pig?
My dad died.  My dad, my dad.
In a minute.  When I get it together.
I want to feel something else than this.  It's either that or I go home and put my hand in the fire.  Unless you want to stub cigarettes out on my arm.
It'll have to be sex, then.
I lived with you.  You were my partner just a few weeks ago and now you're worried I might kill you, and you're entitled to worry.  Isn't that a terrible thing?  Isn't that sad?
It was like sex.  What else could it be like?
Hey, great idea.  What I'll do is, tomorrow I'll get a hold of a box full of mint Elvis Presley 78s on the Sub label, and I'll pay for it that way.
You haven't changed so much as a pair of socks in the years I've known you.  If we've grown apart, then I'm the one who's done the growing, and all I've done is change jobs.
And hairstyles and clothes and attitude and friends and...
You're tougher.
Less neurotic.  Are you intending to stay the same for the rest of your life?
I'm alright.
Barry?  Barry knows about this?
Right.
Oh, well thanks a fucking bunch.
I mean, maybe you're right.  But were you really expecting me to say yes?
Isn't that how it is for everybody?
Oh, right.  Alright.
I'll call you.
Great.  Super-fantastic.
She just called.  She doesn't even know.  It's probably the last time I'll ever hear her voice.  That's weird, isn't it?  You spend Christmas at somebody's house, you know, and you worry about their operations and you see them in their bathrobe, and... I dunno...
I'm going to drink this bottle of wine watch TV and go to bed.  Then tomorrow I'll get up and go to work.
But you must have --
Oh, come on!  Let me give you ten dollars for this, and you can give the rest away for all I care.
Naw.  Those are for us.
Oh really.  You two are slamming to Nico now?
What's the name of your label?
Go to hell.
It's my birthday.
Don't know about any of that. Suppose nobody does.
The boy _died_?
I think you do.  Better yet, I don't think anything was stolen because nothing was there in the first place. And I think Mr. Smith, whoever he is, now knows that.
It will take some time for the forms to clear before you go to Gettysburg.
Yes.
Hardly a reason to run off with a murderer.
There are differences.
You kill with your left hand?
Come here, Brenna.
Damn you.
Be careful.  Don't stay any longer than you have to.
I'll destroy you.  I've destroyed everything I've ever touched!  Oh God...
Life is only life when it is bounded by death.  The inheritance is death. The gift is the finality of life. To be part of the fabric.  The inside.  I love you Brenna.
Don't they have enough for you to do at the castle?
Thanks.
What are you getting at, Moran?
All I need is for you to check the name.
I've seen nobleman swords that weren't as well preserved.  It's just a hunk of peasant iron.  Why would he be carrying it around in an alley?
Stop.
Juan Cid Romirez.  Chief surveyor and alchemist.
I was nearly killed.
But you lived.
Do you ever feel a flow, as if some- thing were pushing against you?
Does it change with me in the room?
I don't know why.
We are brothers.
What?
No!
Of course.
I have no future husband.
Live?  In less than a week you're prancing about the country like a squirrel.
So why the crazy talk?  It's a miracle it is.  Saint Andrew has smiled on me.  On us.
You surprise me.  Eliminating a rival like that.  Such are the actions of a man of conquest.  I was mistaken.  300 years have turned the boy's fear into ambit- ion.
I know you very well, Conor MacLeod. And I can see the truth beginning to make itself clear to you.  Mulet, Romirez, they were fools without vision.  It was destined that the board would be cleared for the real players.
They're nothing but boys.  It will be a slaughter tomorrow.
If you wish to play games, Major.
Must he go?
Round up who you can and put them on standby.
No.  I want this to be all ours.
It is the gathering, my friend.  The settling of old scores.
What's the point!  You have me, finish it!
I have waited forever for this. You will not cheapen it, little boy.
Go to hell.
No.
His name was Iman Fasil if that jogs your memory.
Your murder weapon?
All I need is time.
When may I expect the cleaners?
The Sheriff has just received four more letters threatening his life, but he says nothing can interfere with his duty.
That's Bensinger. That's his desk.
Open this door!
What?
That's what he did to me. Swept me right off my feet -- and left me lying on the floor.
He certainly -- hic -- does!
But --
Better make that a certified check, Walter.
Believe me, Bruce, I know what I'm doing. He'd get you in a crap game --
I'm sure you haven't any.
For a minute, I thought maybe Walter Burns was at the back of it. But then I realized he couldn't have been.
Bruce, you know I'm mad about you and stop talking like that.  Walter!
Did you give her the money?
Fine.
It's simple. A poor little dope who lost his job went berserk and shot a cop who was coming after him to quiet him down.
I'm beginning to realize that.
Certified! I'm afraid Hildy'd feel ashamed to think she hadn't trusted you.
So long.
Suppose she is -- I have feelings, too! Do you know where I've been for the last couple of hours? Locked up in a police station and she didn't move to do anything about it.
You can't bluff me, Burns. I don't care who you are or what paper you're editor of.
Who's under arrest? You pimple-headed, square-toed spy -- do you realize what you're doing?
Holy mackerel! Look, Walter, that's what divorces are for.
Now, that's a nice thing to say.
Well, I don't want to brag, but I've still got the dimple -- and in the same place -- I just acted like any husband who doesn't want to see his home broken up.
Well, suppose we did? That isn't what I got married for. What's the good of -- Look, Walter, I came up here to tell you that you'll have to stop phoning me a dozen times a day -- sending twenty telegrams -- all the rest of it, because I'm --
I have a lunch date. I just want --
Don't tell me what to do! We're divorced -- I'm a free woman. You're not my husband and you're not my boss! And what's more, you're not going to be my boss.
What's the matter?
All right -- thirty-five, and not a cent more!
I'm not working for any other paper!
Oh! In that case, the raise is off and you go back to your old salary and like it. Trying to blackjack --
Where'd you meet this man?
Bermuda.
Not what you'd call rich. Makes about five thousand a year.
Well, I can, and I love it! He forgets the office when he's with me. He doesn't treat me like an errand-boy -- he treats me like a woman.
Say, could I meet him?
Oh, better not, Walter. Wouldn't do any good.
So -- Sweeney gets twins -- and Earl Williams gets hanged tomorrow.
Yes --- and that's putting it mildly! No certified check -- no story -- Get me?
No thanks, I've still got those. Well, I'll step into some working clothes and hop over to the Press Room for the background on this yarn. It'll be kind of fun to see the boys again, too. Remember, Bruce, it must be certified.
It cost me four hundred and fifty bucks to tear it out of Cooley.
It better be fifteen minutes, because Bruce is waiting downstairs in a taxicab and that meter's clicking away to beat the band.
You know! You've got the brain of a pancake! That wasn't just a story you covered -- it was a revolution! Hildy! This is the greatest yarn in journalism since Livingstone discovered Stanley for the New York Herald! 
We'll lower it out of the window with pulleys. Quit stallin'.
Where's Bruce?
Bruce? Oh -- er -- he went out to get the tickets.
What happened?
Louie!
I don't care if you've been after her for six years! Butch, our whole lives are at stake! Are you going to let a woman come between us after all we've been through?
Shut up, will you?  You sure? Nobody?
Yes! What are you afraid of Hildy? I dare him to move that desk out of here.
And your arrest. You'll each get about ten years, I think.
Well, maybe I'd like to know just once!
What's the good of arguing about something that probably doesn't exist? Look, Hildy, I'm proposing to you. What do you say?
Well, I'd like to be lady-like and think it over.
I don't want to rush you. Take a couple of seconds.
You know you did!
And that means Earl Williams dies tomorrow morning and makes a sucker out of us!
He's on my phone. He just called me.
I can't Hildy. It means my job! It means --
Me, too.
A joint interview, eh? That might be all right. We could have our pictures taken together, Doctor.
Yes, I suppose so. It all helps.
Point the gun at me!
I know, I just want to give him a thrill.
What have you got, Hildy?
Oh, that'll be all right, Hildy. Go ahead, run it. And you can say I treated him well, too.  'Lo, Earl. How are you feeling?
The names are Merwyn D. Mayor, who is the Mayor's brother-in-law --
Cover up that transmitter!
Now take that guilty look off your face, Pete -- and stop trembling like a horse.
If we didn't have election Tuesday I'd have this on my conscience.
Well! Looks like about ten years apiece for you birds!
What did you do with her?
This is Hildy Johnson...  Oh, I can give it up all right. Without a single quiver. I'm going to live like a human being -- not like you rats.  Oh, is that you, Walter dear? Oh, I didn't mean "dear." That was just habit, I guess. Oh, be yourself, Walter. I've got some news for you... Yes, I got the interview, but I've got some news that's more important.
Huh?
No -- and you don't know that your cheap boss has had Mr. Baldwin arrested again -- do you?
You don't have to go with me at all! Just give me my son's money and you can stay here forever as far as I'm concerned. Stay with that murderer you caught!
Yes -- that's right. Production for use.
Keep away!
Don't cry, Mollie, there's nothing to cry about.
Let 'em take me. It's better that way.
We'll get you out in ten minutes.
They're not human!
Shut up, you!
For heaven's sake, why not?
Is it hard?
You can't bribe me!
His Honor, the Mayor, now comes out with a statement that Earl Williams is a dangerous character in the employ of two or three foreign governments and the police are going to get him dead or alive. Somebody sends out a tip that this guy is hiding in Molly Malloy's joint. And this colored policeman, Daniels, goes over to pick Williams up. Williams has read the papers, thinks the cop is going to kill him and shoots first. That is all.
Wants Hildy -- and sounds very excited.
Yes.
I only know one.
Please God. Not on us. Drop it on Mrs. Evans. She's a cow.
That's not the point.
Thank you Billy, from the baby and me.
Thanks, son. I can hear it. I'm not sleeping, just closing my eyes.
Who pays for them?
We will, you will, for the rest of our lives?
Air-raid?
I will if you will!
Oh, that.
I wish you could have told me yourself.  Oh, Grace, it's not for long. They say it'll be over by Christmas.
Half the time he's bluffing.
It's not. It's happening to me.
Wasn't it lovely?
It's just the wrench, Grace. It's for their sake.
...since I used to take you to the Proms?
You were never apart, you and Clive. He kept asking and asking.  And I waited and waited for you to say something. And you never did.
Look after yourself, Grace.
My aunt in Australia has offered..
I know you mean well.
Really, that's a long time.
Baby! Stop!
Oh... yeah, he already left. We'll wait inside, come on.
You're welcome.
Mmmmm, this is tasty.
Whoopie fucking doo.
Fucking great.
If we're talking cute... like regular cute, I'd say Leslie Van Houton, but cute ain't hot.
Yeah, no shit.
As far a hot... goes I gotta go with... Ruth Ann Moorehouse.
Oh yeah, I forgot about her. She was pretty hot.
Dude, talk about baggage, that ain't no carry-on shit, that's some heavy duty Samsonite shit.
Then the devil says, "are you gay?" Guy says, "fuck no"... Devil says, "Well then, I guess you're gonna hate Thursdays."
Yeah, I fixed it. Well, I ain't... um, I can't remember. I think I took it out to fit the bags and forgot to put it back.
Alright, alright. I know... I wanted to be the photographer.
She looks like a freak.
Quiet.
Oh, I'm sorry, bothering you? Was I disturbing your viewing pleasure?
Well, I'll try but I don't know nothing 'bout nobody. I'm a guy who likes to mind his own business, if ya get what I'm saying.
Is that all... think real hard.
The retard over at Molly's fruit stand.
What?
I'm sure that ain't the only place he's sticking those pencils.
I always loved that mute broad that Chuck Heston was shacking up with.
Nova, yeah she looked pretty sweet.
Yeah, so how does that fit with the story of four morons with a flat tire looking for a dead tree?
So.
Blah, blah, blah... it doesn't say, but she was released sometime in 1937, only to reappear as Ellie Bogdan, the arm-less wonder. Says she, "criss-crossed the United States constantly in carnivals and freak shows until her death in 1946."
These dates perfectly correspond with the time frame of our beloved Dr. Satan working at the looney bin. I'll bet he amputated her arms.
I don't...  ...I just thought it was weird.
Yes, thank you. Thank you very much.
I don't know, I think he's funny.
Rise and shine.
Aw, shit...  I gotta pee anyway.
God, I hate falling asleep in the afternoon. Now I'll be up all night...  ...ugh, my back is killing me.
A vehicle registered to a William S. Hudley.
Yeah, no mercy here.
That's the understatement of the year.
His name is Rufus, Rufus Jr., but we all call him R.J.
Oh, right.
I'll bet you are... you are a naughty little thing aren't ya.
I was just kidding.
Enough with the stupid voices.
Negative. Shit, we are so deep in the sticks we could walk for hours and find zero.
Oh, it's real... as real as I want it to be, mamma...  ...look, see the magic in my brush strokes.
You, my dear worm feeder, are about to become immortalized.
No they couldn't, somebody had to see something.
Shit... fuck procedure.
Call Wydell.
Yes, sir.
That's it?
Dr. Satan?
Your Spidey senses tingling.
It's not so bad.  So, it just keeps growing?
You're fucked up, Lila.  Why don't you fucking try electrolysis or something? Figure it out for chrissake.
Gabrielle.
I am a foolish little thing. I am pink in my face, no? It is only that I have been so lonely lately and... I am ashamed. I'll see you tomorrow, okay? Unless... Am I fired now?
I like it when you say my name. Is that stupid?
Nothing, my darling. All is right with the world.
But I don't know how to leave Lila.
Unnhh.
Hi. It's Nathan.
Terrific. We're all going to be rich and famous.
That's Lila?
I don't know.
You better believe they're dirty! And smelly! And messy! And they don't know their forks from their assholes!
It's okay, Puff.
No. This is the end of the road. There's a dead human being here. For all of his faults, he was a human being, and certainly a victim of his culture as much as anybody.
Won't he be able to tell?
My brother says he likes you, too.
One night stand?
Let me tell you, honey, midgets are the best kept secret in male companionship. They're portable. They're controllable. They're eager. And they're exactly the right height for a little covert oral fun on the dance floor.
Lila, I want to help you.
Let's get you out of here. Come stay with me until you get your strength back.  Free electrolysis, if you want it! We'll get that face of yours cleared up in no time.
You've got to respect that.
I have to say that I'm not there yet.
Tell her, Harold...  It's just that... It's nothing. It's just that the outside fork is the salad fork. One goes from the outside in as the dinner progresses.
You do?
Nathan!
Fifteen.
Yes.
What?
No. Too... upright. Might've been a person.
Feral? Don't touch him! He might be diseased! He might... My God, rabies!
I think we should go. Please. Before he wakes up and, I don't know, eats us, or whatever feral things do.
Nathan, what the hell are you talking about?
You'd be taking away his freedom, Nathan.
Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose, Lila, to quote Janet Jackson.
Great. Grab his feet. We'll throw him in the trunk.
Your entire body?
Don't quibble. You know what I mean.
Please, Nathan. I really need this. You've been working late a lot.
Do you like my new look?
Sure. Of course.
...the back door of a movie theater. Yes, indeed.
I'll make it.  I'm so happy, Nathan! Everything's going to be so great! Scotch on the rocks, right?  Just kidding. I know what you drink, mister. I know what you drink.  Voila!
Ummm. It's good.
Lila...
Lila, you don't intend to hurt us, do you?
Now, Puff, we're leaving on the electronic collar. I don't think we'll need to shock you, but just in case.
Humor me, Puff. It's essential that I am able to trust you to function independently in the world.
Extra dessert?
Oh please, is that as articulate as you can be after all the time I spent teaching you? We've discussed Wittgenstein, for Christ's sake. Not that you ever had anything very original or challenging to say on the subject.
And how do you feel about Gabrielle?
It's open...  What'll you have?
All right. Today for me, tomorrow for himself.
You tell me.
Well, Mr. Felson, maybe you could come out to my place some evening. We could play a few games of billiards.
Oh, about five hundred.
Yeah? Why?
Character.
You're damned right I'm sure. Everybody's got talent. I got talent. You think you can play big-money straight pool, or poker, for forty straight hours on nothing but talent? You think they call Minnesota Fats the best in the country just 'cause he's got talent? Nah. Minnesota Fats's got more character in one finger than you got in your whole skinny body.
You bet he knows how.  You think that's a talent too, huh? Knowin' how to drink whisky? You think Minnesota Fats was born knowin' how to drink?
Okay, okay... What do I do now, lie down on the floor and, uh, bow from the ankles? What do I do, go home?
That's your problem.
I told you. I got drunk.
I never saw you do anything else.
Word's out on you, Eddie. You walk in the wrong kind of place and they'll eat you alive.
Now, when did you adopt me?
Thinking about what?
Miss Packard. How do you do?
He's a gentleman. Gentleman gambler. He gets his kicks playing with hustlers. He's got an old Southern mansion with a pool table in the basement, drinks eight-year-old bourbon, smokes cork-tipped cigarettes.
Means I got confidence that he's a loser. All the way a loser. You happen to be about only one-half loser -- the other half, winner.  I'm finished.
Well, rack up your cue. We're leavin'.
You want me to tell her for you?
You gotta be hard, Eddie.
And just how do you figure that, Bert? What do you figure I owe you?
Fifty per cent?
Yep. Fastest and the bestest... Hey, give us another round, will ya? One for him, one for yourself.
Why?
Nobody can make that shot and you know it. Not even a lucky lush.
Fats, let's you and I shoot a game of pool for a thousand dollars a game.
Preacher, go on down and get me some breakfast, will ya? Egg sandwich and a cup of coffee. You want something, Charlie?
Get with what?
A son.
Yeah, to play Fats again.
Yeah. Just like that.
A little, although I'm afraid I generally lose.
What time?
Yeah, sure has.
Yeah. Sure.
Okay.
Since four.
Thanks. I will.
Why not? We already know each other's secrets.
Two ships that pass in the night should always buy each other breakfast.
Sometimes I wake up and I can't sleep, not without a drink. The bars don't open until eight. Mack over there has faith in me. When I'm broke, he trusts me. Don't you trust me, Mack?
I'm the emancipated type. Real emancipated.
I drink.
No.
You told me.
At school. It's Thursday.
Take your choice. I've got enough so we won't have to go out of the house till Tuesday.
Oh, it's not bad.
Would he know?
Yes, I'm glad.
I feel pretty.
Oh, I don't know.
I'd know it, Eddie. I'd know. For God's sakes, what are you trying to do to me? I love you.
Please, Eddie, don't beg him.
Yes sir, boy, they, heh, they say that old Fats just shoots the eyes right off them balls.
Yeah. That's right, too.
Yes.
Where you lived with them.
Yes.
What do you mean?
I know it.  What do you want, Robert?
I don't know.
Virginia...?
Please.
Only got one kind.
You built things.
You'll meet new friends.  I know ... it's rough.  But I have to move, son.
That's Mars.  The closest planet to us, now.  That's why it's more than just a point in the sky.
Where's your car?
You did?  Why? Where were you? They said you left hours ago. We were worried.
George, you're acting very strangely.
He was upset with moving, I believe.
I understand, Miss, that you have my son in your office.
May I ask why?
Children often have trouble adjusting to a new school.
I don't know what he's told you --  What <u>has</u> he told you?  Would you like to tell <u>me</u> -- ?
I don't have many friends.  Dad's all the time moving.
I don't see anything.
The State Police.
I don't know.  I don't know what I'm doing here --
No, Mom.  It wasn't a plane.
What kind, Mom?
Why, yes.
All right.  I'll be right back.
We're going with you. I mean, we're going too.
If we do, we'll both die virgins. But at last we'll be together.
It's not paranoia. The embedding is very subtle. It's probably been overlooked...
I can't leave. We have to tell this to the President.
Then get them out of there.
Think. It's like in chess. First you strategically position your pieces. Then, when the timing's right. You strike.
All I'm saying is they've got people who handle these things, David. They want HBO, they'll call you.
This, pops, is every phone book in America.
Yes. I can use he signal to triangulate her exact position in the White House.
What'd I say?
It's not me. They're overriding the system.
And our troops here?
We're trying to communicate with them on all frequencies but we're getting nowhere. Atlantic Command is working on a type of visual communication.
Mr. President, we must launch. A delay now would be more costly than when you waited to evacuate the cities!
They cancelled it. Why are you acting like this?
I'm a dancer.
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
If we don't strike soon, there may not be much of an America left to defend.
Yes.
People are dying out there. I don't think "exciting" is the word I'd choose to describe it!
Many worlds...
Die.
Oh, yes, of course. But where are we going?
I don't know. But whatever it is, he's in over his head!
I don't know. But someone must want it pretty badly.
Call Donovan, Marcus. Tell him I'll take that ticket to Venice now.
Your father would know. Your father did know. Look. He made a map.
But don't you see? The pen is mightier than the sword.
The Name of God...
Don't take that tone with me, my good man. Now buttle off and tell Baron Brunwald that Lord Clarence MacDonald and his lovely assistant are here to view the tapestries.
Every man's dream.  Including your father's, I believe.
Just the same, an attempt to recover the Grail is currently underway.
I usually don't either.
I said don't go between them!
It's lucky I don't do things the same way. You'd still be standing at the Venice pier.
How do you know?
Where is it? I want it.
Elsa, don't cross the Seal. The Knight warned us not to take the Grail from here.
Out!
It's important!
I got it and I used it. We found the entrance to the catacombs.
Well, what was left of him.
If only I could have been with you.
Yeah, big ones. What do the Nazis want with you Dad?
Look, can we discuss this later?
Brody's this way.
Oh, yes. But I found the clues that will safely take us through, in the Chronicles of St. Anselm.
I don't know. The first available flight out of Germany.
Relax.
When?
This could be close.
Penitent. Penitent...
The penitent man is humble...
Junior?! Dad...
Ready.
Ah, they set out across the desert this afternoon. I believe they took Mister Brody with them.
No camels!
My father was looking for the Holy Grail. Did you kill him too?
If you don't let go, Doctor Jones, we'll both die.
Who are you?
As I said before, we'd be happy to escort you to Delhi.
No. But I am interested in the occult. And this is a kryta.
You should have been there...
His Highness has not yet taken a wife.
When they lost this rock their fields and animals died. They also said their children were taken from them.
Dr. Jones -- I want Nurhachi.
Sure, Indy -- three tickets! You, me and Wu Han --
Nobody's perfect. The way I heard it, you stole one of them from a small village.
Hasn't the Pankot palace been deserted since the Mutiny of 1857?
Poison never agrees with me.  Pull a right, Short Round, and head for the Wang Poo bridge!
The old man saw it in a dream.
Stark naked? You wish... If you're trying to seduce me, Dr. Jones, this is a very primitive approach.
Me seduce you? Honey, you're the one who took your clothes off.  I just came over to remind you that you never know what else might be in the water.
Somehow I feel safer in here.
That's good -- you're doing fine.
Maybe...
Wearing your jewels to bed, princess?
There's got to be another way out.
It's still a long way to Delhi. Who knows what might happen.
I know you did!
Don't do that.
What street?! We're walking down QUEER STREET. We coming to Dopey Drive. We're about to be put somewhere quiet where they won't mind that we talk to ourselves.
Right.
Kind of an oversight, wouldn't you say.
I told you, my name is Al.
I don't know what you're talking about.
The Nicholson Node. I suppose you haven't heard of that either.
I just went there for a job.
Hear voices don't I.
Oh...Gooood!
Thanks.
Why don't you just get out, leave me alone.
Door's locked.
Just walk down the hall?
What does it say.
Is it familiar? Have you been here before.
They think we're safe here. They don't really need us. They're probably long gone.
I don't wanna be you. I wanna go home.
I'm at the airport.
Not who. A data bank. Just keep your ear to the phone and don't make a sound.
It's attitude...how you carry yourself.
Eating sushi?
What is it?
The sand.
What was?
But, you've got to have... sophistication ...savoir faire.
Doesn't.
The beautiful one.
That's a big if.
I don't know what's going on.
Can't tell. Every time I try her, you look away. Or you make noises. Maybe you don't want to know.
This just won't work.
You shut down your sensors.
Better. I found Ryuji.
I told you, I have a feeling...

You were with GRUNER!
Not sure at all.
Cash.
While he makes the run.
He didn't. He left us that walkman chip to confuse us. Would have kept most people busy. We were too fast for him.
Dieter!
Well, don't let it. What are you doing?
What exactly?
I was wrong. She tried to help us get away.
I want to thank you for what you've done.
I'll get us out of here.
That's nice.
Face it, we're the men for the job. Besides, if someone is really chasing you, the best way to avoid them is to keep moving ...and FIND THE GODDAMN PEM.
In my own way...I want you to know that...I love you.
ya hyutn slulptsa?
Rene?
Who's our little man?
I dyed it. We're all getting old.
They took the tapes.
You have nothing...
Surveilliance on them all.
It's the least we can do. After all, it's our responsibility.
He's not an ordinary man.
You remind me of someone. You from the west coast?
Well...I try to give them whatever they want.
What?
Oh...that's okay.
I feel fine.
Not...complaining, actually.
Been hearing voices.
I noticed you staring.
Just give me the keys.
Sir?
What?
...I'm looking for someone.
No. No one to speak of.
Where?
What way?
You did.
...Naw. Made that up.
No. Ryuji just hires us.
Hires you for what?
They left. I had to go with them.
You work for Ryuji?
Get your things.
You think I'm like that?
They'd never talk in front of me. They'd walk away up the beach. Nervous about something.
Dieter's gone to shoot a still job. Hong Kong.
Looks like they can. What did they do?
Why?
They can hold us here forever. Nobody knows about us.
Can't you do something?
Aren't you a little optimistic?
I knew it. I told him.
But you did it. It was you.
We've had thefts of our new stuff ...GRUNER deals in this... A big deal is going down now. I went to see if GRUNER had anything to sell. But he didn't make any moves...And when you arrived, he backed off.
I'm sorry. We're running behind. So many applicants...so few jobs... If you'll just have a seat.
A drink...
Thanks.
The experiment. The danger...
That's alright. Just tear it apart.
Yes.
No?
What's new?
Yeah? What for?
There's Dad, on TV.
How long?
You got a deal. 
Oh, I love that stuff.
CBS does not do that. And, you're questioning our journalistic integrity?!
What does it look like I'm doing? I'm editing.
Okay. 
You're getting ahead of yourself. We're all in this together. We're all CBS. We'll find out soon. Thank you, gentlemen.
Catch you later.
Call me back in ten.
You ready...?
I got fired this morning... Where else am I gonna take it?
What's the difference...
What?!
They're pretending it's process. Bullshit, it's foregone.
So, it's a big country with a free press. You can go work somewhere else.
You're not even on this anymore... What do you care?
What "Seven Dwarfs?"
Do you think we could talk about the taping? Tomorrow's taping, just so we can get it out of the way and order...
Lowell.
I think it was a disgrace.
I see a rhetorical question on the horizon.
That's good. That works.  Uh, you know, I want to ask you something... I know it sounds odd... but...
How much would I get paid?
Jump in, quick, c'mon...
How the hell do I know about Brown & Williamson?
You came all the way down here to tell me that?
No.
I believe that? Yes, I believe that.
They get to go home at night. What does it cost these people to do this to us? Nothing?! My girls are crying, so fuck them! I want to tape! I'm done thinking about it.
I'm going to be a witness for them in their litigation. So I'm going to fly to Pascagoula to give a deposition...
B & W may have threatened litigation... CBS is on the block...  But you, I mean, I know how...
No? No, what?
What?
I told the truth... I told the truth.
And I've got to refute every fucking accusation made in this report before The Wall Street Journal runs.  I am trying to protect you, man!
You greased the rails!
I'm on a leave of absence. Forced vacation.
Hello, can you hear me now?
No, you can.  Tell him to get on the fucking phone!
Then hold it off the air until you got that. But I want to go to New York. And I want to go on the record. Right now!
Right.
A delivery device for nicotine.
And you sent the document forward to Sandefur?
I sent the document forward to Sandefur. I was told that we would continue to work on a substitute, we weren't going to remove it as it would impact sales, and that that was his decision.
And on March 24, Thomas Sandefur, CEO of Brown & Williamson had you fired. And the reason he gave you?
"There are times... I wish I hadn't done it. But there are times that I feel compelled to do it..." "I've -- if you asked me if I would do it again or if it's -- do I think it's worth it. Yeah. I think it's worth it."
Object to the form!
We'd better go before we get thrown out.
And without it, that party is exposed -- a sitting duck. No wriggle room.
I'd just like to have a word with her.
Why not? I'm going to have her for a lifetime.
Who's the pigeon?
Well -- I, uh, that is to say Mr. Dumbarton -- would like you to uh, neutralize a, uh, business associate by the name of Marylin Rexroth Doyle Massey uh Dumbart -- uh, Massey.
What the hell is Botox?
Thanks, buddy.
Rex just had a massive coronary. In the middle of a business meeting. He's dead.
He manufactures staples and industrial brad-tacks. He's very successful.
Not according to Mrs. Rabinow.
Well, don't look at mine!
But why him?
I figure a couple of months. That's how long it should take for the ink on the settlement to dry.
A little.  You get out of the car. That's right, Fuctard. I'm talkin' to you!
Okay Miles.
No kidding. I'll bet you have some very grateful clients. What'd Rex buy you?
Oh. And that is -- mom?
She didn't love you?
Your mother was.
I'm sorry Miles. You shouldn't listen to me. I'm sure you have a very fulfilling life. I'd better go. I'm depressing.
Thank you for the coffee. It's very robust.
I'm a little embarrassed. I'm not used to losing control with such -- volume.
No... That wasn't right. I want YOU to be MY wife.
No ma'am. I have been asleep all my life up to this moment. Marylin, will you marry me?
Oh Miles!
I think a nursery should be right off the master suite. My parents put mine in the guest house. Apparently they did have a Fisher Price intercom, but my mother turned it off when I was seven months old because I was so --
I'd just like to pick up a few of my things
Are you threatening me, because I'm sure that's a violation of the terms of your bail.
Marylin.
Quite a little shopping spree. How do you spend six figures in less than six hours? Oh, never mind I've seen it before. I've seen everything.
Of Massey Myerson?
I don't know. Ruth kept her cool, but I could tell she was surprised.
I'm dying.
Right.
He has no cynicism or anger. For once I'm not the repository of rage at some other woman.
Yes?
Oh, just a routine mammogram. She said to say hello. She's going to Positano with your brother's family.
At this point my client is still prepared to consider reconciliation.
Heh heh.
Why not a hundred and fifty percent?
Kirshner does not apply. Kirshner was in Kentucky.
Rephrase. Mrs. Rexroth, have you ever been in love?
Marylin was friends with Howard and Amanda Doyle. They don't like the way you operate. They helped her.
I don't have a pre-nup
Rex, please.
Mm.
So, you propose that in spite of demonstrable infidelity on your part, your unoffending wife should be tossed out on her ear?
Sorry.
She could buy and sell you ten times over.
What...?
I'd stay away from her, Miles.
You were never invited to meet your son-in-law?
Oh. That's her name. Patricia. Like mine. I was Pat and she was Patty. But she changed it after seeing "Some Like It Hot." To Marylin. After Marylin Monroe.
If I didn't I wouldn't be here!  I've got it all itemized. 
I asked you a question. Do you love her?
I won't stand for it! I won't stand for your running my life! Why do you insist on it!
South America.
I'll do it if it takes every penny I've got. I'll do it if I have to bribe that musical comedy Justice of the Peace! I'll do it—if I have to prove that you were dragged in, staggering drunk. You probably were.  Mmm—mmm. This filet mignon is divine!
You only met him once .
Yes. I know. Well, you can help now. I issued a statement yesterday that I've withdrawn my objections. Begging her to come home. I haven't heard from her. Apparently she doesn't trust me.
No?  Say, listen—I've devoted a whole lifetime trying to tame that wildcat. Toughest job I ever tackled. Ever hear of J.P. Clarkson? Biggest man in the country, isn't he? Well, I tamed him . Got him eating out of the palm of my hand. I've browbeaten financiers, statesmen, foreign ministers—some of the most powerful people in the world—but I've never been able to do a thing with her. She's been too much for me. I'm glad you think it's easy.  Now listen—if you'll do what I tell you, perhaps I might develop a little respect for you. You never can tell.
Any others?
Huh?
Now, that's a brilliant answer. Why didn't I think of it? Our conversation could have been over long ago.
Yeah?
Holy Smokes! You'll never get out yourself! Better phone for some help.
Now, listen. I'm in a very ugly mood. I put up a stiff battle for that seat. So if it's just the same to you—  scram.
Are you talking to me?
Yeah. I knew you'd catch on eventually.
What happened?
You're not going to notify my father, are you?
What for?
Oh, I forgot to tell you. I registered as Mr. and Mrs. 
Well, thank you. Thank you very much, but— you've been very kind. 
Oh, this?—I like privacy when I retire. I'm very delicate in that respect. Prying eyes annoy me.  Behold the walls of Jericho![4] Maybe not as thick as the ones that Joshua blew down with his trumpet, but a lot safer. You see, I have no trumpet.  Now just to show you my heart's in the right place, I'll give you my best pair of pajamas.
Don't let it bother you. You're giving it back to me in the morning.
What is it?  Why, it's a toothbrush! Thanks.  You—you had it pressed.
Listen, Brat—I'm going to count to ten. If you're not out of bed by then I'm going to yank you out myself.
Like what?
Where is the shower?
Hurry up and get dressed.
If you didn't waste so much time on that wise-cracking drummer—we'd have been through with breakfast by this time.
Oh. Is that how you met him?
Say, where did you learn to dunk, in finishing school?
Of course you shouldn't. You don't know how to do it. Dunking's an art. Don't let it soak so long. A dip and plop, into your mouth. If you let it soak so long, it'll get soft and fall off. It's all a matter of timing. I ought to write a book about it.
No mushy stuff. I'm running this troupe.
What's the matter?
I don't trust that chatterbox.
I'm following you.
Of course it is.
I don't think there's a "piggy- back" rider in your whole family. I never knew a rich man yet who was a good "piggy-back" rider.
Show me a good "piggy-back" rider and I'll show you somebody that's human. Take Abraham Lincoln, for instance—a natural "piggy-backer."  Where do you get off with your stuffed-shirt family?  Why, your father knew so much about "piggy-back" riding that he—
I don't know about you, but I'm going to give a fairly good imitation of it.
All right! Don't take them off. Do whatever you please. But shut up about it.
Uh-huh. Want one?
When you get up to a hundred, wake me up.
Just a road thief. Picks people up and runs off with their stuff. What a racket! 
Me?
I would. But I've got a weak stomach.
Eight o'clock! Why, that's twelve hours!
Oh, thank you. Thank you.
Why, he'll be back.
Sorry—I didn't mean to—
Oh, excuse me. 
What!  Say, listen you!  When you get back to New York, take my advice and stay f-a-r away from this office—unless you don't care what happens to that funny map of yours. 
Yes.
Wait a minute, Gordon—I—
If it's on the level.
Yeah, where am I?
Thanks, Joe.
A trumpet?
But what in the world do they want a trumpet for?
Mush. Mush.
I don't trust him.
Oh!!
Yeah, you'll have to git .
Why—no—
That's all right. I got a couple of machine guns in my suitcase. I'll let you have one of them.
Come on, scram! And stay away from that bus.
Without them, it's going to be near impossible, chief, to prove Shaw's connection to the CIA.  We got the same problem with the governors. All of them.  Reagan in California won't give us Brading, Ohio refuses Orville Townsend, Texas on Arcacha, and Nebraska on Sandra Moffet.
They put the heat on, my man, just like you're doing.  I gave'em anything that popped into my cabeza.  Truth is, I never met the dude.
God's sake, chief.  The President was shot.
Get home my ass.  We're going to the office, have another drink.  I want some company tonight.
Goddammit chief, why would I ever need to look in your files?  I saw enough here this summer to write a book.
I always lock my files.  And you were the only one here today...  What do you mean, you son of a bitch?
You know what I mean.  I saw a lot of strange things going on in this office this summer.  And a lotta strange people.
Senator Long set your boss up, my friend.
Pretty fast, wasn't it.  The way they let him go.
Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw?  The guy who used to run the International Trade Mart?
Yeah.  Clay.  I met him sometime in June of '62 at the Masquerade Bar. Dave Ferrie took me there, for the express reason to meet him.
And that's where you met Oswald for the first time?
At 7:30 Sunday morning?  It's not exactly fresh blood we're sniffing here, boss.
That's gonna be tough.  Nobody's talking.
I don't know, Bill, I just don't know.
Boss, are you calling the President a murderer?
I see... and why are you experiencing this paranoia?
Dave?
I'm a dead man!  From here on, believe me, I'm a dead man.
Yeah.  Come on, Dave, come on our side.  I guarantee you the boss'll protect you...  Dave?
They're Agency, too.  Don't you get it?  CIA and Mafia together.  Trying to whack out the Beard.  Mutual interests.  They been doing it for years.  There's more to this than you dream.  FBI fucking hates the CIA.  Navy Intelligence got something to do with it too.  Check out "Alan Pope" in Miami.  Jack Youngblood. Bill Harvey.  Colonel Roselli.  The shooter, I hear, was a Dallas cop - the bagman at Ruby's club.  I heard he shot his own partner.  Got that? Check out the rich fucks in Dallas. H.L. Hunt.  He's dirty.  That's all I know.  But the Agency always runs the show.  Check out something called "Mongoose"  Operation Mongoose. Government, Pentagon stuff, they're in charge, but who the fuck pulls whose chain who the fuck knows, fun 'n' games man - check out Southeast Asia - that's the next big number - the heroin trail.  "Oh, what a deadly web we weave when we practice to deceive."
That's not true.  I never met anybody named Oswald.  Anybody who told you that has to be crazy.
No... if he did, I don't remember him.  There were lots of kids in and out... y'know.
Oh, it was just a spur of the moment thing...  the storm wasn't that bad.
I believe the boys got a couple.
Yes, now I remember, Mr. Garrison. I'm sorry, I got confused.  We got out there near the geese and it was only then we realized we'd forgotten our shotguns.  Stupid, right?  So of course we didn't get any geese.
You think I was a getaway pilot for the assassination, don't you?
Everybody!  The Agency.  The Mob. The Cubans.  Yeah, follow the Cubans. Check them out.  Here, in Dallas, Miami.  Check out a guy named Eladio del Valle.  My paymaster when I flew missions into Cuba - he's somewhere in Miami.  You're on the right track.
Black, black - just give it to me.  Shit.  I'm so exhausted.  My neck is killing me.  I've got cancer.  Had it for years.  I been working with mice, y'know, trying to come up with a cure.
Oh man, why don't you stop.  This is too fuckin' big for you!  Who did Kennedy?  It's a mystery wrapped in a riddle inside an enigma.  Even the shooters don't fuckin' know!  Don't you get it yet?  I can't be talking like this.  They're gonna kill me. I'm gonna die!  I don't know what happened.  All I wanted in the world was to be a Catholic priest - live in a monastery, study ancient Latin manuscripts, pray, serve God.  But I had this one terrible, fatal weakness.  They defrocked me.  And then I started to lose everything.
Dave, it's going to be okay.  Just talk to us on the record and we'll protect you.  I guarantee it.
No, because there were others.  There were admirals.
There were admirals.
What?
That's something, Jasper.  What is it?
He kept trying to get me to change my story about the shots.  He was getting hot under the collar, and telling the woman not to write when he wanted.
...which is strange 'cause this is less than 20 minutes after the assassination.
Makes sense - he's a spokesman.
Presumably so he can now exercise his intellect stacking school texts at $1.25 an hour.
I wouldn't imagine where.
No.
A Willie O'Keefe?
It says that this company has heavily Fascist ties to the French secret army organization that tried to assassinate de Gaulle in 1960.
Nonsense.  What next?
Mr. Garrison, you're reaching.  I am an international businessman.  The Trade Mart which I founded is America's commercial pipeline to Latin America.  I trade everywhere. I am accused, as are all businessmen, of all things.  I somehow go about my business, make money, help society the best I can and try to promote free trade in this world.
No, people like you don't have to, I guess - people like you walk between the raindrops.
Honey, go back to sleep, please!
Tough day.
My sympathies.
We waited for you... hours, Jim. You could have telephoned, for God's sake.  It's Easter!  You promised, Jim.
How do you know?  How do you even know what goes on in this house anymore!  You're too busy making speeches, stirring up every crazed Klansman in Louisiana after us!
Jim, before this Kennedy thing, nothing mattered to you in this life more than your children.  The other night Jasper tried to show you a drawing.  You didn't even notice he was there.  He came to me bawling his little eyes out.  Jim, he's sensitive - he needs more from you.
Is it such a chore?  I don't understand you.
Damn it, if I say I'll spend more time with him, I'll spend more time with him.  I can't fight you and the world too, Liz.
Oh no!  No!  I can't believe it.  I can't believe it.  Both of them, both brothers, oh my God!
No one's trying to buy you, Willie. It's important to know why you're telling us this.
You wanna know why?  'Cause that mother fucker Kennedy stole that fuckin' election, that's why!  Nixon was gonna be one of the great Presidents 'til Kennedy wrecked this fuckin' country.  Got niggers all over the fuckin' place asking for their rights, where do you think we got all this fuckin' crime now, 'cause Kennedy promised 'em too damned much. Revolution comin'.  Fascism's coming back.  I tell ya this - the day that Communist sumbitch died was a great day for this country.  I jes' hate to think they're blaming it on some silly fuckin' Oswald who didn't know shit anyway.  People should know why that sumbitch was killed.  'Cause he was a Communist.  Put me on the stand, go ahead, I'll tell the same goddamn story, I'm proud of it, don't matter fuck all to me, things don't change.
Boss, the President's been shot.  In Dallas.  Five minutes ago.
Upstairs.  In 1963 that was the Office of Naval Intelligence - And just by coincidence, Banister, before he was FBI, was ONI.  What do they say?
The key is the second and third shots came right on top of each other, and it takes a minimum 2.3 seconds to recycle this thing.  The other problem is there was a tree right there...  Blocking the first two shots at the time they occur in the Zapruder film.
No.
Head of the CIA since '53.  Kennedy fired them both.  Cabell was his deputy for nine years.  Talk about the fox investigating the chicken coop.  Now we'll have to subpoena them, Lou.
Well, if I am, why is the Government concealing evidence?
I haven't yet.  I don't have much of a case.
You didn't get that break you needed, but you went as far as any man could, bubba.  What can I do for you?
And he never hit you before?
I don't know if I should talk about this.
Often?  He practically lived there. It was real cloak and dagger stuff. They called it Operation Mongoose. The idea was to train all these Cuban exiles for another invasion of Cuba. Banister's office was part of a supply line that ran from Dallas, through New Orleans to Miami, stockpiling arms and explosives.
Bertrand.  Clay Bertrand?
Clay Bertrand.  He's in the Warren Report.  He tried to get Oswald a lawyer.  Was Kennedy ever discussed, Jack?
Less than you would guess.  Most days two to three assistant D.A.'s. A handful of police investigators.
And what would I have to do?
Stop your investigation... it was a magnificent effort but it's over and done with.  The press is already on your behind and that's only the beginning, my boy, only the beginning.
Virginia.
Virginia, you're a lucky little girl. Your daddy has entered you in a beauty contest.  Would you like to be in a beauty contest?
Uh huh.
But if I am eliminated there won't be any way of knowing.  Consequently a whole new form of government is going to take over this country, and I know I won't live to see you another time.  My life is in danger here. Do I sound screwy?
Well I don't know what can be done, Mr. Ruby, because I don't know what you anticipate we will encounter.
Won't forget?
That's why they call it "fuckin' with ya." Now you wanna hear how we retaliate?
Well, it ain't so much a problem a a situation. Remember I sold those three M-60 machine guns outta the five I got?
Go ahead.
I ain't gittin' in that trunk.
I wanna help you, but I don't wanna be locked in the trunk of no car.
Course you didn't.
What's she willing to give us?
Sure.
I'm tellin' you, I don't know nothin' about that fuckin' shit.
Help you get Ordell Robbie.
What's her name?
In cash.
We could stop at the Hilton by the airport.
Great.
I am, as a matter of fact.
So far I've been told I can cooperate and get probation, maybe. Or, I can stand mute and get as much as five years. Does that sound right?
What did they want to know?
I didn't?
Yeah, if I cooperate.
I am. Have a seat.
It looks nice.
Who is this?
'76?
Well, if the A.T.F. guy is the one who wants you, that'll only interest him up to a point.
Why?
Same way I been doin', but first they got to let me go back to work.
I ain't goin' to jail, and I ain't doin' that probation thing again.
You're not old. You look great.
Yeah.
How was it?
How old's Annette?
I go back to work tomorrow.
No harm in that. He's a young guy havin' fun being a cop. I know the type, trust me on this. He's more interested in Ordell than the money. If he's gonna do anything suspect, it'll be cutting corners to get the conviction; but he wouldn't walk off with the money. It's evidence.
You know where it came from. It's not like it's anybody's life savings. It wouldn't even be missed.
Shoot him with the stun gun. While he's incapacitated, cuff him, take 'em to County.
Did you do it that night?
More or less.
You're takin' a helluva chance kid.
People talk to Winston. He's street, same as them, they trust him. They get busted, they know somebody who can bond them out. I thought I might drop in on him. He'll no doubt be surprised to see me.
Why?
Yeah, your fee. I had to figure that out, since there wasn't no note.
Did you tell him you were leaving?
Start off in Madrid. Ever been there?
Well, Sheronda, it was nice talking to you.
It isn't enough for Trafficking, but how 'bout Posession with the Intent to Distribute?
How can you help us?
What are you doing?
A Broadway shopping bag.
This afternoon before I came here. He was with Ordell at an apartment in Hermosa Beach. I don't know if he lives there, but I can find out.
You talk to him?
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
I got there early. I've had my eye on this suit -- Wait, let's start over. I got there early. The idea was to try on the suit, see if I liked it. If I did, get them to wrap it up, and change back into my uniform. That's what Sheronda's expecting me to wear. Go meet Sheronda, give her the bag with fifty thousand, and go home.
But you didn't do that.
I didn't see him. I was in my underwear. If it was a white guy, it was probably Louis. He kill Melanie?
We were, and we lost him. He walked into a strip bar sometime around three thirty and never came out. The bar was on Ninth, less than a mile- and-a-half from where Louis was found dead. It looks like Louis's friend shot him twice at point blank range.
I have no evidence of your taking anything. You didn't pay for your snazzy new suit with marked bills; I was glad to see that. You've been helping us out, you gave us Melanie and Louis. Melanie had a packet of marked bills stuffed in her shorts when they found her, which goes a long way backing up your story.
You already knew that?
Do you got something for me?
Sure.
And they asked if I knew Mr. Walker.
Baby, I didn't --
It's okay. I forgive you. Now, let's say if I tell on you, I walk. And if I don't, I go to jail.
All your money's in Mexico.
I do okay.
The next trip, when I come with all the money, it'll look like I hand it to the same one I did before...
I suppose you see a piece of this for yourself?
That's an agent. Manager's get fifteen percent.
Who?
How do you know she did that?
Not when it's my ass on the line you don't. We do this my way or fuck it.
Are you sure she don't know about the money?
I told her this is a game us rich folks play, exchanging gifts. Like a scavenger hunt. She didn't know what that was neither.  No answer?
She saw you with Sheronda. So Simone goes to the dress department with her Robinson's/May bag.
I'm gonna be sittin' at the titty bar In downtown L.A. till my man over here calls me and gives me the O.K. sign.
I'm impressed. He knows a lot.
What for?
Yeah.
We had done time together already.
C'mon, don't lie.
You lived in Japan, when?
That's what I been tellin' you. Start adding these motherfuckin' figures up, and you tell me this ain't a business to be in.
You didn't even hafta say it. I know the woman.
I told you, man.  She my fine little surfer gal.
That's what I got to talk to you about. You see, Melanie was giving me a hard time --
So you're sure she's dead.
Look, that's the bag she came out with. She never even put her hand in it, and neither did I.
Where you shot her.
Or...  ...she gave it to somebody else first, before Melanie went in the dressing room.
You know who I saw in the dress department?
I'm going to Del Amo, see a movie, get something to eat.
Whatever looks best and starts the soonest.
Gonna have to put up cash.
Livingston, huh?
Ordell Robbie. O-R-D-E-L-L. R-O-B-B- I-E. 1436 Florence Boulevard. Compton 90222.
Beaumont ain't going nowhere.  Where do I sign?
I got some more business for ya.
You didn't hear?
The stewardess. Do you know her last name?
That's what the police thought. I told them I'm unemployed, how could I have anybody work for me? Now I bail out Jackie, I'm liable to have the police on me again, huh? Wanting to know was she doing things for me, was she bringing me that money!
Jackie ain't got time for all that shit --
Looky here, I know you helped her and I know you know what I want. Jackie can tell me any story come in that pretty head of hers. Long as at the end of that story, she hands over my money. She do that, we're still friends. Now, she don't wanna be my friend no more, tell her to think about ol' Louis. And if she tries to turn me in, I'll name her ass as my accessory. We'll go upstate together. Hand in handcuffed hand. Now that shit's a promise, understand what I'm sayin'? You tell her that, and I'll call you back.
I thought you might be asleep.
Uh-huh.
Lift up your pant leg. You help her?
She wanted to see me, why wasn't she home?
That I gotta see.
Call her, tell her the combination.
If she wanted to set you up, you'd be in custody right now. When you said you'd name her as an accessory she believed you. That scares her more than anything.
I know where it is.
Now, is there anything you want to tell me before we get out of this car?
Yes.
It's Beaumont.
I was gonna tell you...
He leave town?
Take me home.
I'm okay.
Hey, you're talkin' about Paul. Who'd want to hurt him?
Oh God!
Daddy. Let go.
It's short, huh?
There's nothing to expose.
What are you talking about?
It's cold.
The army. The army. What is it with you guys? We're not talking about a trip to the library here. This is the United States Government for God's sake. This is red tape coming out of your ass. You know what I mean?
Then why aren't you teaching? Why aren't you in a university?
Something's going on here. You're not telling me something. What the hell's gotten into you?
I talked to the Army's Bureau of Records. You've never even been to Viet Nam.
I don't have to do any such thing. I'm eating my lunch, okay?
No. Not really ...
I was absent the day they taught that in school. What did she say?
She talk about the boys?
You should go back to her.
If it was any other brain but yours, I might agree. Relax, this is going to be strong.
You ever read Meister Eckart?  How did you ever get your Doctorate without reading Eckart?  Good. Okay, let's turn over gently. Right side.
Jake, you need to rest.
Have you considered a doctor? A psy- chiatrist?
It's not healthy with it closed.
This is healthy? I'll probably die of pneumonia tomorrow and this is healthy.
The room!
I don't know.
Eli. Why can't you remember their names?
They're weird names.
I must have been out of my head.
Kids on a joy ride. Happens all the time.
How high is that?
The numbers stop at 107.
That's your decision.
You're red hot, damn it. Get in there. I've got to get more ice.
Hey, I'm not dressed.
While you were in the shower.
Please.
Reasonable? Reasonable? Jake ... You're gettin' me angry.
Wake up. Stop playing with yourself. It's finished.
You look upset.
I'm not bugging you. Come and lie down. I'll give you a massage.  Where'd you go today?
Where's West? New Jersey?
I always liked the West, west of Il- linois anyway. But you gotta give me time to pack.
Yeah, sure. We were losing the war.
A couple of days later. It was fierce. You guys never saw it.
I don't know.
One drop?
Better living through chemistry, that's my motto.
I'm sure. You've got nothing but troubles waitin' for you here.
You got a nice tan, though.
Help me!
For what? For seeking the truth?
Help me!
Last night! They were as real as you are!
Speaking.
Paul Gruneger! Well I'll be goddamned!
You and everybody else. God I hate this area. Makes me nervous.
You can't talk in Brownsville?
What's goin' on Paul?
What is it Paul? What's happening to me?
The army?
Last month, before Thanksgiving.
He's melting it as fast as we dump it in.
Punk?
You got lucky.
You got lucky. I could have waited until he ate your head.
Speaking of which, duck!
Yes it does.
Alright, asshole.
We're not leaving Crutch!
Delongpre! Out of time!
Yeah, yeah.  Well, what have you got to say for yourself?
Thorgan, pull us in.
I'm coming, I'm coming.
What are you doing back?!!
Two more charges to go.
Hey, easy now.
What if they're carrying? Did you even check?
Right now, I care only for the safety of this crew. You don't know anything about these two -
Weapons? All this technology and what good has it done?!
Space Lab?! Wait'll I get my hands on Yllo.
Med-kit?
What if we don't?
That's a good fantasy, though. Kinky, but good.
Were you close to your father?
I'm stuck!
Oh great...yeah, having a great time, and you?
I've waited long enough. Kay . . . you know what to do.
Shit! Temp's dropping! We should have left this rock an hour ago!
Let's just get out of here.
A little late to be thinking about escape, isn't it?
Would you?
Jesus! Can't you knock?  Diminish power to shutttle Beowulf.
Teleportation? Some way to beam us the hell out of dodge?
Somebody wanted the place to stay hidden.
Yes, I've reprogrammed you. You are very brave. Bad ass.
Don't worry about me. I live for this shit.
I am now. I missed you, Thorgan.
I missed you too.
Get your ass back to the shuttle. I'll check it out.
This is a science excursion corporal. Just stay out of the way.
Thirty seconds.
Trust me. I'm bypassing regular channels. See what kind of payday we're looking at.
If you're for real, you're looking at a million credits for viewing rights alone. Doesn't include touring and guest lectures. When can you get them here?
Obviously so.
That's right, now if you could...
Of course he is. He's the most relevant find in 400 years...except for you, of course. Look if you're worried about PR don't be. You're walking and talking.  He's a stiff. You'll get the publicity.
Are we locked down?
Rizzo, a shuttle out in the middle of space? We'll die oout there.
You got it.
What I do is trick him to the surface, got that? Then I can jab him, understand?  Think I'm gonna haul it in as if he's a catfish, like everyone else does?
We got a barrel on him. We can't lose him. We stay out here until we find him.
Michael! Come inside!
Excuse me, but what are you talking about? Didn't they catch the shark this afternoon? It was on the Cape station news.
Can you do that?
Do I need any more authority?
I was only reacting to what I was told.
I think we all owe a debt of gratitude to these men for catching this monster.
Be reasonable, boys -- this isn't the time or the place to do some kind of half-assed autopsy on a fish. Ben...  do you have all the pictures you need?
Let's all get out of here, this place stinks.
I'm going home.
What kind of a shark did you say it was?
I don't thing either of you is familiar with our problems...
Why?
Yeah. Like the kid on your beach. I wish I could've examined that shark they caught...
There's a kind of a lone shark, called, uh...
They must've hit something.
That means closing the beaches.
Y'know, I used to hate the water...
Somebody could've -- I was sort of passed out.
Some friends and me took a house.
Pretty stiff.
Twenty years.
Yep.
I just wanted to know if you were all right... the Coast Guard let me use their radio. Is Chief Brody there?
He's busy.
I've got all these signs here...
Transplants?
Who's inside, you or the shark?
25 feet. And three tons of him there.
Ever see one like this?
But it's breakfast for supper. Your favorite, Paulie. I made French toast and sausage. Patties, not linkies, just like you like it.
Okay, cool.
Yeah. Um, I hooked up a whole private adoption thing. These married people in Saint Cloud are going to be the parents.
Is that normal?
I totally heard you did.
I don't. Katrina smells like soup. Her whole house smells of soup.
Well at least you don't have to walk around with the evidence under your sweater. I'm a planet!
Why?
Because they're your fave. And you can never have too much of your favorite one-calorie breath mint.
You know it's okay.
Oh, hey Vijay.
Just like our moms and teachers!
Yup.
No, I mean the father! Who's the father, Juno?
But I'm going to give it up for adoption. I already found the perfect people.
They said they wanted to know about this stuff. They said to keep them updated, so I did!
I know enough.
You mean I have to wait for it to get even worse? Why can't they just give it to me now?
No Josh, I don't take orders. Not from you and not from any man.
You know, you've been acting like this ever since I went up to see my brother at Mankato. I told you, nothing happened!
Did your wife send you up here to spy on me?
I came over as soon as I got that cold ultrasound goo off my pelvis. My stepmom verbally abused the ultrasound tech so we were escorted off the premises.
I imagine you have a collection of punk chestnuts to prove your point.
Oh God, you're one of those guys...
What?
This isn't what we agreed on. You guys have to take care of... this! You are the chosen custodians of the big-ass bump!
Good. I'm good.  Did you finish that paper for Worth's class yet?
No, not yet. I tried to work on it a little last night, but I'm having trouble concentrating.
I heard that was you.
Sure. The powder room down here is being re-tiled, but you can use the master bath upstairs. Go up, then turn left and on your right...
Look, if I could give it to you now, I would. But it probably looks like a Sea Monkey at this point, so I think we should leave it in there for a while until it gets cuter, you know?
I thought people got all that stuff at baby showers. When my stepmom had my sister I remember she got about a million presents. They were all lame though, so I wasn't jealous.
Elbow.
My dad used to be in the Army, but now he's just your average HVAC specialist. He and my mom got divorced when I was five. She lives on a Havasu reservation in Arizona...
Once! And she didn't die, if you recall!
Well, no... I'm not going to sell the baby. I just want it to grow up with people who are ready to love it and be parents. I'm in high school, dude. I'm ill-equipped.
Tot ice skating? Tots can't ice skate. Liberty Bell's still getting the hang of stairs.
You look a little morose, honey. What's eating you?
Want me to call for you? I called for Becky last year.
Eh, I'll call them myself. But I do need your help with something very urgent.
Nah, it was a premeditated act. The sex, I mean, not getting pregnant.
I couldn't do it, Leah! It smelled like a dentist in there. They had these really horrible magazines, with, like, spritz cookie recipes and bad fiction and water stains, like someone read them in the tub. And the receptionist tried to give me these weird condoms that looked like grape suckers, and she told me about her boyfriend's pie balls, and Su-Chin Kuah was there, and she told me the baby had fingernails. Fingernails!
Maybe they'll totally shit and be super mad at you and not let you graduate or go to Cabo San Lucas for spring break.
Yeah, but it sucks for free.
It is really weird looking. It's like it's not even real. I can't believe there are saps who actually cry at these things.
Right, seriously.
I don't have a choice. Keith's been grading me really hard lately.
There's no way in hell they're having sex or even holding hands.
Yeah, well, Bleek trusted me. We're best friends.
Prom is for wenises, anyway. Once you're old enough to go, it's not cool anymore.
Yes. Heating and air conditioning.
I didn't do anything... I just... I've just been thinking.
It all just happened so fast. We put that ad in the paper. I thought it would take months if, you know, ever and then -- boom -- Two weeks later, she's in our living room.
Ever since, it's just been like a ticking clock.
That French ain't it?
Sorry. Boy I'll tell ya, if Early found a picture of me like that I'd be black and blue for a week.
Do what?
Adele... are you serious?
That's not true!
Well Dorothy, why don't you hand me that chili there.
They ain't dangerous Adele. They're writers.
Early, can we stop there... just for a little while.
Thank you for what?  What are you thanking me for Adele?
What do you need a Bible for?
Brian.
How much do I owe you?
Who?
Wonder what all them people done made him so mad?
He almost always killed strangers. Spent years moving on from one place to another. That made it real hard to track him down.
...Then some.
You wanna hear mine?
Ain't you goin' to record it?
Nah... how much money have you got?
What happened to Adele?
Just like that. Load up the Lincoln... point it West... stop when we hit the fucking ocean.
He can't help the way he was raised. I kinda feel sorry for him.
I heard that.
She told me...  ...but only when she "deserves" it. Did you know he was in jail?
Look again!
I can't believe I agreed to do this.
What the fuck is wrong with you Brian!? If you'll stop taking notes for once and open your eyes... you'll see that he is a homicidal fucking killer. He is... for real!
Not yet.
No, never. Excuse me.
He wasn't going to shoot her, you murdering son of a bitch!
Wasn't my fault...
I ain't got nothing against God. It's the people he let come into the world... lot of them should have been stopped at the door. What are you looking for?
Without his car?
Hmm. I'd say eight, maybe nine.
You're clean.
How did she smell? Did her puss stink?
And for a second I felt a little bit guilty. You know, because she's young and all. And then I was like, oh shit, that turns me on. I wanna fuck this little baby girl.
She's probably smash you in the fucking face.
Why?
It's no big deal, right?
Yep.
Three pennies and a ball of lint.
The cartoon?
And it got me thinkin'. How fun it would be to share each other's girl.
I mean I've been with a lot of girls I know.
No. Casper's right. Girls love it. They just act like they don't in front of their friends.
Yeah.
She hangs out at Nasa. She promotes for them.
I'm gonna fuck her tonight. I swear to God I'm gonna fuck her.
That.
Did you look at that guy? What the fuck. He had no legs.  He had no half his lower body. He's gotta shit out of his ribcage.
Why not? You stink.
That shit gives me a rash all under my arms and around my stomach. I like my odor. It's fuckin' natural.
You goin'?
Nuffin' G. Just forget it.
Right now?
Yeah.
Tonight?
But I'm scared Telly.
I don't know. I've never seen any of them before. Cornballs from Jersey on X. Feelin' the effex.
Come on Jennie. You look sad. Just take it.
Of course I do.
A bad day! You wanna hear a bad day? Yesterday my son was smashed over by a car and when my wife found out she collapsed on the floor. She had a minor heart attack. Partial paralysis. But I don't let myself get sad. No way. Not me. It's not good for the soul.
No.
Yeah?
I'm fucking serious. Where's Telly?
Did you bleed?
Come on. Don't cry. We'll work it out.
Have you ever swallowed it before?
Right. You know it's not like... You know there's a difference between sex, making love, and fucking!
It's really slow. It's slow boring.
Yeah?
You've heard the stories right?
Holy shit. That's all true?
No. I was just kidding.
You want a wip-it?
It's grandmother style.
Yeah.
What are you saying?
He says on the photo he'll call tomorrow at eleven.  Why not come back then and listen for yourself.
Oh, we'll be back.  You can bet on it.
All you gotta do is look at the map.
His victims aren't random.  It only means that they appear to be random. There's a connection, we just have to find it.
I used to.  With my old man.  He taught me how to hunt and trap.  Trapping's a lot harder than most people think.  We used to go after Raccoons mostly. They'd get into our garbage, our fields.  When an animal can't live peacefully with those around it, it has to be destroyed.  But they're crafty little devils.  You see the trick is, you can put your trap down, but no Raccoon is going come near it unless you lay down the scent.  You ever smell Raccoon scent?  Smells like shit, but to a male Raccoon it smells just like pussy.  He'll walk right up to that trap, even though it don't look nothing like a Raccoon and stick his Goddam head right in it.  You know why?  Cause he can't help himself.  The scent drives him.  So, if you want to catch a Raccoon all you gotta do is figure out where he is -- lay down the scent -- and sooner or later he'll walk right into the trap.
If we knew that we'd know the answer to the riddle, wouldn't we?  He's telling us where he's going to kill tonight and we can't see it.
What was your relationship with her?
Find him!  I want to talk to him.
You weren't mad at him for picking up the phone?
Did anyone stand out?
What do you mean, stand out?
Did anyone look suspicious?  Think!
Now that you mention it there was somebody who looked suspicious.
Someone who's going to become an important part of your life.  I want to play a game with you.
What?
Do you know what I'm doing right now, Peter?  I'm looking at the name of the girl I'm going to kill tonight.
Just like who?
I couldn't tell you that.  It would ruin the game.  Not that you're playing it very well.
Very nice speech, Peter.  Did you rehearse that, or was it impromptu?  There's an old wooden bench in the garden.  Next to it is a rock.  You'll find a message for you under it.  Let's see if you're as clever as you think you are.
What word did you leave last night?
You sonofabitch!
The game's over.  You lost.
Don't beg, Peter.  She has to die.  I can't win unless she dies.
They took away the game because of him. My father left and my mother...  There was so much blood... It covered everything.
Oh, I put a few games on for your daughter.  I hope you don't mind.
I just can't believe it.
He already did once.
That's only because you don't know where to go.  You like hiking?  Fishing?  Sailing?  What do you like?
Thanks, David.
Not much.  There's no sign of a break in.  I think she let him in.
Bingo.
I'd say at least eighteen hours.
We're not sure.
What do you think he did?
Well, the fact that he views this as a game suggests that he is trying to prove some sense of superiority -- and the way he murders confirms a need to be in complete control of his victim.
Anything else?
You don't have a shred of evidence!
No.  He was wearing a mask... but I saw the cut on his wrist.  It was Peter.
I can't arrest someone for having a cut on their wrist.  Do you have someone you can stay with tonight?
I've got a room at the institute I use when I stay late.
Only in passing.  To say hello to.
I don't know.  I was afraid there'd be hours of questions.  I can't afford to miss a game.
Could Emma be the name of the girl he's going to kill?
Maybe I already have.
That's all he needs.  He's making the moves.  It's an opening.  I just can't remember the name.  Okay, it's a game.  He's starting it, so he moves first.  He's white.  e2-e4.
Look, I'll do anything you want!  I'll sign anything you want!  Just send a car out to the hotel.
It's over, Peter.  Let's stop the games.  I'm not sending a car.
You don't win by playing it safe, Peter.
Is it serious?
When I was very young.
It seems like such a complicated game.
Sounds very violent.
Chess is a reflection of life.  Life is violent.  The strong win.  The weak perish.
Do you always open quickly?
Does what's going on bother you at all? Or are you just wearing your game face?
Are you going to tell me you didn't feel something in there?
Of course.
Because I work with them.
A fierce magazine... brutal...  An angry magazine... A war magazine... a mercenary magazine...  fierce...  Mad.
Right.  Here!  c-4.
Yeah.  I'll be there later.
There's a girl in the hospital who is going to live because of you.  You made a difference.
I just wanted you to know in case you thought about it in the future.
No, I want you to do good.  That way when I beat you at the end I'll look that much better.
I'm not nervous.
You have the power. <u>Will it</u>.
Yes.
You will not follow the Slayers, you will obey my command!  You have no chance alone, boy. You must try to break through to Ynyr. He has great knowledge. Only with his help can you save Lyssa.
I am too old to climb down a rope.
What do you see?
The deeper she goes, the harder it is to contact her. Once she is below the second level, you will not be able to reach her at all.
You will tell me her name and we will go together.
We must enter the swamp.
Yes.
Let me comfort you.
I cannot take comfort when she has none.
I cannot.
<u>What</u>? Oh no! Better it was me. There isn't another good tomato within a hundred leagues.
Fame?  Thank you, no. Fame is the burial ground of contentment. Eat it and go hungry; count it and go broke; seek it and grow mad. Fame is what fools yearn for and wise men shun.
Not sleepy, either?
Those are not child's tear. A child cries for himself, a man cries for those he loves.
Yes, my lord.
Perhaps. If the pay is good.
A <u>boar</u>? Those incompetent louts couldn't catch a piglet, much less a boar.
I am Quell.
I cannot go with you, my friend.
I ...  ... am Titch.
Smart lad.  Bring me my spices!
I'd wish for a puppy.
We have plenty of hares.
I am being exploited! Where are you going?
The forest is not safe these days. You'd best travel with us.
He was aiming a huge spear right at me!
No. He will master the leader.
Freylag's stronghold?
It is the way of all invaders. Those they would conquer they divide, buying allies with promises of land and power.
It is important to assure the succession.
A fine match.
We will have to try again. His knowledge is great. Without it, we cannot hope to win.
The new King.
It is the time.
They will fail for, during the day, the power of the Circle is greater than theirs. Only at night can they pierce the Circle.
It is not necessary. They will not follow.
She was not as beautiful.
She bore you many children?
Where is he? My son.
I killed him when he was born.  This place is my punishment.
Those are reflections.  <u>This</u> is my face!
...Office 2702.
Huh!? Because of the slaughter at your same floor?
Dirty work, and I kill no women and no kids.
Yeah... Well... I don't know.. I don't know any.
I'll explain you, Leon: they'll ask you to fill in a lot of forms and you can't write and they'll ask you your job, your employer's name and you can't tell them: My job, I'm a hitman and my employer is Tony, his record is longer than his resturant's menu.  That's why you can't have a bank account!
Quick doesn't mean "ready". And you can't discuss, we said. Right?
...This is what I don't like, you see: you don't refrain me, but at the same time I can't get out!
Why?
When I say I love you.
I love you too, and I don't want to lose you.
...Yes. The day he got out of jail. I allowed him to make ten steps... No more. And bang. Two hundred meters. By telescope. That night, I left my country and came here, to join my father, who worked for Tony.  ...I was 17. Then, I never left the city...  And never had another girlfriend...
It will take them five minutes!  How long ago did they arrive?
Not at all, Mathilda! I tell you because it's true! You'll buy the globe you told me about and you will choose, OK? We'll go where you want! I swear, you'll see, Mathilda!!
Huh! You made an error, baby.  I don't know any Danielle.
Can I sit on the stairways now?
Messina.
Huh? Are you Alfredo's son, then?
It's a specialty down there.  It's a fishing boat with, in front, a long pole near the surface. Then, near the cabin, a very tall mast with a little cabin for the lookout.
I respect your business, Mister Tony. Every time we asked your help, we were very happy with the result.  It's right this that makes me nervous, now.  I hope you'll excuse my temporary bad mood?
Where?
Why am I such an authority?
What are the odds?  Do I have a fifty-fifty chance of surviving the operation?
Pardon?
Face it Ellen, I'm not the type of person who reads bedtime stories. But you love me anyway.
Out of the car.  He jumped out of the god damn car!
I'm Isaac... I'm three.
Yeah!
Right.  But everyone saw how small Isaac was and laughed... but not Big Billy.  He stared at Isaac carefully and then told him to join the game.  It came to the end of the game.  It was the eleventh or twelfth inning or whatever is the last inning of a game...
Never have children.  If they're not a burden to you, they're a burden to someone else.
Tomorrow.
She knew you loved her.
So I've been informed.
What Mr. Parker?
You were right.  From the heart is always better.
What, come on?
Where am I?
In a hospital.
Did you tell him everything you wanted to?  Did you do everything you could while he was here?
He wants to reward you... That's why I'm here.
I mean you've done a great thing. You should be rewarded monetarily.
No.  I won't take it unless I pay for it... Let's see, that's a pretty nice watch -- I can see that.
Orange soda?
Water?
I guess I do too.
No, just drunk... but that's OK. Where's your car?
I sold it this morning. I'm going to take cabs from now on in.
Of course. Wow... you look extremely beautiful.
Don't know. My watch went the way of the car.
Is that really what you want to ask me?
Interesting choice of words. I don't remember. I just know that I want to.
That's astonishing. Sera, look...
Three nights, two days. When is your rent coming up at the motel?
So... I'm not too concerned with long term plans.
Don't be silly?
Seriously, Ben... I need to keep pretty low-key around here. Maybe next time you could nap this side of the door. That was the landlord.
Well, then... I hope we don't run into any tonight.
I told them you were an alcoholic and I would take you home. I also promised that we would never come in there again.
Can we just ignore it?
Thank you, Sera.
Yeah... I'd like that.
OK.
Suits. I didn't tell them anything. You know anything about gears?
I've been all right.
Like I said... it was a slow night... I'm sorry. It was hard to score.
Yuri... are you...
I don't need backups. Harvard is the school I'm going to.
You understand you're on trial for murder?
I'll take that as a no.
Was there any reason for you to believe she had discarded a weapon?
Was there any evidence that Mrs. Windham shot him?
Not that I saw. But like I said, I went straight upstairs to take a shower.
No, she'd stashed it by then.
No. I was in the shower.
You're a beautiful girl, Elle.
I saw Mrs. Windham standing over the body of Mr. Windham.
That's terrible!
She could use some mascara and some serious highlights, but she's not completely unfortunate-looking.
Which must be a nice vacation for his balls...
Uh -- family.
What?
Maybe you should sleep with the judge too. Then we can win the case.
And Donovan's a scumbag for coming on to you.
You guys are so sweet!
Speak up in Donovan's class. He likes people with an opinion. Sit in the back for Royalton. He tends to spit when he talks about products liability.
But maybe it's not what you think.
How do you figure?
And you know this for a fact?
If she were a true blonde, she would've left the cheating bastard. Blondes don't let their husbands get fellated by brunettes and live to tell about it.
What do you think?
You're applying for my internship, aren't you?
She could make you drop three pounds in one class. She's completely gifted!
There's a pizza welcome lunch in twenty minutes. Does that count?
I guess it'll have to...
So are you!
I feel like we've barely spent any time together since we got here.
A restaurant in Oakland. Where no one would recognize us.
Chuck.
But I guess it wasn't enough for Brooke.
Precisely.  Faith has persuaded them a pygmie with a sling can kill an armed giant.
Purely a precaution...
You go to lady now?
But I'm hideous!
Why have you brought me here?
I'm pleased you're not troubled by the prospect...
Indeed I am, my dear... that makes us a pair!
Later, beloved... Now I wish only to be with you...
Pleasure is for those who seize it! Do you think those insipid, pale- skinned mortals will ever know such rapture?
Now I want to live forever.  I've never felt so strong or happy.
I said, I mean no harm... I thought this as empty tomb.
Cathay?
Dlagon not like that.  Dlagon is spilit of life... spilit of stlength and goodness.
We be honored, friend Ogg.
Gump, is it?
Faerie ring?
No... I... I need to rest.
And if I cannot?
You have me word, lad.  To answer a faerie riddle deserves as much.
What does she want from me?
Please don't misunderstand.  I am grateful for your hospitality and --
Big question that, lad.  Why what?
The colt's still too small.
Whatever for?
Sounds like the bird we want.  All right lads, follow yon raven!
Your imagination runs away with you, Jack... Those bones be but battlefield gleanings, like I mentioned.  A wee bit of carrion to frighten off the uninvited.
Here is a bold champion's reward; to serve as a dwarf's doorstop.
Heading true north.  We continue in that direction.
Nay.  This time we strike first!
But seem to have gotten lost on the way.
It's your own fear troubles you... We're here, aren't we?  For all the dark magic protecting it.
It feels wrong, Jack... like a trap.
Aye, so long as you're not too greedy for the bait.
Easily spoken...
That's it!
I could have struck off his head just now!
Not in the mood, I'm afraid.
She lives... isn't that worth singing about?
By the pond.  She was teasing me.
Hush up, Screwball.  Do your own worm-sticking if you like the taste so well.
Gonna make ogre-stew!
Very thrifty.  Even got your arrow back.
Or perchance...
What's the matter?
I've no fear of failure.  Your implications are most unbecoming.
It happened so fast.  He was hurt and ran away.
That's why he goes masked during the day...
Seemed like weeks and weeks.  Such a terrible dream... I could never tell you...
Oona?  Do you suppose it's a faerie?
We seek the ogre, Baron Couer de Noir.  He slew a unicorn and plunged the world into eternal winter.
Exceeding fair.
Twould be to compare one star with another in the summer sky.
I pray God grants it me.
Wondrously so.
A faerie's love makes anything possible.
Achilles wore it before the gates of Troy.
Yes, yes... Jimmy Squarefoot good friend to one and all...
You've been inside?
In a dream.
Oh, honey.  There's not much to do there. I mean, it's all work.
Who are you?
What color?
What's wrong?
Oh...I set it to see if it would work.
Oh God, we don't want the police!
I might not stay, anyway.
No.  That's okay.
I'm sorry.  I'm just here to shower.
Hand me a towel.  Hand me a towel.
It would help me if I could kiss you.
Not if what he left me was real.
Floating to Catalina.
Just, I mean, well, you're here every single day.
It could have been a squirt gun.
A sink?
Pardon me?
how much weight have you lost?
Peter Webber!  Right.  Quite the spotlight on that guy.
Typing and clicking myself to renderings isn't why I started building models.
We were probably in school together.  You went to Berkley?
Oh...do you know when she'll be home?
Thank you.
It's midnight.  What's the matter, Sam?
There are no windows facing my...exposure.
I don't know.
Hey, it beats letting town folk go down on you for the summer.
I know what the deal is.  Josh is a pimp. I'm not stupid.
You have everything?
I almost saw Catalina.
No you don't.
It bugs me.
I'm not doing it!
I'd rather sell my nuts to a castrati.
I don't know.
I might have a solution.
Don't.  I don't want it.
I couldn't imagine how I could compete with him for any part of you.  So, I didn't.  He wanted you to have his last name...I let him even take that.
I'm telling you now.
I'd be in Tahoe having fun if you had given up.
What would you be doing now?
Getting high, I guess.
Why wouldn't she leave?
After everything.
The kind where there isn't really an answer.
I would have lied to me if I thought I'd believe it.
Well, congratulations!  You fucking pulled it off!
Oh.  Sorry.
He doesn't answer.
Why does he have a lock on his door?
Where have you been for a week?!
One of you would end up dead.
Let's go.
Well, for later then.
I used to live here.
It was just that, maybe the way the sun struck the ocean, the sound of the waves. It was simple, whatever it was.  Then I started thinking about the last time I felt this good.  It's been a long time.
Or wound.  Let them keep their eyes and fingers.
It's just that there's less that Adam and Ryan can do anymore.  I'd hate to have them bored.
What is it with this?  They wouldn't spend less time with Peter if they lived here!  He has no time!
I'll say a lot of things I've never said before.  It's habit.
I need to know.
I'm an idiot to have you up there.
Not a perfect day.
Don't even...I'm there.
She wouldn't even fucking go out with until she was sixteen.  I mean, that's not even a rule, just her own thing.  She like figures things out on her own and then that's it.
We should take a vacation.
You can't go with me because of Sam?
Sam is working at something for the first time in his life.  Once in a while he even talks to me.  I want to be around for that.
So am I, Robin.  I'm working at something, too.  I'm even talking.  Do you want to be around for it?
I know.
If I walk out the door, who's gonna be here tonight for the follow through?
Either do you.
You could keep it and rent it out?
This is what he wants.
And the baby?
Cost you a pair of nylons.
Maybe you didn't notice, but this is a prison.
There are ways around that. Right sergeant?
Kid's getting out. I got him a pardon.
Then what's the problem?
Why not?
But I'm not on the outside. I'm in here.
He don't sound like he's from 'round here.
A job, huh? Well, that's nice, real nice. You won't have to work long. I'll be back soon enough. After I start work at First Federal Bank of Manhattan, I'll be keeping you in style. Everything will get back to normal again. That's a promise.
Why would you want to go home? It's so early.
Claude Banks.
You? Dine and ditch, right?  Over ten bucks?  You're probably looking at a thumb.
My daddy is dead so watch your mouth. You can say what you want about me, but don't be dragging my daddy into it. This watch means the world to me. Solid gold. Keeps perfect time.
You're soft.
Hey, man, don't ever call me that.
Yeah, I want some pie.
Let me get this straight. We drove all the way down to Klan country 'cause you heard a couple of guys talking?
What can I say? When the spirit moves me.
He even got my daddy's watch.
He just blocked it out. Nigger's crazy. He's the one who did all the stabbing. He's capable of some heinous shit.  How 'bout him down there?
So?
That's why we won't take the train. Cookie showed me where there's a farm house. They got a boat there.
What do you know about boats? I bet you can't even swim.
No, I don't like it here. Look around. There's nothing but ass. Male ass! Balls and ass! Believe you me, I'm getting out of here.
Well, if you're still thinking about booking it, I want in. I think we can make it.
The appeal was denied. Then Daisy went and fell for Maynard. They're engaged to be married, can you believe that?
What'd you say?
How the fuck are we gonna do that, Ray?!
Of course, he's in the lineup. There he goes right there. Hey, Babe...!
Him?
Can't be worse than any of these other fools.
Let me see that.
Maybe you're fooling yourself, Ray. Maybe you're just a chip off the old block.
I'd have knocked you off those bottles, put a bullet in your ass and be half way to New York right now.
He's just a lonely old man. He likes to talk.
Don't touch that car.
Forget about that. You run if you want to, but you're not taking this car.
No, believe me, I'm gonna kill him!
Tell me about it. Scared me at first. Then, before I could figure out what to do with it, it was gone. Imagine my disappointment.
You don't want to hear it, you don't want to hear it. There's no shame in that.
Listen up, jiggaboo! State of Mississippi ain't interested in your... in your...  metropolitan assets!
I think that old man lost his marbles about a hundred years ago. Come on, let's get this over with.
Of course nobody believed Ray and Claude.
Don't you lie to me, Rayford.  You still have your daddy's watch?  Well, this is all I can give you. I wish it was more.
They gave me life, mama.
It'll be too late.
I believe in treating the convicts with respect, if that's what you mean.
If somebody deserves respect, Mr. Pike, they receive it from me, convict or no convict.
Me? Willie Long.
What are you in for, Willie?
You all been here a long time. Doesn't anybody ever escape from this place?
They'll be sending you up there soon enough. And not just for a visit, neither.
All I need is the front money and a truck. I could be back in two, three days tops if I had somebody to share the driving.
Alright, Ray, you've got a deal. Pick your man and get going.
If I was you, I'd want somebody who can handle himself in a tight spot.
I am concentrating. Where can we rule?
Eventually, Cassius. But first we corrupt as many as we can so that when we do destroy them...
I lowered the drinking age to ten.
I was going to let you out, eventually, Cassius. I swear.
So excited.
An angel?
It was a long time ago, at some Heaven and Hell mixer.
I also have this odd pain in my mid section. Kind of a hollow feeling...
Put it in your mouth.
I think we have to work on narrowing down our list of suspects. Now I'm going to go check in with some of my contacts uptown.
The shit has hit the fan, kid. Take a look.
In exchange for eternal damnation of your soul? You're too nice of a guy for me to want to do that to you, Mr. Marino.
Such a sweet boy. But after much thought and careful consideration, I've decided that the ruler for the next ten thousand years is going to have to be... me.
Metallica, Dad. Come on.
How bad?
Well, I guess I'm going to have to take a mulligan on this one.
What are you gonna do? Look at me, Nicky! I got no legs, I got no hips, I got one ear...
Coulda been much worse.
We gotta get this bad boy burning again. Ideas?
You followed him?
Really?
It's not that cold. Here, let me wrap it.
School?
Parsons School of Design. I knew growing up I wasn't much to look at, so I put my energy into making things that are pretty.
Sometimes, sure.
What?
"Mister Crowley, what's inside of your head..."
I have to, Valerie.
I love you.
Eight-hundred, split down the middle. Tuesdays and Thursdays I rehearse with my scene partner so the living room will be off limits.
I don't know.
If it's Cassius, yes.
Nothing will happen! I make the rules as I go!! Cubs do what I say! Always have! Always will! I got Cathedral and I'll never let go!
Never a pair. I have never had a pair.
Let me sculpt you and I will show you where the others have gone.
Even the alarm didn't wake him.
Of course not! I'm curious, not sick. 
Did you ever see anybody renew?
I think you've been skulling out too much. First Nursery and now stupid questions.
Look... why don't you get into the water... you need it... more than I do.
What are you talking about?! I saw you let a Runner go?  I saw you, Logan?? Tell me!!
Holly. Holly! Please... The other Sandman. Remember the one who came after --
Killed? Why do you use that word?
I thought I had to do something.
But I wasn't sure you'd come.
Thanks... but I have the choice.
I know what everyone knows. Try like hell for Renewal. You have the same chance everyone else has.
I let him go... believe me.
That's nice.
Where? Sanctuary? Can you take me there?
Logan, I don't know where Sanctuary is. But if I take you to them, they'll kill you.
Will he find us and kill us? Yes... or one of the others.  You know there's only one place to go now...
You think Sandmen will?  There's no other way for me,
Why, Jessica? You're still a green.
Because you felt like a Runner, didn't you.
And yours.
Sooner or later, we'll have to try something.
Why don't we rest here? We know we can eat these.
Are you sure?
I don't know... but it does.
Where are you going?
I like your face. Would you mind if Doc took a picture? I'd like him to give your face to somebody else.
My name's Holly... Holly 13. In ancient times they said my number was unlucky. Do you believe in luck?
I promise. We'll go on as soon as it's light.
Thank you.  Tell me -- what do those words mean? "Beloved husband"... "Beloved son"... "Beloved wife"...
My father was the husband and my mother was the wife. "Beloved" is a word they used -- to stay together.
Oh, yes... I think...
It kept going off for some reason. False alarms.
I don't know if I want to stay here. I don't feel safe.
Yeah, I remember.
How would you like to take me to dinner?
Hi.
Okay.
How'd it happen, Alice?
Okay.
What if Andy tips off Mr. Eddy?
I don't know his name. He's a friend of Dick Laurent's, I think.
Out in back.
Who is it?
Captain... this is some spooky shit we got here.
He's just been fingerprinted, and I'll run these blood tests right away. We'll find out soon enough.
My... My head.
No, no. I want to go in.
I thought I'd stay home and read.
No, nothing.
What night?
From the club. You didn't answer.
Yeah?
That dog woke me. I lay there for a while, then decided to get up.
Yes, I just found it on the step.
All right.
What?
But...
Which would you choose?
I'm sure you noticed that girl that was with me the other day... Good lookin' blonde? She stayed in the car?...
What?
Hey, Pete... How ya doin'?
We just killed a couple of people...
I don't know.
Come on... get in.
You've been fucking somebody else haven't you?
Thank you.
Yes. Those are our own people. They never venture beyond the point where you were met this morning. It is much too hazardous.
Okay, brother.
I say, good morning, Lovey.
Look at me. Look at what they gave me to wear.
Thinking? What about some double solitaire?
Yes.
Then I'm your man.  Come on, Toots.
You are a thief, sir, and a swindler, and I, for one, will be only too glad to turn you over to the police when we get back.
Horns?
And be poisoned out here in the open?
In a quandary.
Please! Please! Do not wait for me! I eat so very little.
Oh - that! That can wait. Nobody's going to run off with it.  Say, I've got to get busy. I want to show this whole layout to Chang.  So long. Don't you take any wooden nickels.
Oh, that's a cinch. I'll show them how to cast pipes out of clay.
Yes. I've just been talking with the porters. They're going to take us. We've got clothing, food, everything. Come on!
You mean you don't want to go?
Well, no. You see, I got this plumbing business—
You've no idea, sir, how unexpected and very welcome you are. My friends and I - and the lady in the plane - left Baskul night before last for Shanghai, but we suddenly found ourselves traveling in the opposite direction—
Thank you.
Oh, yes.
Very often.
Why not? She's an attractive young woman.
No, I mean about her appearance. If she should leave the valley - what would happen?
Please let me help you.
You've very kind Mr. Lovett.
Why, no.
Father Perrault is dead.
Are you the High Lama?
Of course I have suspected that our being here is no accident. Furthermore, I have a feeling that we're never supposed to leave. But that, for the moment, doesn't concern me greatly. I'll meet that when it comes. What particularly interests me at present is, why was I brought here? What possible use can I be to an already thriving community?
You?
It's far from over, from what I can see. This place gives me the creeps, hidden away like this - no contact with civilization. Bob, you don't seem concerned at all.
Something happened to me, when we arrived here, George, that - well - did you ever go to a totally strange place, and feel certain that you've been there before?
Did I say "if"?
Let me go, Bob!
All right. Sorry, George.
I don't know what you're talking about. You're carrying around a secret that seems to be eating you up. If you'll only tell me about it.
I'm tired of owing you things. You're free to go. Go ahead.
Besides, I - I don't feel like making that trip alone, Bob.
George, you couldn't possibly stay here, could you?
I'd go mad!
I don't believe it! I can't believe it. She's lying.  You're lying. You're lying! Every word you've been saying is a lie! Come on, say it!
I'm Alexander P. Lovett, sir.
I know - and a war broke out right over your head.
Brilliant!  Can anyone here fly a plane?
I don't know. He must have had some purpose in taking the plane away from Fenner.  When he lands, we'll find out.
Why, you - you— Look here - he may dash us to pieces!
You suggested my being brought here, didn't you? What gave you the idea I'd fit in?
A man whose life was empty!
Oh, I know. It was full of this and full of that. But you were accomplishing nothing. You were going nowhere, and you knew it.
I'm sorry. I thought I was to be the light. But why do I confuse you? Am I so strange?
I can't quite explain it, but everything is somehow familiar. The very air that I breathe. The Lamasery, with its feet rooted in the good earth of this fertile valley, while its head explores the eternal. All the beautiful things I see, these cherry blossoms, you - all somehow familiar.  I've been kidnapped and brought here against my will. A crime, a great crime, yet I accept it amiably, with the same warm amiability one tolerates only from a very dear and close friend. Why? Can you tell me why?
I wonder.
Well, everybody naturally wants to make a place for himself, accumulate a nest egg, and so on.
Why, mother?
Forgiven.  You know, when we were on that plane, I was fascinated by the way its shadow followed it. That silly shadow racing along over mountains and valleys, covering ten times the distance of the plane. It was always there to greet us with outstretched arms when we landed. And I've been thinking that somehow you're that plane, and I'm that silly shadow. That all my life I've been rushing up and down hills, leaping rivers, crashing over obstacles, never dreaming that one day that beautiful thing in flight would land on this earth and into my arms.
I'll make some for you!  You will come today?
Cowan--
Yes, air? -- OOOMPH.
It'll make sense later?
All the time, sir.
Kay...
Why?  What are you gonna do?
You heard me.  You two, especially.
But not a BUG bug-- it's an insect.
Well, first of all... I gotta think we could still blend in pretty nice in a Ferrari Testerrosa.  I mean, there is a lot of `em on the street these days, and... uh...
It's the way we do it.  The way we've always done it.
Why?  Well, it wouldn't hurt you to have a little more fun.  I know I don't know you all that well, but--
Uh... you mean... a family of sixeyed, red-faced space creatures travelling to New Mexico to have dinner with their cousins, the invertebrates?  Seemed pretty god damned ordinary to me.
I dunno.  Maybe it was baby supplies, Kay starts the car, starts to pull a U-turn.
Let's check am out.
Gee.  You really think?
What?
Get back in the car!
We're rising.
And I almost got digested. It goes with the job.
Oh no, I can't do this job by myself.
I guess you could say we're entopologists of a sort.
What is it?
It's the most amazing insect nest I've ever seen.  And I'll tell you one thing, it sure as hell ain't the Andean Mollatoosa.
They respond to fear, right?
No.
Yes.  Yes, that's eminently fair of you.
Nowhere, huh? odd you'd get all dressed up like that just to be going nowhere.
Wouldn't happen to be the Lincoln Memorial, would it?
What if I don't?
In about 10 seconds they're gonna start losing brain cells at the rate of about a million a minute.
Scientific American?  Really?
Well, uh... so we can got into things, I guess.
They're inside.
He won't.
Please --
Agatha, you're never going back there.
Oh, Jesus...
Yeah --
Tell you what, since you and I go way back, I'll give you my Old Pal discount.  How's that sound?
Oh, yes.
Yes, you did.
You made those tapes...
I can't even stand up --
I know you're in a hurry, so I juiced up the nano-reconstruction around your new eyes.
Organic microbots that reconstruct the nerves and blood vessels. It'll feel like fleas chewing on your eyeballs.  But whatever you do, don't scratch.
This about the Justice Department?  They laid on a tour for tomorrow a.m.  Told me to wear a tie.  You like this one?
I'm saying the third prevision wasn't there.  And that's not all. I spent a few hours down there and it turns out there's a dozen more cases with missing previsions.
I hear you've been spending a lot of time in the sprawl.
This is all Witwer.  He's setting me up.
Somebody named Leo Crow.
Everybody runs.
Armor up -- sick-sticks and concussion guns -- this is gonna be close.
I wrote it down in your calendar, then left a message at your house --
Case #1108, previsualized by the Precogs and recorded on holoshpere by Precrime's q-stacks.  My fellow witnesses for case #1108 are Dr. Katherine James and Chief Justice Frank Pollard.
Georgetown.
Sir?
Amazing there's someone within two hundred miles actually dumb enough to still do that.
Start a location run and a contact search for future victim Leo Crow.  And, Jad, I'll need a Last Known Sheet when you get it.
Check NCIC, maybe he's got a record.  Then send a protection team as soon as we lock the location.
Any ID on the shooter yet?
Your secretaries were all kind enough to give me a look around the office...
They did.  Make yourself comfortable.  We'll be back in an hour.
Speaking of interfacing, I'd love to say hello.
Really?  You've never been inside?
Maybe you didn't hear me.
The oracle isn't where the power is anyway.  The power's always been with the priests.  Even if they had to invent the oracle.
Oh... Hi, John.
Well, hey, you didn't have to come all the way down here.  For you, Chief, I make housecalls...
Rufus.  She's a precog.
What a big boy.  How old are you?
Are you kidding?  There's absolutely positively no way, on my best day, I could ever beat twelve seconds!
Sean, wait...
I put him in a barrel and sunk him in the bay.
So you won't help me?
I believe in that system...
Hold that thought.
If... you have one.
Which one is that?
No, it isn't, Lamar.  There was nothing anyone could do.
I thought you were retiring?
Lamar --
He's my subordinate!
This murder is happening at two different times.
Get the hell outta here.  You sick bastard.
That's the Red Ball Alarm.
We can stop him.
I was a Treasury Agent for eight years.  Why?
I think you're swell company, Knott.
Knott!
It was nobody's fault.
But I've seen the three hundred hours of your image he's got stored away.
What are you talking about?
Hey. I don't know, I don't want to know. Far as I'm concerned, you're a good kid. I got news, though, without you here I can't keep on your friend. I got enough people pretending to sweep.
Good luck.
Yeah.
Just tell me. Wait, here... Do you have change of a hundred?
Here. Take it. Bring me back eighty.
Where's the place to go tonight?
You girls aren't from Brooklyn or anything?
He's great, right. Is he great?
I don't like you working with Wendy. Why are you working with Wendy?
Some favor. I hope they know you're not like Wendy.
Who's watching the baby?
She's downstairs with Ruth. Get ready.
I'm not gonna mention Ricky to him.
Fine. You want to help Ricky, talk to Maxie yourself.
I just wish he never brought it up. Ricky won't shut up about it.
No coke tonight.  Right?
She'll be out in a minute.
He was uptown when I paged him. I gave him the address. He's meeting us there.
Smart. Hard as hell to handicap. You know what I like? Hai Alai. Fast game. You know why I like it?
This one?
A million. Easy.
Then what are you saying?
You told him you liked him.
Yeah.
You want --
You want us to be wherever you want us to be, ASAP, no questions asked.
We get it. We're sorry.
Harlem? What is it, a restaurant?
Yeah.
Ruiz is always on the list. He just ain't here, though.
Thanks a lot. Don't worry about it.
Any time, bro.
What about boxing?
That's not what you said. You said if you didn't have a winning record --
Yeah. Page me. You know the number?
I will.
I'll page you with the number.
I do. It's a fuckin Persian Palace.
Then why do you try to get in?
What happened to boxing? I thought we made a vow.
Your first start at DB, it's against Fairfax, and you miss the fucking bus.
Why do you always get stuck taking care of the kid.
I like it.
Seat belt.
C'mon, man, not in front of the baby. Put on your seat belt before I get another ticket.
What are you doing?
They said a hundred thirty-fifth and Twelfth.
Look, man, I never met Ruiz, okay? I don't know what the fuck I'm picking up, what the fuck I'm dropping off, who the fuck I'm meeting. All I know is Maxie's still pissed at me cause I sold his fucking van.
Sold it, stole it, whatever...
Oh, give me a break. Don't tell me you feel bad for the guy.
I mean, that's what I heard --
I don't know.
Yo, fuck him, man. Calling us guineas...
Like I said, I don't know.
You too?
Back in.
Fine.
Damn right. Bring us two bottles of Dom Champs and here, take fifty in case I call you bitch later when I'm drunk.  Siddown, motherfucker.  'Sex and paychecks.'
I swear to God, I'll fucking puke.
Yeah. Where they gonna whack us?
I'm your soldier.
I'm pretty sure we do.
You're out of money?
Eighty bucks?!?
This shit's peanuts compared to what we're gonna make with Maxie.
I'm sorry...
Think about it: You knocked out that Jewish kid's tooth, cost him eight grand, maybe more. Maybe lost his whole line of clientele? He knows you're fucking up Jess' dancing, and I got a feeling he knows I stole his carpet cleaning van by the way he looks at me. He can't kill us in LA cause that leads to too many questions. So he flies us out here first class for a 'drop' that's turned into whatever? He can make us disappear out here real nice...
Easy...
Take us right to Kennedy. Now.
Kinda. Yeah.
Show me. Show me where it says Screech on the fucking list.
S'up.
Where do you live?
I operate out of the Chicago O'Hare hub. Can I help you with anything else?
Maxie knows I don't go near drugs. I did a minute in Quentin for possession with intent. And it ain't now cause he woulda told me.
It means you got a gun?
He spoke to me. You want me to dis him?
What the fuck, 'Red Dragon?'
You really in trouble?
Pity. What's say we have a drink?
A little Charlie, perhaps.
Coke?
I've heard you've got the best coke in the States. The shit back home is pants.
Here...
That's alright, man. It's a little early for me to drink.
Yeah.
So you're our own private guy?
You rode?
Far as she knows you're John Gotti. Now put the shit down and act like you got some ass.
Mmmm-hmm. Where's the, uh, 'Dragon's lair?' Where do you live?
When?
Can you use a few bucks? I ain't got much, but --
Don't push it. You way ahead. You back on top. That boy loves you, man.
Put it in a cup of water. It's nutmeg.
Elijah who?
You the only cat don't come on with that "Whatcha know, daddy" jive; and you don't cuss none.
They sure ain't no black man's books in here.
Where am I gonna start?
I told you to go behind the words and dig out the truth. They let us sing and dance and smile -- and now they let one black man in the majors. That don't cancel out the greatest crime in history. When that blue- eyed devil locked us in chains -- 100,000,000 of us -- broke up our families, tortured us, cut us off from our language, our religion, our history.
Then the devil is white.
I can't.
I want to, Bembry, but I can't.
-- the hardest and the greatest.
You want a new car? You want a new house? Is that it? It's the money, right?
There's nothing to talk about.
And dogged when I set my mind to something.
Just hold me.
"Both women, in their 20's, charged they had had intimacies with Elijah Muhammad since 1957..."
Woman, have you lost your mind? What's the matter with you?
Bembry saved my Life. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad saved my life.
Open your eyes, you can face death 24 hours a day; but the possibility of betrayal never enters your mind. If you won't do that for yourself do it for us.
Families shouldn't be separated. I'll never make another long trip without you and the kids. We'll all be together.
I called Sister Betty, she didn't tell you?
What did I tell you about assuming?
Down front as always.
As Jesus was. Jesus was also a Hebrew.
Then we don't know that God was white.
That was a very bad statement. The country loved this man, and you have made it hard in general for Muslims.
And like a fool I believe it.
With him?
Not yet. But the way things going, that boy gonna turn her out any day.
Now you come back.
Well, all reet, then.
It isn't a hype, Shorty. And I meant what I said: join us.
That's right.
Head nigger in charge?
Brothers of Brother Johnson.
He told you that?
Yes, I am, Brother Minister. All I want is support for my children. He should provide for his children. That's all I want.
Believe it or not, you're safe here. The Judicial police will kill you. If they can.  This page?
Are you going to arrest me or talk me to death?
So you are going to talk me to death.
[Where are you staying in Mexico?]
[Why?]
We're interested in the same thing. I'm writing a story.
So where do we begin?
I have connections.
How do I contact you? We still don't have the ATM info.
[We have an ATM bank card. We draw out 300 dollars every two weeks.]
[Head of the anti-kidnapping division.]
[Yeah, I've got to get used to the routes. I -- It won't happen again.]
[Do you know who I am?]
[Who are you?]
[I don't know. We were just given instructions to take her.]
[How do I recognize him.]
[In the next hour, where do I find your partner?]
[It's all up to you, commandante. Tell me about you and 'The Dreamer'.]
[Lucky how?]
Don't give me that bullshit.
And a level five shithole is better than a level six. Your logic's inescapable.
How long you staying, Crease?
Got no plans, Rayburn, Nothing on. Just wanted to see you, how you were. Came by on impulse.
You do your best. They won't be paying you enough to perform miracles.
Maybe...
Frank only responds to commands in German. He was trained in Frankfurt. My Dad loves the idea of having a dog around, but hates the fact he lives inside.
Creasy. Just call me Creasy.
Time will tell.
Not at all?
No.
It wasn't a school like yours and there was no Sister Anna.
I'm not crying.
Once I get in the water but not starting off. By the time I catch up, it's too late.
Maybe. Did you hear him?
But the Emperor of China had 1000 of them! How can that be?
I don't understand.
Did you used to?
It's no wonder you're late. Why didn't she just come with you?
Your father has business.
Yeah. Because at one time, I didn't think enough.
Frank. Frankie.
There's no such thing as tough, Creasy. Just trained and untrained.
Yes, she told me. Do you have children, Mr. Creasy?
You should know they're tenacious when they want something. And Pinta wants to be friends.
Because...  I was already dead.
Los Arcos. Was a little girl kidnapped recently? About twelve maybe?
Camila. Camila Valencias.
Do you know what she told me last night?
[The car will not be powerful and have no trunk.]
Samuel is going to hire a new bodyguard. It may take a few days, but you're going back.
Our daughter.
These people are professionals. They don't waste their time taking children whose fathers are virtually bankrupt.
Why? You were so pleased with him.
It's not.
[That's good. Really good. He shot and killed two judicial cops and a kidnapper died in the attack. They're saying he's responsible.]
[It's a moral issue. On one hand you're cleaning up the bad guys, but in another way we are feeding the problem that produces bad guys.]
So am I.
I can take care of myself.
All right, I'm having a fair time. It's just that I get one Saturday night off in three weeks, and I wanted to wind up with something tonight.
What?
Yeah, sure.
Where?
Down there. That little one there.
Well, waddaya say, you wanna ask them? I'll take the one inna green dress.
Are you kidding?
Listen, Angie, I wanna tell you, you were very impolite last night. I introduced you to the girl, you just turned and walked off. Now, why did you do that?
I don't feel like going, Angie. I thought I'd take this girl to a movie.
She musta kept you inna shadows all night.
Brush her. Listen, you wanna come with me tonight, or you wanna go with this dog?
Angie. He says she was a real scrawny- looking thing.
Who?
You told me.
You son Thomas and Virginia, they come to my house this afternoon...
These are the worst years. I tell you. It's gonna happen to you. I'm afraida look inna mirror. I'm afraid I'm gonna see an old lady with white hair, like the old ladies inna park, little bundles inna black shawl, waiting for the coffin. I'm fifty- six years old. What am I to do with myself? I have strength in my hands. I wanna cook. I wanna clean. I wanna make dinner for my children. Am I an old dog to lie in fronta the fire til my eyes close? These are the terrible years, Theresa! Terrible years!
Who?
Were the lights on?
I'm a Catholic, you know, and even to think about suicide is a terrible sin.
Oh, you won't be so lonely. You'll make friends right away.
What're you talking about? You're a real likeable person. You'll make friends out there in Portchester one, two, three. You'll have people visiting you alla time. I'll come visit you. I'll borrow my brother Freddie's car, or you can call me up when you feel blue, or I'll call you up. And it's gonna be nice. Don't be so afraid.
We just live one flight up.
No, Mrs. Pilletti. We were just going home. Thank you very much anyway.
It's a very sad business, I tell you. A woman, fifty-six years old, all her life, she had her own home. Now she's just an old lady, sleeping on her daughter-in-law's couch. It's a curse to be a mother, I tell you. Your children grow up and then what is left for you to do? What is a mother's life but her children? It is a very cruel thing when your son has no place for you in his home.
Well, I'll tell you. I got stuck on a blind date with a dog, and I just met an old girl I used to know, and I was wondering how I'm gonna get rid of the girl I'm with. Somebody to take her home, you know what I mean? I'd be glad to pay you five bucks if you take her home for me.
Are you kidding?
Where you going now?
I never thoughta that.
Ma, when are you gonna give up? You gotta bachelor on your hands. I ain't never gonna get married.
Sure.
I heard you, Ma.
She looks a little old for you. About thirty-five, forty years old?
...and they sit down right next to me...
What nurses?
I just this minute got the baby to sleep.
She was here, you know, Wednesday, and I said, "Catherine, my sister..."
No, Virginia, I know how you feel.
I believe it takes both. I'd have to look it up.
Just use common sense. Your job is preventing sin, and the way to do that is give him your best Cross Action.
I don't know what else. You've been that route a little, haven't you?
Not enough to be a pro.
Or her figger.
I done my shopping in Seoul last night.
The spot we picked to spend the winter. Maybe we ought to look a little harder.
Finest kind. We'll sit where we can get the best view.
Sixteen times.
Way we hear it, the Pride is supposed to have run up the highest lifetime batting average ever recorded in Wayne County.
I worked with Spearchucker my first month over here, at the 72nd Evac in Taegu. Most of the colored guys know who he is but they're not talking because he asked them not to.
...trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against...
...And for our Supreme Commander over here and our Commander-in-Chief in Washington.
Right.
C-A-M-E-M...?
The Painless Pole plans to cross the Great Divide tonight and we need your help to straighten him out.
An eternal damnation.
'Course it isn't, but how many chances do we get to go to Japan? With our golf clubs.
But weren't you supposed to meet the surgeons who are going to slice up the Congressman's son?
If we don't get that pint, he's in trouble.
Oh, Jesus.
We'll have to close this hole and make one on the other side.
Honey, nobody as pretty as you could ever impose... please sit down. Coffee?
Oh, no. We have dull stretches every week or so, thank God, when there's nothing to do after midnight.
I don't make the distinction. But the sex urge is a powerful force. In women just as much as men.
Of course not.
I didn't mean with me.
It's your decision, Maria. I don't want to high-pressure you.
Who is knowing? But the drug I have find in his urine is solving all mysteries. By tomorrow will be gone his fast heart and high blood pressure. So I think maybe you will like to tell him goodbye. Okay?
Don Juanism is just a cover... I've been reading up on it.  I'm a fake, I'm a fraud, I've been living a lie!
But it's all over now, and I can't face it. Imagine if you found out you were one, you wouldn't like breaking the news to your wife. Well, I got the same problem multiplied.
There's no reason good enough for one medical officer to strike another.
It's the only way we can make enough to put Ho-Jon through Androscoggin.
Dammit, Radar, wait till I call you! Tell Major Burns...
What's that, Henry?
Mine's already been struck, and it doesn't have to be very fancy.
A big, rich slob like D. B. Norton buys a paper—and forty heads are chopped off!
Yeah, I'm all right.
Um-hum.
Well, all those guys in the bleachers think—
Oh, look. I'm the umpire, and you just cut the heart of the plate with your fast one and I call it a ball. What would you do?
Of course not. He wouldn't be.
Who?
Oh, but you don't know how big this thing is. You should see the thousands of telegrams we've received and what they're saying about you.
I don't know. About three hundred thousand.
How much money do you get?
Yes, sir.
Here. Wait a minute. Let me comb your hair. Sit down. There. That's better.
Huh?
There is no letter.
Uh-huh. You said you wanted fireworks.
A deal?
Who, for instance?
No, no, no. Now that's too much!
Thank you.
Well, nobody asked yuh.
Oh. Gee, you're swell! Oh.
. . . Tubby?
Yeh. Er, and my boss, Mr. Schwabacker made a job in his warehouse for old man Delaney—
Well, thank you for listening. Goodbye, Mr. Doe. You're a wonderful man and it strikes me you can be mighty useful walking around for a while.
Aw, Long John . . . I tell you—it's no good. You're gonna get used to a lotta stuff that's gonna wreck you. Why, that fifty bucks in your pocket's beginning to show up on you already. And don't pull that on me neither! 
What was I doin' up there makin' a speech, anyway? Me? Huh?  Gee, the more I think about it the more I could . . .
I think maybe you'd better. And Connell—I'd like to have the John Doe contract, all the receipts for the money we have advanced him and the letter Miss Mitchell wrote, for which I gave her a thousand dollars.
How?
Run a story. Say John Doe was in here, and is sorry he wrote the letter and—
Better get that story in, Hank, it's getting late.
No, no, no, the gal's right. We can't let the Chronicle get the laugh on us! We've got to produce a John Doe now.  Amateur journalism, huh!  I'll show those guys.
No, I didn't.
Let go of me!  This man had no intention of jumping off of the top of a building! He was paid to say so!  Do you deny that?
Yes! I was paid! But the—
No, I didn't write it, but—
Yeah. I, uh, well . . . No. It'll wait.  Say, he's a nice man, isn't he? Mr. Norton, I mean. He's, er, he's done an awful lot for the—
Yes, of course. I'll see that she gets the flowers.
Yeah, yeah, but look, Mrs. Mitchell, you know I love Ann and it's gonna be awfully hard for me to say it because, well, you know, she's so wonderful, and, well, the best I ever was was a bush-league pitcher.
How?
Well, when you get up on the radio, all you have to do is say the whole thing's a frame-up. Make you a hero sure as you're born!
Well, that's a cinch. I know somebody that'll give you five thousand dollars just to get up on the radio and tell the truth.
Yeah.
Oh, n-no, sir. The sea-gull is a lovely bird.
You worried about me, too? The chief's worried about me. Solis is worried about me. Maybe you guys should start some kind of organization.
It's not me. It's her. She's going out with this baseball player -- Greg Barnett.
Don't give up on her. You're getting to the age when you ought to be thinking about these things.
Come on. Just get in. We gotta go.
I got a couple thousand bucks. You could leave town.
Huh?
I'll tell him. Where does he live. We'll get him on the phone right now.
Am I gettin' the car?
That's right, and a plane waiting at the airport. If he doesn't...
Being faxed over now.
I want a car. Like a four wheel drive. I want it in perfect condition. I want a uniformed cop to drive it up right here. I want him to leave the engine running and walk to the end of the street. Then we'll come out. I don't want any remote control devices in it. I know all the tricks. If it's not in perfect condition, and I mean if its even low on wiper fluid, I'm going to kill somebody and we're gonna start again.
Is that all?
I'll worry about that. Let's get on with it.
I've rarely shot anyone.
Recruited you from where?
National Marksman Competition.
Not the ones I'm at.
She's back in Jersey... going to graduate school.
Oh, "city girl". Don't you ever long for companionship with her such a long way away in New Jersey?
Every couple of months, huh?
Fine.
That's okay. That's his style.
We won.
Damnit!
I don't know, but I've got to get on there.
I thought I could do it. I was so damn sure of myself. But I didn't know what to say. The words wouldn't come. My mouth turned to mush. You make it look so easy, Roper. But it is not. It's not easy.  It's a different job than looking through the rifle scope.
Husband came home. Found that guy and his wife "in flagrante". Now he's holding her at knife point.
Is the hostage injured?
Don't know. She keeps screaming to stay out. He keeps screaming to stay out. We decided to stay out.
Well, there's a good amount of agreement on that.
You heard.
Scott, You can't save everyone.
I've proved that, didn't I?
What do you want from me?
If you did, you never showed it.
You got a bet on the game tonight?
As a matter of fact, I do.
And it's hard to get.
And you think he'll...
Use your imagination.
Do it!
That's right. We've got to bare it all. Here and now. 'Cause I think I'm finally ready to go for it...
The car is part of the deal.
You know I can't assign you to this. You're much too close to it. You were much too close to Sam. The department will take care of it.
Who's running it?
We've only seen and talked to one suspect. He calls himself "Joe". There's two jewelers, two salespeople, the manager, a security guard, and an elderly woman. This particular store is where they do a lot of jewelry making and repair. They have anywhere from 8 to 10 million in raw stones on any given day, so they sure as shit didn't just wander in. They knew what they were coming for.
Just that I'd talk to my superiors.
True.
You're in there.  Everybody dies, you go with them --
-- Because there'll be no remorse. Not in my world.
I'm serious, how did you know my name?
Someone who believes in miracles.
The new world.
Only up there in the dream they called life.
-- He will.
At least a day.
I'm South Dakota.
Take care?  Where the hell are you going --
-- Yes.
He's not plugged-into the system. He's in the fucking system!
-- Christoph changed the maze.
That's right.
Good question.
Why would I do that?
To hide the evidence.
Cleaning up a mess.
Then how do you know about --
Of course you do.  And the only shot you've got of keeping your ass from sinking in a sea of shit is to tell me where you got this program.
Waiter, busboy, Maitre-De --
Uplink selected.
To assist you I have retro-fitted your helmets with new Opti-Scan devices.
Use extreme caution, Rangers. You are dealing with an evil here that is beyond ALL comprehension.
Be the swallow.  Be the swallow...
We could smell it's breath.
How about Major Moron?
Wait for me!
Quack like a'duck!
We couldn't have done it better ourselves.
I ain't no fuckin' kike!
The Bismark in Chicago. You familiar?
Ya still owe me fifty bucks for the train ticket.
Since Colosimo bit it, I gotta keep an eye out for his friends.
Charlie Luciano.
But not you.
Life knocked me back.
What's that divided four ways?
He was around...
Maranzano. Ta ice you.
Long as Charlie says.
Sure, Frankie. Fuck me. Fuck Meyer. Fuck Arnold Rothstein who's made us all rich. All so you can be an fuckin' honorary Sicilian!
Does Maranzano have to kiss you on the lips before you'll take his goddamn money?
For being a man.
It's a mask.
So you all make the same mistakes?
London?
I'm doin' business here!
But there's...
The minute we sell out to Maranzano, that bastard is gonna have you knocked off.
Married? To Anna?  You ain't got her in trouble?
I'll handle the Boss.
Might as well put the time to use.
They don't give a shit about us!
I got a place for you. In my family... or in the cemetery.
He's trying to make it.
So he can talk to all the families behind your back? Maybe have his own meet at 3:00 AM under the goddamn boardwalk? No. You're too smart for a sucker play.
MONEY DON'T MEAN SHIT!
Joe Profaci. Carlo Gambino. Vinnie Mangano. Joe Bananas. They all gotta die.
Not a lot ta know.
Don, I'd be honored.
Don, you talk about honor, but you mean vendetta. Killin' an' more killin' until nobody can remember how it all started.
I got partners.
And the Jews?
I found that out.
Coming with me will be a delicate matter. We will work it out. But Charlie...
The terms will be mine.
Thank you for keeping me informed.
Come on. Be polite.
Jesus.
What's it worth to ya, Boss?
Just wanted ta say hello.
Best we got.
This is nice. I mean it.
Oh, poor Buster. He hasn't been fed in a day and a half. Let me get some food...
Most we've ever used is half a CC.
I'm sick of martinis. I'm sick of the waiting, and the carnival rides, and watching people's <u>nightmares</u>. And of course, I need not <u>add</u> -
<i>De nada</i>. Now, come here...bend over...before I change my mind.
Thank me next time you see me.
Can you give me a realistic idea...of how long this is going to last?
Comas are unpredictable. He could wake up today, tomorrow, a month from now...
I think it's a pig hair. <i></i> How much is McDonald's offering?
Got the ring. Got the airline tickets. Soon as they break that piñata, we'll grab a cab - and it's off to the land of palm trees and coconuts.
Being rich is <u>not a trap</u>. That is a dirty lie perpetuated by rich people to keep the failures from killing them.
Y'see, Stu, as I understand it, you made this pact with your sister...no life support?
Oh, right. Cheating Death. There's <u>one thing</u> you might try. Only one guy in <u>history</u> ever pulled it off. Well, actually two. Actually, no, there was that other guy who...well, <u>very few people</u> have done it.
Baby? Why don't you just...rest on the sofa for a minute. I'll be right back.
<u>Well</u>, Miss Smarty, if I didn't go out, I wouldn't <u>need</u> any pants. Now would I?
The monkey!! He's everywhere! He'll take over both our lives if we let him.
Are you okay??
Is something wrong, Stu? You seem so tense.
Yeah. To see if he could expedite my case. But I wait, and I wait, and...I'm starting to think I'll never see her again.
You're the only true-hearted man I ever met. You find a way back to that girl of yours and make her happy.
I am not. And I don't gotta.
THAT DOES IT! BACK IN THE PACK!
Maybe he wanted to pick out his own casket?
You've been a hell of a figment, pal. I sure wish I could take you home with me.
Oh, let me get out of your way then.
Have a nice day.
No, I'm working too much, I don't have time.
You know ...  ... whoops!
Mother!
My daughter lives right across the street from the Satan's Disciples' clubhouse, and I was so worried about her ... so, I went over and introduced myself. And they were the nicest people.
No, I had a dream about daddy.  Do you think I'll ever meet anyone like him?
Oh, I hope so, dear.
I'd love to.
Poor man had to leave town.  And I hear that other women came forward.
Ohhh.  Do you know the East Village?
Not me, sonny. I'm just going to sit around and listen.  What's this?
Right up there over the Vice- President's chair--the four in the front row represent the four big news services. You've met the press bunch, haven't you?
I did not--
I'll brain that guy! Well--call Paine-- call Saunders--
That old standing offer from Diz Moore--Poet of Washington Correspondents.
You know--Mrs. Diz Moore.
Yeah. Should have seen me seven years ago--when I came to this town. *Now* what am I?--chambermaid to the Pied Piper of Jackson City; *Honorary* appointment! Scratch this thing an you'll find they wanted a dope here for two months.
Get my *whole* fall outfit--and quit this job in style!
He isn't going to hurt enough as it is. *She* has to twist a knife in him, too--the regal jackass! "I'll turn my glamour on him," she says--
I've wondered, Diz--maybe this Don Quixote's got the jump on all of us. I've wondered--maybe it's a curse to go through life wised up like you and me--
Shut up, Diz.
Like a mother sending her kid off to school for the first time--watchin' the little fella toddling off--in his best bib and tucker--and you sink in the middle--hoping he can stand up to the other kids--won't get his feeling hurt--and--if you could only spare him the knocks he's gotta take--  Say--who started this?
Diz--
How about getting married?
Tonight?
Tunnel?
Have *you*?
Yeah, I know. That's okay.
Come on--don't pull that. You know you'd give your right--. What are you staying away from him for?
All I know is--he said to me tonight-- "What does your wife think?" My wife. Thinks we're married--
Freedom of the press! Mr. James Taylor blindfolding a whole State--  Wait a minute! If that's how he wants to play *I'll* get through to that bunch--I'll get plenty of words into that, State--!  Come on, Diz, get that stuff you've written--let me have it--
That infernal phone!
What is it?
Of all the times! Of all the times! Two months to the end of his term-- and Foley has to go and die on us--
That settles it! I will not be attacked and belittled by my own children in my own home! My nerves are strained to the breaking point!
Washington! Always discussing the problems of Washington. Nobody ever thinks of the State--and my problems!  I *will* tell Jim Taylor. It's high *time* I told him a thing or two! 
Jim--if I fling a party man like Horace in the face of those angry committees--
You'll see those committees when we're finished!
We can't help *what* they were! Forget 'em!
Jim, that bunch is out for blood. If I throw Horace in their teeth now--
Joe--*you* know what I'm talking about. The perfect man. Never in politics in his life. Wouldn't find out what it's all about in two *years*, lets alone two months. But the important thing--and this was the genius of the stroke--*it means votes*!
Will you please tell me *exactly* what he's done?
Oh, now, I'm afraid that's been exaggerated some--
No. No. A signal service to the State. Yes, indeed. And not only that but-- uh--I've heard of your excellent work in leading and guiding our youth--
--And it is in my power to confer a very signal honor upon you. In my official capacity, therefore, I--
The--head?
What stuff?
Well, that ends that crisis. This way, Senator.
I addressed the Chair first, sir!
Even to the hat. Same old dreamer, too. One look at you and I can see him, back of his old roll top desk, hat and all, getting out his paper. Always kept his hat on his head so as to be ready to do battle. Clayton Smith, editor and publisher, and champion of lost causes.
Yes, Ma found him slumped over his desk that morning...
I know. I suppose, Mr. Paine, when a fellow bucks up against a big organization like that, one man by himself can't get very far, can he?
The *Bills*? Jeff--let me advise you-- as your father would--politics is a business--sometimes a cruel business. In your time here, you couldn't even start on those Bills. They're put together by legal minds--after a long study. Why, after twenty years, I can't understand half of them myself. No, really, Jeff--in your own interests--
Here--where are you running off to?
Good as new! It's quite all right--
Does my colleague's piece concern Section Forty of the bill--a dam on Willet Creek?
Every *aspect* of this matter--the gentleman's attack on that section-- everything--was dealt with in the committee hearing--
I will not yield, sir! This same man-- Mister Taylor--came here to offer me a place in this Senate for twenty years, if I would vote for a dam that he knew and *I* knew was a *fraud*! But if I opened my mouth against it, he promised to break me in two! And I stood here one day and tried--I *started* to open my mouth-- and it all came to pass. The long, powerful arm of Mister James Taylor reached right into this sacred chamber and took me by the scruff of the neck--
No, Jeff--please--!
I say it's *your* parade, sir! You've *got* to come!
Jefferson--
And Senator Paine too, Ma--we'd like to have him--
We'd better see.
Mine? Why--naturally--whatever benefits the state is mighty important to me--owning a lot of its industry-- newspapers and other odds and ends. And if I thought you had the welfare of the state at heart, like myself-- for instance, if you were to turn around and help a project like this along instead of standing in the way-- why, I'd say you were a man to watch. For a fellow your age, you'd be in a spot to make a great start in life. If you liked business--you could pick any job in the state and go right to the top. Or politics. If you like being a Senator. No reason why you couldn't come back to that Senate for the rest of your life.
No!
There *what* was?
You--uh--you better relax, Senator. You'll be plumb wore out.
I mean--gosh--I wouldn't be comfortable in a--I--I haven't got clothes and things like that--and--I couldn't keep pigeons *there*--No--I-- I just--just wouldn't be--
You get to your feet in the Senate and present it. Then you take the Bill and put it in a little box-- like a letter box--on the side of the rostrum. Just hold it between thumb and forefinger and drop it in. Clerks read it and refer it to the right committee--
That's how Congress--or any large body--is run. All work has to be done by committee.
*This* is.
Yes. Shall we start on it right now-- or order dinner first?
Pardon?
Yes, Senator--*twice*.
And something else, too, Miss Saunders-- the spirit of it--the idea--the--
He did?
I've been over every foot of it. You couldn't have any idea. You'd have to see for yourself--  --the prairies--the wind leaning on the tall grass--
City-dwellers never do that--for fear of what might drop *in* 'em.
I don't see where we are *with* it.
Well--nobody calls you anything but Saunders.
Lena.
Oh--*Saunders*!
*Who*! Miss--! Is that--? Why didn't you--? Holy smoke;  H-hello... Yes, Miss Paine... How-- how are you, Miss Paine...? What?... Escort *you* Gee--I mean--*sure*-- *yes*! I'd be--. Reception for a *princess*! Gosh!... Thanks, Miss Paine. Yes. I--I'll be there! Goodbye, Miss Paine.  Did you hear that?--Escort Susan Paine--reception for a princess! Imagine her calling me--asking *me*-- !
What you *have* to do is fight!
Not *me*! Joseph Paine is the man they ought to be listening to! Come on!
Wonderful!
Oh, the bill. Oh--splendid--I mean--  I--I just can't seem to talk in this suit.  I'll tell you a secret. It's brand new.
Well--I--
If the Senator permits this motion to recess he will not have the floor in the morning to babble or anything else, unless he is recognized first by the Chair.
Yeah? Well, when I get my hands on a red-headed doll with a southern lingo, I'll--
Why, he's a Senator, isn't he? I'm surprised at you, Mister McGann-- 
I've got 'im, Joe. Be right along.
That's dynamite, Joe!
I know that.
Saunders--it's meat and drink--lemme at 'im! Five minutes--! I'll make it right with you!
By the way, Mr. McGann just phoned-- in a high fever. Smith's gone again. Have you any idea where?
Look, Senator--I wasn't given a brain just to tell a Boy Ranger what time it is. What do you need me for? Get somebody else--get a registered nurse--
You deserve a lot better. And I'll tell you what we'll do. Stay and play nurse, as you say--and if certain things happen I'm taking everybody up with me, and you'll get one of the biggest jobs in Washington.
What do you mean?
Yes--
It's too late now--it's *impossible*!
Joe--what's the matter with you-- where you're concerned, I wouldn't take the slightest risk--'specially now after the great reputation you've made in the Senate. Why, look at this campaign I've started for you in all my papers. You're the logical man from the West on the National ticket--at the convention, anything can happen--
What do you think?
Jim, you can't come here and pull that steamroller stuff. Your methods won't do here. This boy is a Senator, however it happened, he's a Senator. This is Washington.
Jim, it's just that I like the kid-- I don't want to see you get too rough on him.
Anything *better* to offer?
Keep doing it! This is the whole works, Joe--we're out of business of bigger than we then we ever were. We can't miss a trick--we can't stop at *anything*--till this yokel's smashed up and buried so deep he'll never--!
I present the credentials of Honorable Jefferson Smith who has just been appointed Senator by the Governor of my state.
It was *I* who rose in this Chamber to accuse him. He is saying that I was carrying out criminal orders on falsified evidence--
Yes. Elsie Taggart was the midwife.
Oh yes, pixilated.
Sometimes he whistles.
And sings.
Yes, you own it.
Would you like to go for a walk?
Yes!
They're colored! Just to make him look silly!
Well, I'd like to - but I have a job to think of.
Do you always wear your hair like that?
That's what I like about you. You think about a man's feelings. I'd like to go down to that newspaper and punch the fellow in the nose that's writing that stuff—
To most people, it's an awful letdown.
Oh, that—
Nothing—
You have?
He did? I play the tuba—
The drums. He taught me to play some.
Yes. I can do "Swanee River." Would you like to hear me?
Yes, here we are again.  Good night.
Aw, cut it out, will you? You'll get me thinking about Charlie again.
Listen, Babe - get me some stuff on this guy, and you can have—
Yeah. Funny twist, isn't it?
You're crazy! You can't do that!
Aw, listen Babe, I can't let you quit now. You're not going through with this thing, are you?
Come on - let's go!
John—
Yes, I know. A week's gone by and we haven't got the Power of Attorney yet!
Yes, but you said—
They are? I forgot all about them.  What do you think they want?
Yes, sir.
Perfect! Perfect!
The smartest thing I ever did was to make that trip.
Nuisance value.  Maybe they have! Maybe they have! Maybe they have!  Mr. and Mrs. Semple, please. How do you do?
I'm not interested in the newspapers.
All set.
Okay.
Yes.
Not much. He's an uncle of mine, I think. I never saw him, but my mother's name was Semple, you know.
No, thank you.
Oh, I wasn't worried about that.
Oh, yes, there've been a lot of them around here already. Strangest kind of people. Salesmen - politicians - moochers - all want something. I haven't had a minute to myself. Haven't seen Grant's Tomb yet.
Well, you see, your uncle didn't bother with that sort of thing. He left everything to us. He traveled most of the time, and enjoyed himself. You should do the same thing, Mr. Deeds.
Oh - nothing. No extra charge.
A lawyer representing some woman with a claim against the estate.  Tell him to see me at my office.
Well, if he has a claim, we'd better see him.  Send him in.
No, I'm his housekeeper.
Why should you?
Some other time, Cobb. Some other time.
Are those stories true?
Okay, Santa Claus. 2000 lunches.
Why, the Chairman presides at the meetings.
Why not?
Oh. That.
One-third? That's about $7,000,000 isn't it?
Well, we didn't expect that much. I'm sure I can get her to settle quietly for one million.
Mr. Morrow, over there, for instance, just dashes them off.
Oh, yes. Yes. About my throwing those people out of my house. Mrs. Pomponi told the truth. I did throw them out because I didn't want the party in the first place. I didn't invite anybody. Mrs. Pomponi did all that. They just came to see what kind of a freak the "Cinderella Man" was. I don't know how people like that are supposed to act, Your Honor, but if that Pomponi woman is an example, I'll stick to simple folks. She just came in, talked my ear off, and took charge of everything. If I were a friend of hers, I'd have her examined.
Binge?
Where is your farm?
South Dakota - north?
Why, I'm assisting you, sir.
Tell me, Walter, are all those stories I hear about my uncle true?
You're Walter, aren't you?
As a matter of fact, you came home without any clothes. You were in your - uh - shorts. Yes, sir.
The ones who brought you home, sir. They said you and another gentleman kept walking up and down the streets, shouting: "Back to nature! Clothes are a blight on civilization! Back to nature!"
You kept searching me last night, sir. Going through my pockets. You said you were looking for a rhyme for Budington.
Yeah.
No!  What do you want!!
One hundred books?
He said he wasn't coming back. He said it wasn't working for him any more. That it hadn't "worked for him" for quite a while... You know what I regret the most? I'm sorry I let him make the kids take his name. He was an acquirer.  He liked to acquire things.
Of course... I've heard great things about you.
My approach?
What kind of doubts?
You came because it's taking over. You're in its grip.
-- and you told me that. Still, there's some kind of imagery that's haunting you and, I think, getting in your way --
My pleasure.
Nope.
Tastes good.
Yes.
I'm sorry you're frustrated.
Oh?
Upstairs, with Doc... Yeah, it's very nice... I heard your shower.
That's a lot of people all at once.
It's okay. They pre-order. There's a choice of three entrees.
Four months, two and a half weeks -- that's how long.  And you've already got more patients than those other two shrinks combined.
Lily, I don't think even you could know that --
Oh, so that's him? The Panda Man.
Where am I supposed to eat?
Clean up the mess. No matter what it takes.
Got to.
No... sort of. Man, she could be cool, but all she does is get wrecked and do all the guys. She's blowin' them in the parking lot.
I think you know what I mean.
Why don't you go to hell? It's all a bunch of nonsense and you know it.
-- the problem is you're a big fake. You haven't got a clue what's wrong with that girl.
Oh, lord. It's almost too exhausting to tell you...  ...about my exhaustion. I didn't really want to come. I'm not hopeful right now. But I couldn't take the look on my dad's face. He's a truly kind person, which is pretty extraordinary if you knew the story. He's the opposite of me, I guess -- all stamina and resolve.
About six months ago, I guess it is now. God, it seems like years. What a bore! I'm embarrassed by it. Before this happened -- when I'd hear people talk about this kind of thing -- I thought it was a bunch of bullshit.
You think that now! You think it's a bunch of hooey, don't you?
Hmm.
No one ever thought so. You must bring it out.
She's not in a bad mood. She's like that all the time.  It doesn't bother me anymore. It's my dad and my brother I worry about.
No.
Be specific.
So the headaches may not even be a part of this?
I don't know if I'm going to make it the whole way.
Oh... this makes me sound irrational, which is probably right, but there was something about him saying this -- it was maybe the millionth time he'd told me about some preference of his. Well, I was so... tired of it.  Seems like my whole life someone's been telling me... I'm just not getting it right. Can we rest for a second?
Oh, there's something wrong with you, all right. Especially after hearing that dream of yours, about the Roto-Rooter.
It's pretty obvious to a trained professional.
And this is legitimate therapy?
Yes! And my ex-husband -- he never accepted me for who I was, just like Mother. The things you've said have helped me understand what a dick he is.
How intuitive! That must take years of training right there. Maybe you can guess what has upset me.
I know a little about psychology. I took three different courses in college. It's true, none of them were above the two hundred level, but I took them... And there was one concept I remember very well.
But nothing... I'm mad as hell. This is a terrible thing you've done.
Will you think about it?
Anything... just ask.
Will you wait for me?
In maybe three or four issues.
Monthly! God, how shallow do you think Brad is? Why do I waste my time telling you this stuff?
It's my bit for the community.
Fuck the community.  There was this article my friends and I read. It was "25 Signs He's Great in Bed". It was very fascinating.
I want to have the session. I thought it would be cool if I could show you some of the things that interest me. But I guess you're not into it... which we already knew.
True. Should we stop them?
Lily and I talk a bit. You know Lily, runs the coffee shop?
She's probably ten years older than you.
Unbelievable...  ...And Lily named her dog after him? Far out.
Doc, I trust you! You've listened to me better than anybody... maybe ever.  And this secret I've got, I can't stand it anymore. I don't know if I'm some kind of --
It's true, believe me. So... do you know what I've been doing, all alone, in my workshop, for almost two years?... Mr. Find-the-Need-and-Fill- It. How I spend my every solitary hour?
Sounds like kind of a good idea.
What about everything? How did this happen?
But look at me now...
Wallace Franklin... from Greensburg.
'Cause I look good doin, it.
Yeah! Them.
When Ramesses destroyed Syria, it was an accident. You are a catastrophe! Why do I put up with you?
You will not believe it.
If we want to kill the creature, yes.
Yeah! It's supposed to be made outta pure gold!
Fifty percent.
Forty.
Every damn day.
-- I know what you mean. I was there, alright. Seti's place. The City Of The Dead.
I found sand. I saw death.
Yes, I'm hoping to find a certain artifact, a book, actually, my brother thinks there's treasure. What do you think is out there?
For entering the afterlife.
Egypt is in my blood. My father was a famous explorer, he loved Egypt so much that he married an Egyptian. My mother! Who was quite an adventurer herself
I'm staying.
Got what?
Yes, I know, and I'd like to keep them.
Yeah? Well,... I'm sure she's not a total loss.
Rat gizzards. They smell bad and taste worse, but that's the best the desert has to offer.
And now he's going to use it to bring his girlfriend back
What?
You have got to be joking?
Really?
So who killed him?
Do it, big boy!
I can't.
They'll think we're just a bunch of weirdoes.
It doesn't matter what we call ourselves. We know who we are.
It's me... Elizabeth.
Get on to yourself!
Ummm.
I got it.
Too bad. PLUG HIM!
They hurt... BUT THEY DON'T STOP ME!
Really?
Every night.
Nothing wrong with being a waitress.
I'm going inside.
Listen, Casanova may be a supervillain, but he's got a weakness, and I'm it. Maybe -- just maybe -- I can trick him into showing me the location of the whatchamathing.
It is not dead. It is hiding.
Blow it out your bean hole, Pancho!... And to hell with the rest of you!... Look at you. Bunch of rejects. I didn't need you before -- and I don't need you now!  The great ones RIDE ALONE!  Adios, muchachos! 
Okay, you win. I'm pissed off. I'm seriously peeved.
With what?
What a jerk -- and like nobody knows who he really is!
I lost another fork tonight. She's getting suspicious, I know it.
Because I can't! Okay? She wouldn't understand!
Well they've crawled back out.
Archenemies! Casanova isn't just a criminal -- he's a supervillain. Stopping him could be our ticket to fame, fortune -- and babes!
No one's sure that he actually exists, but they say he can be contacted by leaving a message on a crumpled up napkin at the Tacky Taco down by the bus station.
Come on.
Normal. What's normal? Does normal exist? And if it did, how would we know it?
Hey... he's gone.
Not yet.
We prefer to think of ourselves as unsung... I am the Blue Raja, Master of Silverware... 
Usually a superpower is a magical endowment or a great skill. In his case, it's entirely emotional.
What are you doing in the silver drawer?
We take the licks and he gets the chicks.
Or both.
The who?
Crime was rampant. It wasn't safe to stay in your home.
Great timing!
May the forks be with us!
Ah, yes -- proceed.
Ah -- you approve?
I think it's absolutely charming.
I know absolutely nothing of war -- and I am still totally dependent upon my generals.
What forces do you have at your disposal?
Are you proposing to transfer command to me?
Our lives, the revolution, my career?
Unhappily, it is true, sire.
But who made this treaty?
That is incredible.
I have never heard an unkind word about her spoken.
I suppose I might blame her for opening her house to the men most responsible to my downfall, but how can I?  She was on her own again, she had to look after her own affairs, and how can one blame her for having her head turned by the attention of Kings?
I have just had the most vivid... dream... about Josephine.
No, sire... I was asleep.
My God, what a fire!
It is the work of incendiaries.
I told Mortier that he would answer with his life for any looting.
Ah, good evening, my dear Duroc. I'm afraid I've been out hunting and I have had a rather bad fall.
What is that?
But this is not a matter which can be settled tonight, surely?
Does your mother know you have come?
No, sir.
Ah, well, that is the first rule of warfare.  You must wear long-sleeved and long-legged underwear.  You can never conjure up brilliancies with a cold bottom.
Then what brings you out on such a night?
Would you like to take me there, so that we can get warm, sir?
Uh-hh... yes, of course -- if you would like to go... there... but... I have very little money.
Only Lisette?
Junot?
Yes, of course, I would.  You know I am not one of your wife's greatest admirers, but I certainly know nothing about this.
You know I am only too happy to be of help to you, but surely this isn't the ideal moment to involve yourself in such matters.
Well, you shall see.
She will probably appear with a dozen excuses and you will forgive her anyway.
My dear Joseph, the only thing that is clear is that my wife is a slut -- and while a man may want a slut for his mistress, he does not want her for his wife.
No.
I cannot promise you that.
I will be there in five minutes.  Go back to your guests.
But you will not... be safe...
Not be safe?  What on earth are you talking about?
Well, he didn't give it to me, and when I ask you to do something for me, return the work to me, not to Berthier.
Certainly.
Well, maybe he's only looking out for your best interests.
I wrote it.
About Hippolyte Charles.
And was it so widely known that Joseph had reason for such concern?
No, Major, I merely wish to state that your vehicle appears to be somewhat slower and heavier than mine, and point out that, if you would be kind enough to pull over to one side of the road, I could pass you and be on my way.
Of course, my dear -- how cruel to have been separated from her.  And how strange it must be for you to be here, away from your family and everything you know.
Oh, my dearest child -- you must not worry about anything.  I will teach you everything that you must know.
Has Alexander agreed to this?
I very seriously doubt it.  I don't think there is any possibility of making peace with England so long as she sees herself safe from invasion. That is why we must increase the pressure on her economy.  With Russia in the Continental Blockade, England must collapse.  More than 40% of her trade is with the Continent and Russia.
What you are talking about is a gamble on moderation -- when I gamble, I prefer to gamble on force.
Duroc, I have a bill here for 600,000 francs from Tirot, for building the Imperial throne and six decorated arm-chairs.  The amount is absurd -- and, at least twice too much.
That's it?
Go, fo' I change my mind.
Naw, it ain't like that.
Thanks, Unc.
Don't need water.  We didn't have no pool in the projects...so none of us swim.
Passed out?  Can't hang, huh?  Boy, I knew you was a lightweight.  Passed out on one funky ass blunt.  They don't make 'em like they used to, baby.
Daddy, Uncle Elroy, I need your help.
Thank you.  I only got two bullets in the mothafucka, but it's better than nothing.
You.  Hi, Uncle Willie.
I know; this a long way from Watts.  But what I like about living out here is that you don't hear no helicopters, no sirens, no drive-by's, no nothing.  Just peace and quiet.  Listen.
They ever let you hit the switches on that Cadillac?
Damn, you got a stalker.
Sorry about today, man.
Day-Day, if you don't hop that fence I'mma throw you over.
I will.  When can I come visit?
I don't know.  Probably next Friday.
To the Cucamonga shopping center.
It's cool.  You ain't got to apologize for your brothers.  They're big boys.
Most of it.  I just hate to see you in this situation.
I'm sorry to hear that.
So what?  Let's make'em wait.
Yeah, I'm cool.  See you later.
I fell in some mud.  Now hurry up!
Smells like you didn't fall in no mud.
Come on.
Sir, the manager stepped out for a moment.  I'm currently running the store. Can I see the CD?
I don't have no damn cover.
Bullshit!  I'll go postal in this mothafucka!
What up, bro?
Yoooo, that's it.  You ain't as dumb as I think you are, Roach.
...and some rolling papers, that's it. We didn't mean to mess up y'all get together or nothing.  How y'all doing?
I know.  I'm sorry.
What?
Are you going to take me to see Mom?
Take your car.
Don't worry 'bout nothin', big bro.  He in the best fuckin' hands in Rancho Chocomunga, baby!  This my world, you just a nigga late paying rent.  Ain't that right, nephew?
I don't know, I didn't leave you no damn message!
I got my mase.
Okay.  Bye, Craig.
Come on, El, you're a trooper. I'll get you some Pepto, you'll make one of your patented tributes to the common person, then back to Sacramento. This is no time to lay down on the job. I don't care what the polls say, you can't afford to relax. Look what happened to Bush. Tell you what, if you want to blow off the Sacramento speech, fine. But do this one and we'll get out of the smog.
You sent my assistant on an errand.
Sorry.
Oh, yeah?
I...
Of course.  I wish everything were that easy.
I saw her die. She was shot. With this gun.
It's the last chance they have for me to kill you. Try to get out of it. They won't let you. They can't. Try to change the schedule and you'll know I'm right. What have you got to lose? It comes down to who you trust, them or me? Test them.
Yes, I'm listening.
Do you now, Mr. Watson?
I kill her - and you kill me.
Let me talk to her again.
You know what I'm gonna do.
No way.
Nods.
I promise.
Hey, a big tip doesn't give you the right to crap in my ear. You want change?  You got it, brother. What was that you gave me, a twenty?
Kill the Governor.
Thank you.
What are you going to do now?
I think this is worth a dollar.
It looks real. I don't know anything about guns.
My daddy is going to be a hero? Like Power Rangers?
Why?
I've got something for you.
What about them?
Come with me, honey.
Just put her on.
Tell you why I ask -- your step-pa being' a Preacher an' all...
How do you mean?
Walt!
A man of the Cloth?
Sure, but you was worried too, Mother; takin' off with never a word of goodbye. I even got to figurin' them gypsies busted in and done off with all three of 'em.
Twenty-five wives!
He's Satan hiding behind the Cross!
It's a shame!
It's for the pick-nick. And you won't get a smidgen of my fudge unless you stay for the pick-nick!
The devil wins sometimes!
There! What's so hard about that!
'Cause you're too little.
When Mr. Powell's our Daddy then I can tell him about --
John! Don't!
You promised Dad you wouldn't never tell!
Somewheres. I don't know yet.
Is that all?
You think you can make me tell! But I won't! I won't! I won't!
Are we keeping secrets from each other, little lad?
Naturally.
Can I have milk too?
Surely. I'd like to talk to you, my dear.
Will you buy me a choclit sody?
O' course.
It is my shame -- my crown of thorns. And I must wear it bravely.
A scrawl. On a piece of notepaper on the bureau.
Well, John, the night before your father died, he told me what he did with that money.
No, Harry! I thought --
Them kids is yours?
My flesh and blood!
The Drugstore?
Pearl and John.
R.E.M.'s. Rapid eye movements. The eyes follow the dream -- their movement picks up on this --
Oh -- jeez -- Glen! Rod's gone ape!
One two, Freddie's coming for you? No. Rod killed Tina. He's a fruitcake and you know it.
What happens if they don't do that?
Great.
Who?
You do?
My dream.
What?
She had a nightmare about somebody trying to kill her, last night. That's why we were there; she was afraid to sleep alone.
No, I know, thanks to your own testimony, that he was locked in a room with a girl who went in alive and came out in a rubber bag.
You know he's dead though, right?
Terrific. What the hell was she doing there?
Krueger?
It wasn't that serious...
Maybe you don't think murder's serious --
Get into bed.
I will.
To bed with you, c'mon.
No, Mother. Yes, Mother. No, Mother.
And no school tomorrow, either. You take a little vacation, relax and rest for a change.
Yes, Mother. G'night.
Dead and gone.
Go on...
I told you.  It was dark, but I'm sure there was someone else IN there, under the covers with her.
Forget it, the point is, everybody has nightmares once in a while. No biggy.
No more fights.
No, the opera starts an hour later tonight on account of the parade.
That's just it. It makes people feel queer. I dont' want you to get in any trouble.
Ninotchka, I wouldn't bring this up if we weren't such good friends.
...and little Lady Beatrice?
I should be a swallow! Right now I would be sitting in front of the Café de Paris picking up flakes of French pastry that would melt in my bill.
Leon, how would you like to have three lifelong friends?
That's right... and we might as well face it.
May I ask how much your rooms are?
You didn't get legal advice?
Do you spell Buljanoff with one or two f's?
You might get me an accurate map of Paris. I want to use my spare time to inspect the public utilities and make a study of all outstanding technical achievements in the city.
Yes, Comrade.
I think I need my glasses.
Friends... friends, Buljanoff, Iranoff...
Who gave you this idea? What is responsible for all this?
In any case, gentlemen, a charming, beautiful, exquisite woman. I warn you, if this case comes to trial it will be before a French court, and when the Duchess takes the stand...
That's all right.
Go to bed.
Emphatically not, sir. The prospect terrifies me. Now, don't misunderstand me, sir, I don't resent your not paying me for the past two months, but the thought that I should split my bank account with you... that you should take half of my life's savings... that is really too much for me.
They hope the settlement will bring you a fortune.
Soviet Russia will put all its might behind this case.
We avoided luxury and extravagance and today... well, if you were to offer us a glass of champagne, we wouldn't say no.
...it is in the air... it may come around the corner as you walk down the street....
But how will she look? The fashions this spring are very becoming to her. Gentlemen, the judge will be French, the jury will be French, everybody in that courtroom will be French. Have you ever seen a French court when a beautiful woman sits on the witness stand and lifts her skirt a little? You sit down and pull up your pants and where will it get you?
What did she say about me?
I think she covered you with the parasites.
Too bad we have to waste all that time.
I'm afraid we have no boxes of that size in our vault, but there is one suite with a private safe...
Why?... Why should you carry other people's bags?
No, thank you.
I hope so for your sake.  Let us examine the case. What does the lawyer say?
That kind of propaganda is bad anywhere, but inciting the attendants of a powder room to go on strike.... Well, if she succeeds the consequences will be disastrous.
What can I do about it?
Here's my passport.... Please give me a visa. I have to leave for Russia immediately.
Count Leon d'Algout... a count!... a nobleman!
I want to see a friend of mine... a very dear friend.... It's a personal matter which has nothing to do with politics or social philosophies.... It's a girl.
Yes. Could you give me some information?
Well -- until the policeman whistles again.
In other words you don't know.
I am interested only in the shortest distance between these two points. Must you flirt?
Suppress it.
I'll try.
Yes, very strange.
I see a house that looks like any other house. What's remarkable about it?
Yes.
The day will come when you will be free. Go to bed, little father. We want to be alone.
Is that customary?
You're the most improbable creature I've ever met in my life, Ninotchka, Ninotchka...
I'd love to.  Tsk, tsk, tsk.
Don't pity me. Pity the Polish lancer. After all, I'm alive.
I can't possibly think of a better reason.
Let's forget that we ever met.
As a representative of Moscow...
I don't like your following me.
But my dear child, I am most at home among working men. I hate the places where you circulate -- the Hotel Clarence... This is my natural element. After all, what are any of us? Workingmen! At least, those of us who are worth our salt. Hyah?
Must one always be after something?
Oh, Ninotchka, who wants to talk business. If you win the suit, fine. If we win the suit, better. You do me an injustice.  When we went to my apartment did I have the slightest idea that you had any connection with this deal?
Death! Death! Always so glum! What about life, Ninotchka! Do Russians never think of life? Of the moment in which we are living? The only moment we really have? Don't take it all so seriously, Ninotchka. Nothing is worth it. Please... relax... I beg you, Sergeant... smile!
What?
Probably not.
No.
Well, so far it isn't funny, but wait. He says to the waiter, "Waiter! Bring me a cup of coffee." So the waiter comes back five minutes later and says, "I'm sorry, sir, we have no coffee."...  Wait a minute... wait a minute... I'm all mixed up...  A man comes in a restaurant, he sits down, he calls the waiter and he says, "Waiter! Get me a cup of coffee without cream," and five minutes later the waiter comes back and says, "I'm sorry, sir, we have no cream, can it be a glass of milk!"
I don't think so.
Ninotchka, I love you.
Ninotchka, you're jealous.
You never finished the one about the two Scotchmen with the names.
Well, there were two Scotchmen. One was named McIntosh and one was named McGillicuddy. They met on the street.
You just made that trip from goats to grapes a little too fast.
What, darling?
No speech.
I love you, my little Leonitchka!
And we won't stretch up our arms...
Yes... a kiss... salute!
Much happier.
Radio! What is radio?
No, no music.
It wouldn't be fair to the man in the street.  There they are... they are terrible things, those jewels....
Please.
The one I got they wouldn't let me read.  It began, "Ninotchka, my darling," and ended, "Yours, Leon."
Well, when it is a choice between my personal interest and the good of my country, how can I waver? No one shall say Ninotchka was a bad Russian.
Good morning, Swana.
Your conversation has one marvelous advantage, Swana. However many questions you ask you never expect an answer.
What does he say?
Huh?
No.
Not in your condition.  Make it tepid, Gaston... tepid and tender. And lay out his gray suit.  Afterwards I'll drive you through the Bois. Slowly... in Waltz time.
You just told me you hadn't seen her.
You saw all that in one glimpse?
Darling, if we're going to get anywhere someone has to keep his eyes open! 
Now, darling, soak in your beautiful pine bath and let Gaston shave you.
Yes, Swana.
Yes, Swana.
Yes.
She's gone, Leon.
My dear, you don't know how impressive I could be. Did you ever see me in my regalia with my diadem and all my jewels?
In that case I can only say good-by.
Where are they?
Unfortunately.
No, I just wanted to be absolutely impartial. Both of us are faced with two rather uncomfortable years. We can condense these two years to two minutes if you want to accept my proposition. Ninotchka now realizes what she is after.
Good morning, Comrade Commissar. Here is my report on the materials available for trading in the next four months.
Yes, it does.
Well, Comrade, I am afraid you will have to turn over that work to someone else.
Raw carrots and beets.
Oh, madame! This is a restaurant, not a meadow.
That also is a question of food, madame. I'll bring you a nice little lunch à la Père Mathieu. 
They are here!... Your jewels!... Here in Paris!
Pay him.  Pay him what he wants.
Yes ... I got the money.
That's not the question, John.  The question is: Why is he paying?
Howard, you'll serve no more than two years, then he'll pardon you.
John, sooner or later -- sooner, I think -- you are going to learn the lesson that has been learned by everyone who has ever gotten close to Richard Nixon.  That he's the darkness reaching out for the darkness.  And eventually, it's either you or him. Look at the landscape of his life and you'll see a boneyard.
They went after Castro.  In some crazy way it got turned on Kennedy.  I don't think the "P" knows what happened, but he's afraid to find out.  It's got him shitting peach pits.
Well, sir ... it turns out -- one of the people implicated is still, you see, on our White House payroll.
And?
The hard-core four million "Nixon nuts" aren't gonna go for it ... They'll say I sold out to the Communists.
Mr. Hoover was a realist.
I don't have a pistol.
'Night, Al.
Sir, the deadline is today.
Three days before, on the June twentieth tape -- the one with the eighteen-minute gap --
Contributions!  It was a legal contribution.  Who the hell authorized this?  Colson?
But, sir, you're covered -- no one here gave orders to break into the damned Watergate.  We're clean.  It's only the Ellsberg thing, and if that comes out, it's "national security."
How about a COMINT classification?  We put it on the Huston plan.  Even the designation is classified.
It's got nothing to do with justice. It's national security.
Yeah, but Roselli wasn't just any gangster.  He was the gangster who set up Track 2 in Cuba.
Run 'em over.
It's the parents' fault really.
You're talking too much about black Africa, Henry.  It's killing us with the rednecks.
This could be it ... this could be it. Four long years ...
He'll be looking in his toilet bowl every time he pulls the chain.
I don't ... have them.  Mother ... I swear, I ... didn't smoke.
So am I.  Thy father will have to know of thy lying.
What'd you say?
And so shall I.  Arrange some coffee, would you General Cushman?
Then find something.  And I want these leaks stopped.  Jack fucking Anderson, the New York Times, the State Department -- I want to know who's talking to them.
Firing you, Mr. Helms, wouldn't do any good.  Of course you'll continue as DCI.  You're doing a magnificent job.
Yes.  And you will give General Cushman full access.
By offering Cuba to the Russians as a consolation prize?
Flowers are continual reminders of our mortality.  Do you appreciate flowers?
No.  They make me sick.  They smell like death ... I had two brothers die young.  But let me tell you, there are worse things than death.  There is such a thing as evil.
Actually, I've just had a bit of luck.
I know you've been very careful not to.  That's why I'm concerned.
It could be '60 all over again, Edgar. Bobby's got the magic, like a goddamn rock star.  They climb all over each other just to touch his clothes! He'll ride his brother's corpse right into the White House.
The old queen did it on purpose.
No one.  Your property.  It would prove your case.  Why do you think Kissinger's taping your calls?  For history.  His word against yours -- and right now he's got the records.
They're around.
Just don't tell him to do anything you don't really want him to do.
Personally I'd prefer a greyhound with a shot of speed.
Remember -- listen up!  Fire team discipline is there at all times. Keep your radios on at all times during the entire penetration.  Check yourselves.  Phony ID's, no wallets, no keys.  We rendezvous where?  The Watergate, Room 214.  When?  At zero three-hundred.
Well, uh, Trini and I have an early plane.  We were hoping to get back to New York in time for ...
We're gonna hit him so hard he looks like everything that's sick and evil about the Eastern Establishment.  You and your "plumbers" are gonna find dirt on this guy -- let's see him going to the bathroom in front of the American public!  And when we finish with him, they'll crucify him!
Finally someone who's noticed!  I'm a great admirer of yours, too, Mr. Nixon.  You are an unusual politician. We share a mutual idol -- "Six Crises" sounds like a page from Churchill.
This is a major coup, gentlemen -- our own State Department doesn't even know.  And if it leaks out of here tonight ...
Oh God, I'm going to throw up.
You have many friends ... and admirers ...
How a fat man gets so many girls.
Why?
Looks can be deceiving ...
Civil war is always the cruelest kind of war.
... but it's not, bottom-line, gonna change a goddamn thing, John.  The question is: How do we screw Ellsberg so bad it puts the fear of God into all leakers?
You know, this kinda thing, you gotta be brutal.  A leak happens, the whole damn place should be fired.  Really. You do it like the Germans in World War II.  If they went through these towns and a sniper hit one of them, they'd line the whole goddamned town up and say: "Until you talk you're all getting shot."  I really think that's what has to be done.  I don't think you can be Mr. Nice-guy anymore ...
You remember, John, in '48 -- no one believed Alger Hiss was a communist. Except me.  They loved Hiss just like they loved this Ellsberg character. East Coast, Ivy League.  He was their kind.  I was dirt to them.  Nothing.
Well, he seems to have bought Kissinger.
That'll be the day.
That was a long time ago.
... Any information you have, Edgar. The sonofabitch is not gonna steal from me again!  Can you back me up on this?  Can I count on your support?
Hello ...
And we got the "big mo"!  We're back!
Sir?
Of them.
No, sir ...
We don't have to put ourselves through this again, Dick.
What do you mean?  We worked for it. We earned it.  It's ours.
You're not a failure, Dick.
You're not going to blame this on Castro, are you?
My God -- divorce?  What about the girls?
No, I'm not!  I'm finished.
Because ... I have to relax.
Tomorrow.
You can't expect me to explain that to you.
What matters to me is whether you understand it.
They were for me.  They're mine.
Well enough.  You're looking "happy," Nelson.
Lost.
The "crises"?
You heard it?
But -- how'd you know it was mine?
I don't know. Nothin'. Wouldn't be no point to it.
Yes.
Not word one.
Would you tell me if you had?
Well, I don't know. He don't need any trouble from you.
These people will kill him, Carla Jean. They won't quit.
I wish I could say that was in his favor. But I have to say I don't think it is.
He can take all comers.
I'd say it is. Not a doubt in my mind.
Wasn't no bullet.
Well I don't either!
Okay.
That DEA agent called again. You don't want to talk to him?
When is the county gonna start payin' a rental on my horse.
Hyah!
That's very nice.
I always am.
I can't plan your day.
Well you got time for 'em now. Anything interesting?
What little I had is long gone and they's bill aplenty to pay yet. I buried my mother today. I ain't paid for that neither.
To your husband.
What? Quit hollerin'.
Goin' where?
Llewelyn --
Yes ma'am?
What should I do?
I need you to step out of the car, sir.
In the truck.  I'll get it.
I think that you do. Do you know where I'm going?
With what?
Yessir.
You live in that house behind the store?
Call it?
Yes you did. You been putting it up your whole life. You just didn't know it. You know what date is on this coin?
Everything.
Never mind.  I want a tent.
I want you to take me to another motel.
Goodbye, Mr. Wells.
Then you'll like me.
I don't think that's how I would describe him.
I know how he found me.
It's called a transponder.
I been immobile.
The heroin. You don't have it.
No I don't have it.
What outfit.
So she did witness it?
...you are so goddamn weird.  Oh, and by the way, get the hell outta here!
It wasn't a woman.
Yes it was. Betty saw the whole thing! Your killer's name is Chloe...
Seems she was pretty familiar with 'ol Del. On a regular basis, if you get my drift...
A woman can write a check.
'S just a theory... just 'cause I'm thinking it don't mean I like it.
I spoke to Betty Sizemore yesterday.  That's right. There's no doubt in my mind, folks... she's on the run. Whether or not she's mixed up in all this remains to be seen...
What about it?
Any idea where it is?
I'm not going out there! Let's wait for the real police...
I dunno. Job satisfaction, I guess...  How's things at the Tip Top?
This is Roy Ostrey, he's a reporter. And this is Sheriff Ballard. We all went to Fair Oaks High together...
I have no idea what he was mixed up in... it was always something.
Sure. You could probably have any thing you wanted... somebody as beautiful and stylish as yourself, and you don't even realize it.
Yes... Not the actor, though, the doctor. I think.
Dr. Ravell's the finest surgeon on the staff. You must know him. He's incredibly handsome, gentle, considerate. He's being sued for sexual assault right now, but --  It's not true. He was set up.
You sure? Maybe next week we could...
Are you and Larry happy?
Oh, I dunno... enough, I s'pose.
All you been through... I ever tell you what a good friend you are?
Sue Ann, I thought you of all people would back me up on this, you know what Del's like. How did he take my note?
Betty, honey, listen to me. A man came by from Mutual Life Insurance. He says you've got money comin' to you from Del's policy.  Del's life insurance policy -- Are you with me?
Right, Del. Del was one hot salesman. Of cars. He could talk anyone into anything.
He never told me anything about... that's unbelievable!
I know. Listen, we need to take a time out here. Can we talk seriously for a minute?
I know. It's up to us.
Well, I just feel that life'll be much sweeter for you now with me around. I promise...
Who put you up to this? Did my ex- wife ask you to...?
No, I... I'll leave. Forgive me if I caused you all any trouble... I just, I don't know how I...  ...I'm sorry.
George...
...it's too bad you're such an asshole. 'S the only thing that Del was ever right about.
Oh, you're there. You sound out of breath.
What's so special about it?
I told you. Sue Ann was gonna take me out tonight, but...
I took the blue Corsica, Del. Relax.
Just knock it off, 'kay? Anyhow, they're 97's, they're not even new.
Yeah, I guess there's nothing like watching those tenpins fall, huh, Del?
You're not on that soap opera thing again, are you? 'Cause you know what that is?
I'd slap his face.
Europe? The Europe?  This is my first time out of Kansas.
You take care of yourself then, Betty, and don't let anybody stop you...
I'm not. I just drove in from Kansas.
'David.' That's your guy. So, you staying with him?
The one you were telling me about?
Just look for the really crowded road and follow that.
Fuck the details, they're always to blame... Look, too many of these guys duck out on us, especially after they become doctors or lawyers. I see it at my company all day long! So I'm just gonna make sure you get your, you know, fairy tale ending or whatever...  One of us should.
What? Where was he?!
Umm...
But, you're in love with someone who doesn't exist. You come here, you meet this guy, who should laugh in your face, and instead you leave with him!  Betty, you are one-of-a-kind...
Well, what if this guy's just playing with you? What if he's lying about who he is?
Yes, I had a husband and he was killed two weeks ago in my kitchen. I was right there...
You know, it's interesting. The South lost the Civil War, but they still seem to get all the glory.
Even Robert E. Lee was a loser.
If we're for real?
Let's see... around here that would be Kiowa, Kickapoo or Osage, if I'm not mistaken.
Stupid is calling people in Kansas City who are affiliated with the rightful owners of the thing you stole, and trying to sell it to them. Right Wesley?
That was to get him to talk!  Get rid of that thing, will you?
I had to shoot him! It was the only decent thing to do.
What 'look'?
That one look you got! I thought you were done, so I took him out...
Why not, it'll confuse 'em... gotta do something, now that you fucked it up.
I can eat because I know we didn't kidnap that woman. I can eat because they aren't looking for us. And I can eat 'cause I'm fucking hungry...  ...relax. She's gonna end up on a milk carton and that's about it.
I'm sick of looking at her mother- fucking face.
Not so fast! Slower... 'blonde, thin', yes... Did they say she had style? A kind of grace or anything?
What difference does it make? She wasn't in Kansas City, or Houston, or Dallas. We went to every goddamn place Del mentioned and no Betty. So what the hell makes you think she's in Vegas? You think she's waiting for us with tassles on her titties? Vegas is too crass for Betty.
Maybe she had to use the bathroom. She pees, doesn't she?!...
'Cause I just don't buy it. Call it instinct. Call it 35 years of professional know-how...
Man, you have got to get some therapy.
You made your point...  I was wrong.
Aren't you a sweetheart... no, not quite. Anyway, she's been with us awhile.
You fucked it up. Who wouldn't freeze in those circumstances? And I don't care what her problems are. She wouldn't be the first one in that cast with problems. We have nothing to lose by making her an offer.
Ahh, Mercedes, I think. Black.
Because it ain't natural, young man.
Names, a phone number, something...  Listen, Ballard told me that the guy who brought the missing car down from Detroit was murdered, but do you see him doing anything about it? If Ballard wasn't such a stubborn ass, I wouldn't have to be breaking in here...
No, about... Are you talking about Duane Cooley?
Yeah. Why, you know him?
So how's it going with your new roomie? What's her name?
So tell her to settle for the old one in Orange County.
No. But I'm taping her show every day so she can watch it when she comes back.
Her show?
And thank you as well for that conversational hiatus; I generally refrain from speech while engaged in gustation. There are those who attempt both at the same time but I find it course and vulgar. Now where were we?
You mis'able little sneak thief...
That's right! We ain't really Negroes!
All except fer our a-cump-uh-nust!
Preacher said my sins are warshed away, including that Piggly Wiggly I knocked over in Yazoo!
Caintcha see it Everett! Them sigh- reens did this to Pete! They loved him up an' turned him into a horney- toad!
Not that I'm aware.
Oh my God!
Pappy gonna be sittin' there pants down and Stokes at the table soppin' up the gravy.
Well, it's a well-run campaign, midget'n broom'n whatnot.
Gonna paddle ah little bee-hind.
Well now, I don't believe assa property scription.
Well, I believe it's mawva kickin' sichation.
Wipin' little circles with his bread...
No one says no to Pappy O'Daniel.
Vernon T. Waldrip.
Hell, now's the time to buy it off him cheap.
You said it was in the rolltop desk!
Pete, it's a fool looks for logic in the chambers of the human heart. What the hell's that singing?
Isn't it, uh...
I shoulda guessed it - typical womanly behavior. Just lucky we left before they came for us.
I am. Hur you?
Well that all depends. You boys do Negro songs?
I been calling for four months.
Yeah, I made some money down there, then I talked my way into another college and I did it. I wasn't magna cum laude but I did okay. You should've seen me in my cap and gown.
Back east in Newport, Rhode Island, they call 'em the Fall River Debs. In Pensacola, the Mobile Debs. In Norfolk --
The whole world's a jungle, huh, Mayo? Dog eat dog down to the last one, right?
You got it, Sweet Pea.  Nice boonies, Seeger.
How did you slip into this program, Mayo? I didn't know the Navy was so hard up.  You got an injury there, Mayo?
Subic Bay, sir. In the Philippines.
Mayo, you didn't hear me -- I said I I'm busy! And so are you! Go get cleaned up!
No.
I don't believe what I'm seeing! Where've you been all your lives, at an orgy? Listening to Mick Jagger and bad mouthing your country, I'll bet.
Yeah.
Don't worry. I'll respect you afterwards.
If you won't take me to dinner with your parents, I won't meet you at the motel.
But... but what would we do? Where would we go?
One more minute.
Don't worry. It grows out about an inch by them.
I told Zack about Saturday night, too. The fifth week's supposed to be the roughest. Come Wednesday, he'll be wishing he took my number.
He'll show. I'd bet my paycheck on it.
What do you mean?
I never used to think I'd do something like that, but now I'm not so sure. You ask me, nine weeks just ain't long enough to get a guy to fall in love with you.
No more backward, if you ask me, than the way these hotshot assholes fuck us, then ditch us.  Don't you ever feel used, Paula? Don't you ever feel like if this is all you get for your trouble then the sonofabitch ought to be paying for it...?
Lynette, just keep your mouth shut until we get to the motel. Will you do that for me, please.
Well, excuse me for livin'!
Yeah. We've lived all over the world. Katmandu, Moscow, Nairobi.
It sure was.
They found them like that, shriveled up from weeks without food or water...
I understand. Maybe we'll see each other after the show...
I've seen all that a hundred times.
Some day. When I'm sure I can do a better job of it than my folks.
Paula, he DORed and nobody's seen him.
Beware of the Puget Debs -- and we all laughed, especially him.
I'm not a Puget Deb. I hate that goddamn term!
However you got it figured, I didn't kill Sid and Lynette didn't kill him! He killed himself!
My girl back home. We're supposed to get married after I get my wings. She was Tommy's girl. They were engaged to be married before he died.  I should've told you about her. I don't know why I didn't, except I didn't want you to think I was a shit for making it with Lynette.
But it can't wait.
Zack, it wasn't him! He didn't ask me to D.O.R. I came to him on my own.  I'm glad it's over, Zack. I really mean that. He was right. I wasn't doing this for me.
I don't want Raoul to administrate that part.
Peace out.
There is not one thing funny here.
What do you think?  Get us into that room.
That's their problem.
A guy shows you a gun, Burnham, and you insult him?  Hey, who's the idiot?  Huh?
Close?  Are you insane?  We're nowhere near close!  Fuck this, I'll make an anonymous phone call on Monday, they'll find the floor safe, and I'll inherit the shit.  Little piece of it, anyway, it's better than nothing.
Lookin' doubtful there, Big Guy, but ten out of ten for attitude.
We'd like to come in.
Oh, that phone call...
The hotel guy?  It's been in the papers lately.  His kids are all suing each other over his estate. He was a total recluse, paranoid, rich as hell, he was worth thirty million or something, now it turns out they can't find half of it.  Somebody took something didn't belong to them!
Not at all.
I'm just saying, the man is a problem.  And he's your problem. Wasn't me idea to bring him along.
He puts his hands on me again I'll bury a slug in his ear.
How many more do we have after this?
Got us in here, didn't I?
478...
That room!
They're coming in here, aren't they?
Little bit.  Yeah.
No.
Oh shit Alma... you're...
I tell you "officer", it wasn't...
Well as the Rev says, God helps those who help themselves.  We'll be our own stoplight.
Like, you Inspector Brimmer are not going to be sitting in your car anymore. I think it's time for a more active type of involvement.
Yeah.
Get out of the fucking car.
Yeah, it's me.
Who fucking cares? You cops killed Cy. And before you bastards kill anyone else, I'll give you your fucking set up. That make you happy??!!
Brimmer you're fucked up...
Damn straight.
Man... fuck you. Why you always bustin' my balls? All that high and mighty militant shit. I ain't doing nothing.
Look this is bull...
No man. PE -- "political education."
Cy... I ain't even sure.
Naw... I gotta...
It's a bit more like how can we help you. Bay Area's become quite a hornet's nest in terms of subversive activities. And... well Mr. Hoover wants to reiterate that the FBI will be happy to assist local authorities in any way we can. On a strictly advisory basis... of course.
No I'm not. I'd like to say, frankly and off the record, that I resent the Bureau's presence here. "Advisory Basis" or not. And, once we get these boys put away and the Panthers permanently discredited, I'd appreciate it if you'd leave us to take care of our own. Now I'm finished.
...no full fledge alliance. But I think we should do a rally with them. Show that there's some common ground between Black and White. You all with that?  All right then Eldridge, set it up.
I refuse to answer the question on the grounds it might incriminate me.
Not good enough Rodgers. Not good enough at all. Black terrorists on the floor of a State Capitol. I will not say this again, these Negro Commies are to be stopped and now. You tear them down. Either from the outside or the inside.
You mean...
Yeah... but it seems they're bringing Malcolm's widow Betty Shabazz to town, to speak at a rally, do an interview for Ramparts.  And they want us to help with security.
We need money first...
We're like policing the police.
Where you been? I saw the cops rousting you at the rally.
Yeah... let me think about it.
What, I don't know how you mean?
You fit the profile, Brother. You look exactly like the kind of nigger they think they can trust...
Like the manual says, "Information is...
But nothing... you do live here don't you?
No man No!! Tyrone listen... we got to move man, they got a warehouse...
Look... You... take her and get the hell out of here. I'll keep 'em busy.
Ain't no one seen him.
No... wait, there's something else, something weird. I hear he's set up down at that warehouse on fifty deuce. He's talking big and living bigger.
You call that a compliment?
His journals, letters, maps, books...
Oh, right.  Baking powder, we need baking powder.
We've got plenty of baking powder. You went to Pembroke and got five pounds two weeks ago.
What unit?
As you wish.
Please accept my apology for not having done so sooner.
And what are inappropriate levels of hostile attention?
Prisoner exchange.
Sir?
I do have eighteen criminals under sentence of death, but I hold no prisoners-of-war.
And if I triumph, you triumph.
The middle colonies?
Poor Richard says they'll make a Declaration of Independence by July.
Is that why the Assembly was convened?
Yes.
You're in no condition to ride.
I have no choice, I...
Flanking riders?
We're low on salt.  I should go to Pembroke and get some.
When was that?  In the swamp at the expense of your men?  Or when he killed Thomas at the expense of your family?
You know what happened.
That the French and Cherokees captured the fort and when you retook it, you took revenge on them for what they did during the occupation.
Your mother asked me the same question around the time you were born.  I was drunk and I was foolish enough to answer her.
I see, do as I say, not as I do.
I don't care.  I hate him.
Please.
And your principles?
I'm sorry.
So now Cornwallis will head north, link up with Clinton and finish off Washington.
They're nothing but farmers and you're asking them to try to keep a tiger in their backyard.  They'd be better off letting it move on.
No.  It's not over yet.  Two days ride, Yorktown, Virginia. Washington, the French, Cornwallis and Tarleton.  It will end, one way or another.  Francis, nothing will replace your sons but helping us will justify their sacrifice.
Goodbye, Harry.
Yes, quite, but you should know that...
For what?
For trying to impose some decency on that sort.
Don't depend on my decency.  I'm one of that sort.
About a hundred and twenty.  Less than a third.
He looks as if he's sleeping, doesn't he?
That bad?
And what is the second thing?
But it's already been two years and that's two more years.  The war could be over by then.
Don't blame yourself, you did what I told you to do.
Ayuh.
He can if He wants to. He can do anything, just like Inspector Gadget on TV. But I have to keep things ready for him, that's what I think. I've got his picture and I'm going to sit in his chair--
Yaay!
It doesn't seem long to me. It seems short. I think the whole thing about pets dying s-s-sucks!
Fine...except when Mom was airing Gage's diaper rash, he walked away and got into Grampa's study and pooped in Grampa's favorite chair.
Yes.
I know.
I hate that smell.
Daddy, do you think Missy Dandridge went to heaven?
I won't...is Missy in heaven, do you think?
I don't know, honey. Different people believe all sorts of different things happen to us when we die. Some believe in heaven or hell. Some think we're born again as little children--
Well, it's actually reincarnation, but you get the idea. And some people think we just wink out...like a candle flame when the wind blows hard.
Because your mother and I need the rest, sugar. Now buzz.
Same here. Come over and visit when you get the chance.
Sure.
Nope. The Micmac Indians. What's up ahead is all that's left of their tribal lands.
I think it is so, Ellie.
Me neither. But I believe in knowing your enemy.
You going to bury him in the Pet Sematary?
Does she love the cat?
Nothing.  Do we plant him on the outer circle or start a new one?
The place we're going is on the other side of that.
You'll see before long. Let's go.
No, I'm okay. Will I really be able to dig him a grave? The soil looks thin.
Your cairn.
Why, saved a little girl from being unhappy...that's all. Drink up, Louis!
Because something called a wendigo soured the ground.
Come on--let's parole 'em.
---and you'll end up doing a free consultation on his arthritis or urinary problems and---
Did you see his shirt?
I'm sure.
That boat is my livelihood!
And Jack.  And the crew.  Free and unharmed.  If you agree ... then ... I will remain with you.
Quite, boy, or you'll lose your tongue.  Those as know me know I wouldn't cross my word, and bring down bad luck on the ship.  I agreed to set them free.  I didn't when ... nor where.
He didn't waste it.
You're setting me up for a double cross, you with the ship, and me with nothing more than your word!
I'll watch my back.
By the powers, you're right!  Where's Jack's pistol?  Who's got it?  Bring it forward!
No, no, nothing like that.  Very well.  You hand that over, we'll put your town to our rudder and ne'er return.
Can I trust you?
Yes, I'm all right, I'm fine!  Go capture him.
You're speaking up for him again?
Then I can wear men's clothing.
Or, rather, Commodore Norrington ... a fine gentleman, don't you think?  He fancies you, you know.
I guess you can never truly know someone else's heart.
I saved your life; now you've saved mine.  We're square.
You're in league with Barbossa!
No, I'm -- rescuing you.
Last time, I was here a grand total of three days.  Last time, the rumrunners who used this island as a cache came by, and I bartered passage off.  But from the looks of this, they've been out of business, and so that won't be happening again.  We probably have your friend Norrington to thank for that.
One, because it is a vile drink that turns even the most respectable men into scoundrels. Two --
Exactly.
Exactly.
That he is.
What?  He never told me that.
Smith.
They left me stranded.  Twice. What have you got to lose?
I'll be at the wheel myself.
I'll slip in, talk them into to come out, and you'll be free to blow holy high heaven the whole lot of them.
You need to find yourself a girl.  Or maybe the reason you practice three hours a day is you've found one -- but can't get her?
Where does it make berth?
The worst.  On the other hand, maybe I'm a man who can't pass up a chance for revenge against the black-hearted bastard who stole my ship and left me to die in the middle of the ocean -- twice! -- and who knows how to get what he wants.  Now that's a great pirate.
You've seen it?
Yes.
You've seen the Black Pearl?
You've seen a ship with black sails that's crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out?
... No.
He's not telling the truth.
Please.
Dammit, man, it appears someone is stealing your ship!
Dr. Bright has escaped.
Come with me, Susan.  I want to show you something.
Does that mean Oppenheimer loved the atomic bomb?
Susan, I sense you are having difficulty understanding the situation you are presently in.  I ask that you keep in mind that I am ready to reduce an entire city to gelatin to get what I want.
A light mixture of oxygen, dioxide, and sodium pentothal.  He'll sleep, that's all.
Maybe you should, but you can't.
That's right.  And making me was the biggest mistake you ever made!
It's ready now, I know it is.
Nebbleman.
Do you think she loves him?
Then you still love me?
If you honestly trust me, then you'll have to trust me.
Not that.
Well, yes.  The replicators are not as active at low temperatures.
Poppy, order the trucks from the Gary plant.  And we're going to need a containment crew.
You don't want this.
Why don't you just shove it up your ass!  Haw-haw!
You better quit pushing me, pal.
They also tried using viral R.N.A. as the bonding element.
What I've always done.  As long as I'm the only one who can build the nanobot, I'm the only one who can say when it should be tested.
Argon is a lunatic!  I can't believe I was stupid enough to believe I could control him.  You heard what he said, Nigel.  He doesn't care if all of Calumet City is turned to Jell-O.  How can that not affect you?
I think that either you're going to give them to him or he's going to make you give them to him.
So, I guess it worked.
Oh yeah.  See, Susie, a man doesn't do the hard time and just pick up where he left off.  Oh no.  The big house does things to a man.
The big house.
Sure.  Can I ask you one more thing? You haven't published anything in a while.  How come?
We don't?
The problem is the by-product created by the process.
Means?  Oh no.  We won't know what it means until the end of the story and maybe then it won't seem quite as funny to you, Doctor Frankenstein!
It's a crime fighting costume, what do you think?  It's underwear, so if you lose your clothes you'll still be decent.
On the counter.
I can't go back to jail.  I gotta get out of here.
I'm not leaving without you, Susan!
Did you think I could just leave you...?
It's a miracle.
I don't mind her if you don't.
No - give you another guess.
For what?
You don't wear garters!
Say, you could do anything with me you wanted to. Putty - just putty, that's me.  Now getting back to those eyes of yours - would you mind if I kind of got closer so I could see them?
Not if you're going to lose any sleep about it.
How-di-do.
None of your ideas can be goofy, Stew, if they concern me.
Now let's get this settled—
You wear them of course, silly.
Oh, no I won't my dear - oh, no I won't my dear - I'll wash behind my ears, but no I won't my dear!
Oh yes you will wear garters—
Gallagher?
Yes, I said it. Sure, I said it. I didn't say it for publication, however.
What are you talking about?
What am I going downstairs and tell those people?
That's exactly what you mean. Heaven knows you've made that clear to me often enough. Well, I'm sick and tired of it. I've given you party after party - I've taken you to some of the best houses in this town - and introduced you to people of importance - and are you grateful? No! You insult them and act like a bore. I'm sick and tired of having to make excuses for you and the things that you've done. Perhaps it's just as well you're not coming tonight. Maybe I can enjoy myself for once without having to worry about you, and what you're going to do.
O-o-oh, I get you—  All right. All right. I don't blame you. I kinda forgot myself for a moment, there. That's what I call getting me told, isn't it, Anne?
That's ridiculous.
All right, I'm a child. Have it any way you want. But I'm going back to my own apartment, where I should have lived in the first place. But no, I got to listen to you and move here. All right. If you want to live with me, Anne, okay. But the sign outside will say "Mr. Stew Smith" and you'll have to be "Mrs. Stew Smith" or there's nothing doing. No more Anne Schuyler's husband—He has his bag all packed by this time. He snaps it shut viciously, lifts it off the chair, picks up his hat, and notices Mrs. Schuyler staring open-mouthed at him.  —and here's some more news for you. You can take your red room, your green room, your left wing and your right wing, and you know what you can do with them!  Come on, Gallagher.
Splendid, Mother. Let's hop over to Monte Carlo. It's a great place to save a face.
I was so worried for fear he'd knock over a vase or something. I must have acted like an idiot.  What does it say about the reception last night?
Oh, the usual thing. Blah, blah, blah attended the blah, blah reception and wore the same blah, blah things.
Oh, man!
Is that so?
Yale '21, I believe.
As one Tribune man to another—
Oh, is that so?
Excuse me, Gallagher. I wouldn't miss this one for the world.
Yeah.
With me you can always do business.
Get going where? I can write that yarn without stepping out of the office.
Why not?
What play?
Sure.
No?
'For he's only a bird in a gilded cage, a beautiful sight to see—'  Tweet, tweet - ha, ha—
I like my bath all right. How do you like your bath?
Thank you, sir.
I'm Miss Wilson - Mrs. Schuyler's social secretary.
Yes.
I bet.
You newspaper people have a lot of fun with him, don't you? What is it you call him - the Cinderella Man?
I hope not . . . I've got to call on her this morning!
There you go, talking like a woman!
Say, what kind of a pal are you? You're not going to leave me flat?
I knew you would, pal.  A bird in a gilded cage, eh?
I dyed one and washed the other.
Right!
Yes.
It'll be ready in a minute.
Rumors? Rumors? Since when is a breach-of-promise case a rumor?
You quit trying to stop anybody—
Traps shut!
No, I have no idea - unless some of the silver-ware is missing.
Surely, come right in.
And now for that twentieth crack—
Now Hank, are you sure they're coming?  It will be lonesome without them.  Smythe, take this crowd in there and give them a drink. And find out what the boys in the back room want!
Are the cars ready?
I beg your pardon?
Yes, I'm sorry, I struck him right here in your house. And I'll strike anybody in anybody's house that calls me a Cinderella Man.
Anne Schuyler, are you going to sit there and watch this man insult us? Haven't you any decency left?
Joan of Arc! What's it to you?
I understand, sir.
Now the lady said you may go—
Yes. Have you looked in the closets all over . . .?
Smythe! I mean - when you're alone and want to amuse yourself, then what?
A bird in a gilded cage?
That's all I wanted to know!
What do you mean?
It doesn't matter.
No. I want to know.
It can't be possible.
I'm fine.
What?
I had to say goodbye.
... It's a pretty short trip.
I think it looks nice.
Here's my favorite.
Yeah. It does.
Oh, George ...
"Changes."  And it's not just the fire or big stuff like that. It's little things.  Did you hear about Bill Miller?
Wife wants him to get one of those new beds.
Very well ...
BECAUSE I WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO TURN THIS COURTROOM INTO A CIRCUS!
But see that's just the point. It can't stop at once. Because it's in you. And you can't stop something that's in you.
Um ... I don't know how to do that, Bob.
Well, I never had to do it before.
How'd you know how to put it out and all?
I thought the books were blank?
Oh yeah. A Buick. It's swell.
Upstairs! Up-staiiirs! There isn't any STEREO!
You--you gotta get us out of here.
I don't know ... It's not possible ...  Is it possible?
I've worn some kinky stuff before ...
So what's the point?
Really? It seems so fattening.
... Yeah.
Sure.
Well--did she really like me or were you just making that up.
You weren't playing a joke? She woulda gone out with me?
What?
This thing works. We could go home right now.
Oh, no ... You baked those for Whitey.
No. I baked them for you.
Look, I probably shouldn't be asking you this--not knowing you that well and all ...
Sounds fantastic. You know some kids came up here the other night to go swimming--took off all their clothes.
Well it's big. And it's blue ...  ... It's really really blue.
I'm not sure.
Easy. Mr. Jenkins. What JOB did Mr. Jenkins have?
Well that makes it a lucky day for both of us, hunh?
No. McIntire's. Remember:  "For the very best in men's attire, Head right down to McIntire's."
That's right.
But you don't know how long I've been looking for someone like you.
Maybe in a day or so when I'm not so emotional ...
What?
I didn't do anything wrong.
Well--I always wipe down the counter and then you set out the napkins and glasses and then I make the french fries ...
Oh. Okay. I'll try that then.
I don't know what I'd do if I couldn't paint anymore Bud. I just don't know what I'd do ...
That's not the reason. I've got a date at six thirty.
What happened?
This isn't funny! I happen to have a very important date in like five minutes!
Yeah ... Saw you too.
Well it's just not true. We wouldn't be looking at you -- why are you wearing this suit? Did you say hello to your brother in law's?
This is "Fly With Us?"
D&D Mattress Man.
Hello.
So you're coming tonight, right?
Yes, indeed, yes I am.
There's this girl, this friend of mine from work that I think is really cute and really cool and I want you to meet her so I was thinking about bringing her to the party tonight.
It's a free country, we can look at you if we want to.
Yes but I get tense and I feel like I can't be myself if that happens.
Did I say that?
I'm not, I'm very happy.
I'm sorry.
I'm not gonna rag you. Why would I do this just to rag you?
I don't know.
No she didn't; that's a lie.
Hi. This is Jack.
Where are you?
Well. I have no way of knowing. So it doesn't matter.
What do you mean, "really?" Yeah. Really. What about you?
It doesn't matter.
...yeah.....
Does Jack like to Jack Off?
Yeah....do you do well, do you make alotta money?
You're going to work now?
Yes, no, yes. I can't. I can't afford that. I'm sorry. Sorry.
You have trouble, financial trouble?
Yes I can't....I don't make enough money to be able to do that.
Why did you tell me you did, then?
This is....illegal....I'll call the police.
....this is your mistake....
Do you know them.
Ok.
Hi.
Sure.
How long have you known her?
No, no. I did.
That's insane. That is really, really crazy. That's just crazy if you spend three thousand dollars on pudding.
My friend Carlos is doing it who works with me. It's his. It's his pudding, he's doing it. It's not mine. He's crazy. I told him not to do it. He's the one who's insane. He only spent about one hundred dollars so far though --
Did something happen; are you alright?
Yes I'm fine. Everything is ok. It's fine. Everything is fine.
Well, it's fine. Thank you.
Yes? I'm trying.
Really?
HI. WHERE ARE YOU? ARE YOU HERE?
Well let's do something do you want to do something, can you meet me?
yeah.
Yeah......yeah.....
I know what you mean, I know what you mean, I get this feeling --
For work.....
It's ok to ask that.
I thought that you were anyway.
Right. Alright, lemme call you first thing tomorrow, I'm gonna run the numbers, see what's what and I'll give you a call back --
I'm fine, I have your work number.
Ok.
Your hand is bleeding.
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
Sir, I have no way of proving that you demolished the bathroom --
Please don't do this to me.
......and this is confidential?
337.....I'm sorry....
Can you say that my name is Jack?
Hello, my name is Barry Egan and I called your service --
....I have seven.
Hi Walter.
Yes I'm fine.
So what should I do with the pudding?
I think I got in trouble. A little bit of trouble....
I'm sorry, I know. I know that it's....
Hi, Kathleen, I'm just working.
What time are you gonna be there?
Ok.
I know.
You can't just stay in your house.
Yeah but I'm serious.
Don't puss out.
As soon as you want.
You don't need to talk all macho, "shake him out, little bad boy." Whatever -- you're not an action hero, tough guy, you're not a gangster --
Are you sure?
Are you coming to eat with us?
Ok. What should I do about Eric?
They've the satisfaction only a hard day's labor can provide.
We've still a few lone incurables. Prone to violence, to perversion.
We oughtn't be reading his nasty stories --
I think she's sweet on him, that's what I think.
I haven't been to see the Marquis for ages. And I won't -- ever again -- I swear it. I won't speak to him, I won't even utter his name --
Is that a promise you can truly keep?
It's true, dear-heart, you've spoiled me pink.
Don't be so sure.
There I was taxed; it's true.
But we also fall in love; we build cities, we compose symphonies, and we endure. Why not put that in your books as well?
Fuck 'em! They're half-wits and pinheads. Let 'em die on the streets, as Nature intended.
And my chaise -- am I being denied the privilege of sitting -- of plopping down my ass --
Its horrors, perhaps! Its darkest nightmares! And to what end? Nothing but your own morbid gratification --
I could be convinced to abandon my writing, quite voluntarily.
A night spent with the partner of my choice.
-- that was lust --
Of course.
His wife's?
For sale? To the general public? Certainly not; it's unprintable.
-- then I've friends of my own to visit.
HER NAME, ABBE.
And my own.
Of course, Your Highness. Nevertheless... cure the Marquis de Sade... succeed, where countless physicians and priests have failed...
I'm afraid so; he's an idealist. You'll have to be politic.
I don't shed tears over the past, Monsieur Delbenè; I look to the future.
You? Frighten me? That's a good one! I'm twice as fast as you are. Who'd have thought such a spent body can still boast such a fertile mind?
You demand a lot from your readers, you do.
What's that then?
You're far crueler than I, my sweet.
How do you propose I write it? With dust, upon the air?
Yes! You shall. Of course you shall --
But you've a pension, haven't you, from the sale of his books?
What a beautiful thought, Marquise.
But it's just begun --
I'd rather read, thank-you.
Thing that bothers me now, though, looking back is that I really think I could have been something ... special.
Uh-huh
But I am That's the killer, honey.
Hope you don't mind my popping in--
You know that can't happen.
Nothing for you to worry about, darling
It's not really--
One . . . buys things.
I am not that woman.
You are being typically theatrical, Marion. I need the Tribune to--
You will not walk out on me
You are slovenly and unattractive and I won't  t-t-t-tolerate it.
No, you don't. You want to condemn me, like everyone else. You want to point to the pathetic, old man grown lunatic with his spending -- trapped in his ridiculous
The drinking.
I pay you a good deal of money to be my eyes and ears in Hollywood, do I not? If you cannot provide this simple service you are of no use to me.
Please be quiet.
Good. Retain that feeling. Let it nourish you from this day forth. It shall nourish us both
"You talk about the people as if you owned them. As though they belonged to you. As long as I can remember, you've talked about--"  Orson, I am so goddamn tired--
"You don't care about anything except you. You just want to persuade people that you
You're not doin' Hearst, are you?
Good God no! The character is a delicious amalgamation of various press barons--
A delicious amalgamation, is it?
Orson, hold on. Look into my eyes. Tell me you are not doing Hearst.
No -- no -- I mean--
Nonsense
Right-
Christ, we gotta go! The old man doesn't cotton to lateness.
No, it's perfect! When in doubt, put on a cape! False noses and faux beards and flowing capes have been the life-blood of the actor's craft since the days of lrving and Booth.  Imagine me in a glittering suit of lights on the dusky Andalusian plains--
We're doing Hearst.
Sorry to disappoint.
Don't do this
Then let him. What have we got to lose, you and I?
Why her?
It's too late. The movie's made
I told you this was going to happen! I told you he was going to come after us! So we took the chance anyway and we lost. That's how it goes, okay? I got my check, kid, and so did you -- and that's what it's all about -- so fuck it and move on.
Mank!
Yeah, ain't it swell?
I, um, need an estimate on some jewelry I might wish to sell. But d-d-discretion is very important to me b-b-because I don't want anyone t-t-to, um, know that--
Pardon?
Do WAR OF THE WORLDS as a feature and everyone's happy. You make some money and New York's happy and you have a track record and then we'll move on to KANE.
"Do what you can"?! That's not good enough I
It's just that my movie is so-
No, we're jake. But listen-
It was fun, wasn't it?
About what?
For what?
You just take it easy, now. You'll do all right. Feelin' Ok?
What is it with you? Can't you talk? You got like a funny attitude. I can't figure you out, Joey. What's with you and the quick answers? You wanna get outa here fast?
No, I can't wait. You know when I wait? When it's important to wait. It's not important to wait for no steak. It's important to wait for Reeves to leave the ring. It ain't important to wait for no steak! I won that fight. So, I stayed in the ring, and that way I made sure everybody knew it. I shoulda knocked him out earlier, sonofabitch.
What're you, a cop? I'm goin' out -- business.
What're you talking about? He's a heavyweight. You're a middleweight.
What are you getting so hot about -- Tommy Como told him to come down here...
Yeah --
Go 'head.
Ah, no, no. I didn't bang her. I know her from around here, that's all. You want to meet her or what?
No, but Jake... how much abuse can you take.
I dunno. Maybe I don't deserve to win. I've done a lot of bad things. I dunno...
This Janiro's an up-and-coming fighter, this kid you gotta knock out. Knockout this fuckin' kid! I'm telling you, this is your step towards getting a shot at the title. Listen to me: I'm telling you. You been killin' yourself for three years. There's nobody left -- they're afraid to fight you. This Janiro's up-and- coming. He don't know. Fuckin' tear him apart, wipe him out! What are you worried about? Your weight? Look, even if you lose they're gonna think you're weak; they're gonna think you're not the fighter you used to be. They'll match you with guys they were afraid to match you with before, and then you'll kill them and you'll get your title shot. And if you beat this kid Janiro, they gotta give you a shot at the title because there's nobody else. Either way you win and you do it on your own -- just like you want it. All right?
Try talkin' to her. She's your wife -- ask her what's the matter.
Jack, if there was anything funny, I would tell you.
Sure, I'll keep an eye on her.
Where you been?
Ain't a cheek ever good enough for you? I never even kissed Mama on the mouth.
Well, that's what I mean.
You know, when you gave him a beatin'.
What do you mean, "you"?
It means I'm through with boxing. I'm tired with tryin' to make the weight anymore. I'm sick of thinkin' about weight, weight, weight.
Why did they have to stop it? Why did they have to stop it?
Don't talk. Keep at it. Jab, jab, jab. You're ahead on points.
You wanted to say hello, eh? I can't believe it. When did you fall outa heaven? Anyone ever tell you you're the most beautiful one here, princess of the pool. You got a baby face. Look at mine. Whatcha wanna meet me for?
I ain't ever talked to a movie star before.
No.
It's OK.
Do what I say.
But, Jake, I was just...
No, I'm not. I'm looking at you.
That he's got a pretty face.
You're hurting my arm.
I called. You weren't there.
You're not only an animal, you're a stupid animal.  You're rotten.  Rotten.  Rotten.  You're a sick maniac. A maniac! You belong in a mental hospital.
Yeah --
Tell him how you feel -- you miss him. Tell him you're sorry.
Aw, c'mon. Don't say that.
I promise I just gotta pick up one thing.
Can't you get the money from your friends?
This Janiro's a good fighter, pretty good-lookin' kid.
Right, the gym.
Excuse me, I'm talking to my sister in-law.
That's right, take his part. You're his brother. He's never gonna be champ. Too many people are against him.
I'll pull somebody out of Japan.
When the lock is broken -- yes.
Didn't you take it to the crime lab?
Go ahead, Doyle -- tell me he's an unemployed magician -- amusing the neighborhood with sleight-of-hand.
Almost everything's been done -- under panic. But this is a thousand to one shot. That man's still sitting around his apartment; he isn't panicked.
You think I made all this up?
I was jaywalking.
She never left the apartment --
Six ayem.
Not yet.
I can't do that.
I can hear myself starting out. "Your Honor -- I have a friend who's an amateur sleuth, an one night, after a heavy supper --"  He'd throw the New York State Penal Code right in my face. -- And it's six volumes.
A fact! Last night he killed a dog for pawing in his garden. Why? Because he had something buried in there. Something a dog could scent.
You think perhaps it was "old hambone?"
Precinct Six. I sent a friend over with bail money.
You did.
Stop sounding stuffy. I'll take pictures from a jeep. From a water buffalo if necessary.
I'll give you a chance to find out. Meet me in the bar at the Brevoort -- and do it right away.
Tell her to bring it back!
She's all right.
Too perfect. Too beautiful, too talented, too sophisticated, too everything -- but what I want.
That's the hard part.
How did you know!
Isn't he a salesman?
Flashlights. Luminous dials for watches. House numbers that light up.
Sometimes it's worse to stay than it is to run.
There's something buried there.
Miss Lonely Hearts just laid out something that looks like sodium trieckonal capsules.
No.
Uh-huh.
Who buys them? Tax collectors?
Going on right here. It's a big night.
Now that's no way to spend your hard- earned money!
I wanted to, Jeff.  Oh!
You have, perhaps, an ambulance outside?
She looked very cool. She had on a mint green --
It's ridiculous for you to say that it can only be done by a special, private little group of anointed people.
Jeff, you don't have to be deliberately repulsive just to impress me I'm wrong.
You mean "goodnight."
He likes the way his wife welcomes him home.
Homework. It's more interesting.
Something too frightful to utter.
I don't know what you consider it -- but if you don't stop it, I'm getting out of here.
You'd better before you catch the disease!
Where's the doctor -- the undertakers?
Maybe he's leaving his wife. I don't know, and I don't care. Lots of people have saws, knives and ropes around their houses. Lots of men don't speak to their wives all day. Lots of wives nag, and men hate them, and trouble starts -- but very, very, very few of them end up in murder -- if that's what you're thinking.
Don't you see how silly you're being?
And you, and you friend Doyle --  Did you hear from him again -- since he left?
Because she didn't know she was going on a trip -- and where she was going she wouldn't need a handbag.
You'll have to clear that through my landlord --
I do?
Staying the night here, uninvited.
You mean -- like the kitchen? And make us some coffee?
You and me with long faces -- plunged into despair -- because we find out that a man didn't kill his wife. We're two of the most frightening ghouls I've ever known.
It's just a picture of the backyard, that's all.
Shall we vote him in, Stella?
How 'bout you?  Say the word and you're cold, Jack--you're dead.
Okay.
Any other entrance?
You see any cops?
You mind if I try?  You have to slam the door in my face?  I try to get to him--what happens?  Don't I give you everything you want?  A bicycle--you get a bicycle. A car--
You buy me many things.  Thank you.
It's just this get-up.  The girl's out and I was bringing Mom's supper.
That's funny!
I wouldn't do anything hasty. Let's get a little light on the subject.
Listen--nobody should make a snap decision--This isn't something you just--we ought to consider all the pros and cons--
Well, now--
I was in it.
And you can depend on me, son. Trust me.  Whatever comes we'll face it together, I swear.
That's right!
Look--just relax, will you?
No, honey.  No, he's not here.
Head-shrinker?
No.  I don't think so--
He's a wheel.  So's she.  It's hard to make friends with them.
I don't want to make friends.
Jim.  What's yours?
Why don't you come home with me?  I mean nobody's home at my house--and I'm not tired, are you?  I don't have many--people I can talk to.
Hey...you flipped--or something? You better take off...
We know.
I'm here.  Shut up.
No.  I'm scared.
When was that?
You sure?
You trust me, don't you?  Just give it to me for a second.
Come on!
Mom--I'm not--
No!  You're not tearing me loose any more.
No.
Pretty mixed up?
You serious?
Where I saw you.  Everything going okay now?  You live around here?
You going there?
You were looking for me, weren't you?
No--I was just--maybe--
I tried to call you before. JUDY I thought so.
You see, we've just--oh, you tell him, darling.  I'm so embarrassed I could die!
Should we explore?
You disappointed?
It's not going to be lonely, Judy. Not for you and not for me.
I love you, Jim.  I really mean it.
Want to finish my hamburger?  I only took a bite.
Oh, we can manage that!  I'll scrimp and save and work my fingers to the bone...
What?
But the same song.  I think it's fantastic!
With us old creeps?  Come on, we have to eat.
Daddy--
...whoever she is.
I've been doing good, though.
Didn't have to hit me so fucking hard. Didn't have to throw me outta the goddamn truck.
He'll be dead when he does.
Toys for adults. Where are your toys for adults?
I can get another one going. Y'know, hey, whatever you want me to --
Had some bad relationships, didn't you.
Fifty percent off, motherfucker. Ho ho ho.
Ashley. We're not going anywhere I used to work.
Your brother...
He read the letters, Nick. Some day I wasn't there. He went through my room. He found your letters.
You sold him out.
Nick --
Jack. Jack Bangs.
Well, shit, Judas, you shoulda at least gotten that --
Nick! He wants to know how to rob it, and he'll leave you alone! That's all he wants!  I hate him, Nick... you know how...
So get him outta your life. Get out of Michigan. They got perfume counters in Chicago, don't they?
No. He wants to be working for himself someday.
What?
Gabriel and his guys. What's the last place they robbed?
Get your own room.
...Haven't had cranberry buns... in five whole years...
I'm almost done.
Rudy. How'd you know my name?
I never told you my name.
You what...
Yes!
A girl says she loves you, you say something.
At least gimme video poker.
You get recognized, convict, You get a country-western funeral.
Don't tip.
Six men means six guns.
What. We all gonna dress up like cowboys?
Not cowboys, Nick. Not cowboys.
What, we walking in there and delivering toys?
Get in there and watch 'em. Watch their every fuckin' move.
Show's over.
I'm putting liquor in the drinks, I'm giving 10-times odds on craps, I got the girls showing sixteen-percent more skin! Show me another buffet's gonna offer you Coke and Pepsi! Whaddya want me to do?!
Fuckin' freezing.
Not with you.
Yeah.
Me and her got a connection.  Read this part. Read the part about stuffing her stocking.
I'm ninety-two years old --
THEY'LL OPEN ONE!
Your boss even said there wasn't a set up.
Funny you should mention it. That's what your father and I been talkin' about.
That I should've picked you up?
Scagnetti? Oh shit, I hear he's a motherfucker.
You're coming back to work for us, right?
You don't hafta lift shit. You don't really work there. But as far as the records are concerned, you do. I call up Matthews, the foreman, tell him he's got a new guy. You're on the schedule. You got a timecard, it's clocked in and out for you everyday, and you get a pay check at the end of the week. And ya know dock workers don't do too bad. So you can move into a halfway decent place without Scagnetti thinkin "what the fuck." And if Scagnetti ever wants to make a surprise visit, you're gone that day. That day we sent you to Tustin. We gotta bunch of shit you needed to unload there. You're at the Taft airstrip pickin' up a bunch of shit and bringing it back. Part of your job is goin' different places - and we got places all over the place.
No shit, he's gonna fuckin' die on us if we don't get him taken care of.
This isn't all that bad. We can give you a lot of legitimate jobs. Put you on the rotation at Long Beach as a dock worker.
That's okay, Eddie, I do.
Would you stop it with that shit! You beat on this prick enough, he'll tell ya he started the Chicago fire. That don't necessarily make it so. Okay, first things fucking last, where's the shit? Please tell me somebody brought something with them.
I was in the sixth grade when that show was on. I totally dug it. What the fuck was the name of the chick who played Christie Love?
The Boots and Socks in Gardena. When we got there, I met Joe and a guy named Mr. White. It's a phony name. My name's Mr. Orange.
Yeah.
No, he ain't familiar. He ain't one of Cabot's soldiers either. He's gotta be from outta town. But Joe knows him real well.
A little.
A undercover cop has got to be Marlon Brando. To do this job you got to be a great actor. You got to be naturalistic. You got to be naturalistic as hell. If you ain't a great actor you're a bad actor, and bad acting is bullshit in this job.
Something funny that happened to you while you were doing a job.
I gotta memorize all this shit?
It's a change.
A guy named Scagnetti. Seymour Scagnetti.
What the hell did you expect me to do? Just forget about you?
Dead as Dillinger.
Sorry, it's my book now.
Mr. Pink.
Nope.
Frankie Ferchetti introduced us once, about five months ago.
What're you talkin' about?
You're not gonna fucking die, all right?
I can' take you to a hospital.
You could've asked the cop, if you didn't just kill him. He talked about what he was going to do when he was slicing him up.
Yeah, it's fuckin' great isn't it?
You don't believe in tipping?
Fuck all that.
This is so fucked up. Somebody fucked us big time.
Let's go in the other room...
The cops didn't show up after the alarm went off. They didn't show till after Mr. Blonde started shooting everyone.
A few cops.
That was one of the most insane fucking things I've ever seen. Why the fuck would Joe hire somebody like that?
That's the way I look at it. A choice between doin' ten years, and takin' out some stupid motherfucker, ain't no choice at all. But I ain't no madman either. What the fuck was Joe thinkin'? You can't work with a guy like that. That motherfucker's unstable. What do you think? Do you think he panicked, or ya think he's just trigger-happy?
I think he's a sick fuckin' maniac! We're awful goddamn lucky he didn't tag us, when he shot up the place. I came this fucking close -  to taking his ass out myself. Everybody panics. When things get tense, everybody panics. Everybody. I don't care what your name is, you can't help it. It's human nature. But ya panic on the inside. Ya panic in your head. Ya give yourself a couple a seconds of panic, then you get a grip and deal with the situation. What you don't do, is shoot up the place and kill everybody.
What you're supposed to do is act like a fuckin' professional. A psychopath is not a professional. You can't work with a psychopath, 'cause ya don't know what those sick assholes are gonna do next. I mean, Jesus Christ, how old do you think that black girl was? Twenty, maybe twenty-one?
Then where is everybody? I say the plan became null and void once we found out we got a rat in the house. We ain't got the slightest fuckin' idea what happened to Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue. They could both be dead or arrested. They could be sweatin' 'em, down at the station house right now. Yeah they don't know the names, but they can sing about this place. I mean, that could be happening right now. As we speak, the cops could be in their cars, drivin' here this minute.
What?
You gotta idea, spit it out.
Before you got here, Mr. Orange was askin' me to take him to a hospital. Now I don't like turning him over to the cops, but if we don't, he's dead. He begged me to do it. I told him to hold off till Joe got here.
You takin' his side?
Graham's got something to tell you might interest you.
But I'm going to have to leave 'em here. They're --- well they're not the sort of people you're used to.
It doesn't matter who they are.
You can't leave us here.
Mostly, we open a can of beans and boil some coffee.
Where do you keep the can opener?
And look at it this way. How about Jim -- it puts him in a sort of tough spot.
Oh, it did. It had a great deal to do with you.
Like I said, I was thinkin' of the horses.
I can't help how I think. You're trained a certain way when you're a kid and you can't change.
Maybe they will.
To the other side of the street.
A fellow sees a fire go out all of a sudden, he don't take chances. My name's Clayton and I'm looking for someone.
Like what?
Nice.
You sure worry that bone. He killed a fellow.
This is an awful nice gun.  Certainly come in handy when there's men around who shoot people that aren't lookin'.
Good thing you didn't.
I caught up with Lednov in Nogales. He didn't like the idea of comin' back across the border but he came. I turned him over to the sheriff and -- that's the story.
You'll get your share. Go on. I don't want you around.
Sure. What other reason would there be?
So -- maybe I'm old enough to tell you how to run your life?
What's botherin' you, anyway?
Not if I know Mary. When she rides into Sonora, you'll be with her. And mighty glad to be there after this. I don't see how you stood it as long as you did.
Depends on how good you drive.
I don't like to see you go.
There's still tomorrow morning.
Maybe you are. I'm not.
That's it then.
I don't know -- I don't know.
Because there's a man I want to see.
I said I had a guy to see and I'm going to see him.
Since I can remember, Ma'am.
Maybe I could start you out.
Good night, Steve.
That's the end of the line.
Hmmm... sort of like a horse -- with a horn in the center of its forehead.
Horses with horns! Huh! Do we have 'em in Nevada?
Then if they wasn't alive, how can they be an animal?...
Ha! Right bitch!
Oh, this is too much. I'm gonna have to play these numbers. Remind me to pick up a Lotto ticket.
Oh, yeah. I'm just curious about that kind of stuff.
So it looks like we're going to be spending the weekend together.
Gentle stuff like talking, sharing thoughts and ideas, secrets and past experiences. Stuff like that, you know.
Wait, I want to check something. Give me a hand.
Come on. There's a first aid kit in the lab.
I was thinking the same thing.
There's something I want to share with you too. Here, smell this.
Listen to me I --
Look, what I'm trying to say --
Thanks, I'll be fine.
Not in a thousand years.
I don't need your help.
Just wait, you'll see.
No, my friends are right here!
Aww, you ain't that bad. You just need a little flava. First thing we gotta do is get you some new gear.
You better go get Dwight and the Professor.
Are you?
I don't need your help. I'm perfectly capable.
Any of them hot?
Willing? I like that.  And, this one?
Right. What about condoms?
After dinner, you and I will take shifts throughout the night. I don't want to chance miss anything.
Yeah, I can see that. Later I want you to teach me that trick, but right now we have a job to do.
It's okay. I understand.
How is she?
Because she will lie?
Sweet. Hey, you got a tattoo, too.
Aww, man. You just need to chill out. Come on, there's this party tonight it's gonna be fun. Lot's of alcohol and honeys.
The "Citizen Kane" of gore movies.
Thanks, Mom.
But Mom, the video's not over.
No "but mom" for you, young man. Mr. Stubbins seems to think these silly movies are interfering with your studies. 
I'm sorry he's dead, but... have you signed off yet?
Suspect's family is headed east on Calverton....
Leave her alone, Chip.  I think it's great she has a new beau, Beverly.
Nice?! He should have been executed!
Oohhhh, Eugene!
Isn't this 4215 Pussy Way?
The police are tracing your call right this minute.
COCKSUCKER! 
Are those pussy-willows?
Marvin A. Pickles.
If you wouldn't mind...  It was on sale.
Ewwww!  Thank you, Rosemary.
There is one big problem though.
We have mice! I mean it, Ralph! I saw one!
Sure I do.
Look, sister', Manhattan is only nine miles long and four and one half miles wide. I ain't never been off it. I know it like you know your own back yard. You get me a small retainer --say fifty bucks, and I'll get your sister for you. I guarantee
You can't tell.
Then, you also understand that you must die.
No.
Yes.
I read your book. The one in which you wrote about the cure for drinking.
Oh, as beautiful as ever.
Hello, Frances.
How's Miss Jacqueline?
I don't know. That's why I came to see Mrs. Redi. I'm trying to find her.
I can't understand it at all.
Well, don't worry. I saw Miss Jacqueline only a week ago. I saw her at a little restaurant the boy friend took me to -- an Italian place down in the Village —-	"The Dante."
It's on Peary Street. Just ask the people who run it. They'll remember her.  People who see Miss Jacqueline never forget her.
Well, if it's fun for you, it's all right. I get a kick out of my work when the customers aren't too crabby.
I did her hair.
The Morgue? No wonder you fainted.  I wish you had come to me first.
Then you know where Jacqueline is?
But you do believe me?
But you have treated me that way.
I won't do it again. We're friends. I'll never order you about again.
Last night in this very restaurant Mr. Jason Hoag paid a very pretty compliment to my right ear.
We've tried so long to find her.
It will all be over in such a little while, Jacqueline, and everything will be all right again. Drink your coffee.
You don't even know Jacqueline Gibson.
I'm looking for a party -- a merry party.
But you're always at the library.
Some time before those nice white gloves are dry you're going to go and find out a few things about Mrs. Redi.
It's beautiful -- that searchlight - the stars --
Jacqueline. Mr. Romari phoned me. She went out this afternoon with two men he'd never seen before.
They may have been friends of hers.
Well, since, you're over twenty one——
What a peculiar question.
After that wonderful first book —- after all the adulation and the good reviews?
Why not let your publisher judge that?
I wanted to get things clear for Jacqueline. Let her know --
Perhaps
I'd like that.
You know where she is?
If I didn't know where she was, could I take you to her? Get your hat and coat. We haven't much time.
Because you are intelligent -- that's why they sent me to you --
I've talked nonsense. I've scoffed and hooted -- but somewhere very deep down in me, I always felt that good held the balance of power.
Leave me your address, and if I find anything, I'll get in touch with you.
That won't be necessary. I haven't much to say.
It will make you unhappy to find Jacqueline. It would put her in danger --- great danger --
Giacomo -- la bellisslina madonna —-
But she was here?
Of course.
I thought you might know her. She was seen here about a week ago. Her name is Jacqueline Gibson.
Why
Because I have something very important to do.
But he also wrote --
Then it is decided. Leo and Durk and I will make our plans.
I know. You introduced Jacqueline to us -- but how could you tell —-
Well... well, the cliché about the security of it, that's really true. We own a house, and I really like that, you know? And I like that John was just made junior partner, so he has a steady job and he's not some...
Yes. So you feel security, stability. Like things are going to last awhile.
Anyway, I think the mind is very flexible as far as time is concerned.
Why? Didn't you know him well?
I feel like they do.
Okay. I think... I think sex is overrated. I think people place way too much importance on it. And I think that stuff about women wanting it just as bad is crap. I m not saying women don't want it, I just don't think they want it for the reason men think they do.  I'm getting confused.
Agreed.
What?
I believe in it for some people. I mean, for me it was silly, I was confused going in. So I just formed my own personal theory that you should never take advice from someone of the opposite sex that doesn't know you intimately.
That's correct.  Bit of a dilemma, isn't it?
Ann. Hello.
I just wanted to see how the place looked furnished.
Who's Donna?
What about sex?
Yes.
No, not to me, for me, for the camera.
You know?
Why didn't you tell me?
Why not?
Don't you want to make one?
Yes.
At some level, I don't understand your nervousness. Have you decided to leave John?
That's correct.
I loved her for how good she made me feel, and I hated her for how good she made me feel. And at that time, I tended to express my feelings non- verbally. I couldn't handle anyone having that much control over my emotions.
No, you're not.
Ann, it could happen to me all over again, don't you see? I could start to --
All right!! All right!! You want to know? You want to know how I feel? I feel ashamed. Is that what you wanted to hear?
No, Ann, I can't. I can't forget it. It's not something I can fix. It's difficult. There s something in my mind... the way my brain works...  God, Ann, when you're with another person, and you're... inside them, you're so vulnerable, you're revealing so much... there's no protection. And... somebody could say, or do something to you while you're in this... state of... nakedness. And they could hurt you without even knowing it. In a way that you couldn't even see.  And you would withdraw. To make sure it didn't happen again.
Did you see a message to call me when you got back in?
There's nothing to know, Ann.
Is that supposed to comfort me?
I'm not either!!
Why don't I believe you?
You've made your point.
I'm sorry. It's just... I'm under a lot of pressure with this Kirkland thing, it's my first big case as junior partner, and I work all day, I come home, I look forward to seeing you, and... it hurts that you accuse me like that.
Loud.
I know.
Nothing. I mean, nothing. I try not to do anything that will produce garbage, so obviously we're talking about eating and basic stuff like that. Did you know that the average person produces three pounds of garbage a day?
About a week ago. I don't know what brought it on, I just started feeling like I didn't want him to touch me.
But see, he stopped before I got that feeling, that's why it seems weird to me. I mean, I'm sure he wishes I would initiate things once in awhile, and I would except it never occurs to me, I'm always thinking about something else and then the few times that I have felt like starting something I was by myself.
Let me rephrase. Were you attracted to him?
You know what. You say it just to irritate me.
Well, I wonder why.
Oh, please. Okay, so give me the Zen master's address, I'll think of a reason to stop by.
And... do whatever it is you do.
I was thinking maybe I shouldn't be in therapy anymore.
No, he's not dangerous. Not physically.
You are in serious trouble.
Ann, I don't understand why this freaks you out so much. You didn't do it, I did, and if it doesn't bother me, why should it bother you?
Well. I can't stay.
No.
Do I know you?
Yes.
Whichever you prefer.
Your first sexual experience.
I was... eight years old. Michael Green, who was also eight, asked if he could watch me take a pee. I said he could if I could watch him take one, too. He said okay, and then we went into the woods behind our house. I got this feeling he was chickening out because he kept saying, "Ladies first!" So I pulled down my underpants and urinated, and he ran away before I even finished.
Prettier than Ann?
I'd like to make another tape.
Meaning we'll have to cool it for awhile, right?
Right.
In here!!
I don't think my sister would agree.
Right.
It's just something I'd prefer she didn't know about.
You realize you have no recourse legally? This stuff could show up anywhere.
I can't believe I let him stay in my house. Right under my nose. That deviant fucker was right under my nose and I didn't see him.
I like having the car, the car is important.
She's not property, John, she's a person. Were you just going to keep right on lying to her?
Okay, in a minute, I'm on with a client.
He said immediately.
You're the one who found the bodies?
You knew these people?
Far as I know, yeah, that was her.
Yeah. This is an island, you know? Takes too long to get into the city. We gotta have everything right here or somebody complains.
Down to the incinerator.
OK. I'll meet you back there. Don't leave until I get there. Lock the door and don't open it except for me. OK?
Oh, but the nurse, she went away. I think she must go to look for you.
It's crazy.
Lemme clarify for you.
Yeah.  Ah, I don't want to panic you or anything, but, I mean, the way Hobbes designed them, they're supposed to get out of hand real quick, so you don't have much time to think about what's happening to you. Once they decide to start pumping all those dynamite juices into the old blood stream... I dunno. But if you see some people doing kind of compulsive, maybe even bizarre sexual things...
I dunno. Try tranquilizers. Once you can get at them, there's a lotta stuff you can use. I'll bring a bagful. It's just the standard tropical kit. But the trick is to get at them.
OK, Rog. See you at ten.
Of course.
A wreck.
WELL FIRST YOU GO RIP RIP RIP THEN YOU GO SNIP SNIP SNIP THEN YOU WHIP IN A ZIP ZIP ZIP AN' YOU SPLIT IT UP TO THE HIP HIP HIP AN' AS YOU STRIP STRIP STRIP YOU QUIVER AND SHIVER FOR THAT SOFT CARESS AS YOU SLIP SLIP SLIP...INTO THAT LITTLE BLACK DRESS
Why Janet?
Everyone loves the girl next door, particularly Farley.
They probably meant Irving and wanted you to swing.
Farley is already a TV winner as we shall see.  Dentonvile will run forever now that his interest has embraced mental hygiene.
Oh, Oliver, you're so tolerant. Time for a coffee before you rush off?
Isn't that Brad and Janet Majors sitting down front?  What an ideal couple.
Now Betty, don't overreact.
Oh I adore Coleridge Taylor.  As a matter of fact...
We've got to, Brad, everyone's watching.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT TO BE FUNNY
Could you tell us a little about it?
Let's just say that I'm putting sanity back on the national menu.
And how does *'local girl'* Janet Majors fit into the scheme of things?
That doesn't make sense.
I'm sorry, Officer.
I NEED SOME
Good!  Well there's still hope. Lots of hope.
Me?
Absolutely true.  Compared to all of them, you are perfection, flawless beauty.
Of course.  He was in great danger of harming himself.
F for...
YOU KEEP GOING BACK IT'S DRIVING YOU INSANE
THIS COULD TAKE US TO A TOWN THAT'S NOWHERE NEAR HERE
She walks in beauty...
We all love Janet...Who do we love?
Hang on. Did you ever know a Derek Sommersby?
I picked him up and I fucked him. I'm a bad girl.
I ask you one simple question, and suddenly I'm attacking you.
Hey, Evelyn, it's your favorite client.
How's the trip?
You're a wonderful writer, Miles. Don't be discouraged.
When's that novel of yours coming out?  We  all want to read it.
Hi.  Maya's in the kitchen.
Okay, there was a tasting last night. But I wanted to get us some stuff for the ride up. Check out the box.
Yes. Absolutely. Despite your crass behavior, I'm really glad we're finally getting this time together.
Yeah.
Color in the red wines comes from the skins. This juice is free run, so there's no skin contact in the fermentation, ergo no color.
How about the new ending? Did you like that?
I'd rather have a knife.
I'm working on it.
These guys make top-notch Pinot and Chardonnay. One of the best producers in Santa Barbara county.  Look how beautiful this view is. What a day!
Thanks, Jack. So do I.  Here we are.
Pinot noir? Not again!  You know, not all Pinots are noir.
Yeah, that would be a good move.
Just a minute!
It's not even a mile.
So you're going to stop acting?
So what's a professor's wife doing waitressing? Obviously that's over.
Why do you always focus on the negative? Didn't you see how friendly she was to you?
You're blind, dude. Blind.
No rock. When she came to the bar, sans rock.
She probably went home, lit some candles, put on some relaxing music, took a nice hot bath, and laid down on her bed with her favorite vibrator.
Fuck you.
You have the keys.
And if they want to drink Merlot, we're drinking Merlot.
We were supposed to play golf.
Okay! Jesus!
Um... not exactly. But I've been honest. I haven't told her I'm available. And she knows this trip up here is only for a few days. Besides...
Sure, whatever. Maybe I'll catch a movie.
Can you give me some room here?
Thanks, Jack.
What do you think's going on?
Why are you so hostile? I know you're frustrated with your life right now, but you can choose not to be so hostile.  Here.
Is an abattoir like a... like a... what is that?
We're going to have some fun. Remember fun? We're going to have some of it. Okay?
No.
Shut up! Shut up, Jack!
What's up?
Don't give up. You're going to make it.
See? Right there. Just what you just said. That's beautiful. A thumbprint on a skyscraper. I couldn't write that.
Huh. Let me think.
Ran. Twisted my ankle too.
You don't understand. The wedding bands. The wedding bands are in my wallet.
That was quite a day yesterday.
Oh, no, actually. Busy night.
The Windmill.
A Fiddlehead Sauvignon Blanc.
This is good. Little hints of clove.
Hey.
Not much of a collection really. I haven't had the wallet for that, so I sort of live bottle to bottle. But I've got a couple things I'm saving. I guess the star would be a 1961 Cheval Blanc.
Wow. Anyway, I think it's amazing you're getting it published. Really. I know how hard it is. Just to write it even.
Yeah. Thanks.
A paper?
I do have a copy of the manuscript in the car. It's not fully proofed, but if you're okay with a few typos...
Do you know what he's been saying to her?
But you wanted to fuck me first.
Miles, I don't care if you come to the wedding or not.
Well, I'm not coming, Barbie. So you guys have fun.
Thanks. Um, this is Ken Cortland, my husband.
We were thinking. Why don't we go back to my place? I've got wine, some insane cheeses, music, whatever.
Oh, that's right. Isn't that nice? I hope that girls knows how lucky she is, marrying no less than Derek Summersby.
It tastes old.
Does she ever answer back?
That's weird.
Who said I was going to die?
...Tell Graham --
What?  Colleen?... Colleen?
It's broken Morgan. It'll just keep doing this.  Let's get out of the car okay?
That's right.
That wasn't the answer you wanted?
Can you at least pretend to be like you used to be? Give me some comfort?
They already know we're here.
What are you doing?
Philadelphia and its outlying counties are cleared, but who knows for sure?
That means they're unemployed.
Don't yell at her!
Sorry.
I don't know whether to look for a midget or a --
It's like War of the Worlds.
What book!
You got me. This is a crazy town, Emmett. I think we ought to get out of here.
The one with the shotgun.
Chicago. Working in the slaughter- houses.
Yeah... maybe. So long.
Have to.
I just came out to say goodbye.
How's Mr. Parker doing?
Just like you'd think. But he's not going to run. We're sticking to our plan. Now we both need help.
And you're not Baxter, either?
In my town, when you're looking for someone, you ask me.
I want you out of town before the hanging.
C'mon, I'll buy you a drink.
All I'm saying is, you won't trip over me if you look her up.
I'm going to California with my brother.
Who?
What about the law?
Why, J.T., watch what you're saying around Augie. Emmett didn't kill anybody.
That ain't right.
Because I'm your sister.
You've got a legitimate job.
Stella, we still got an extra room out back, don't we?
So we understand each other?
Cobb, you've got nothing I need.
Not a thing. She's just a mutual friend.  But if you wind up on the wrong side of this, she's going to get hurt.
Yeah. Bad luck.  Good-bye, Cobb.
I don't own this place. The man who does stuck me with Kelly.
I'm saving lives here. The straight stuff would raise a blood blister on boot leather.
He says he doesn't care about anything, but he does. There's just no telling what it's going to be.
So, of course, you couldn't kill Simone because there never was a Simone.
I can't imagine how you ever let a man like that go.  I owe Viktor everything.
Excuse us.
Please.
No problem.  Do you want to come in?
She'll drive herself.
Simone does not control my destiny.
That's genius, Viktor.  Was that Simone's idea?
I should fire you more often.  The film's looking wonderful.
Everyone I know has met her, Viktor.
Not now.  She's emotional.  Her mother dies today.  Scene forty-two of "Good For Nothing".  It's not a good time.
Oh, yes.  Of course.  Don't I always?
Yes, you do...  Anyway, tonight was a good start.
I suppose I could stay, just until she arrives.
I know.  I know.  They'll say anything.
No, I will end my relationship with her -- totally.
But you don't understand.  She'll always be there -- at some party, on some magazine cover, some song on the radio, up on some screen.
-- She's a figment of my own imagination.  I, Viktor Taransky, have perpetrated the greatest hoax, the greatest sleight-of-hand, sleight-of-mouth, sleight-of- sleight in entertainment history! And still no one appreciates me, recognizes what I've done -- even you.
No!  Whatever talent Simone has comes from me -- me!  Me!  I swear, as God is my judge.  You don't know what I've been through.  Tens of thousands of mind-numbing hours in front of that screen, nights without end, and look what it's cost me.  Why do you think I've been wearing these?  I may have done irreparable harm to my eyesight, and why?  To extract and refine the infinite nuances of a human being -- a human soul.  Don't you see?  I made Simone!
How can you bring that up at a time like this?
Don't thank us too fast, Viktor. You know what we have to do?
Yes -- oh my, God.  Is that you, Simone?!  I've been wanting to talk to you.
Just a minute.
... so much like her?
What I do to Simone?
Simone?
Let's talk about the work that you care so much about.
Frank, you know as well as I do, living in a fish bowl, the insatiable appetite of the media...
Yes, perfect.  As a matter of fact, I ran into Simone on the lot the other day.
I'm fine, Hal.  How are you?
I was misquoted.
Come on, Hank.  A synthespian, virtual actor -- ?
I just came out to support my good friend, Simone.
I know you'll do it, Dad.  You're Viktor Taransky.
This week anyhow.
Why?
Those things can be dangerous. Staring at a screen all day -- you miss what's going on outside in the real world.  You can lose yourself. You should get out more.  How are you going to meet boys?
Exactly.  Don't you wonder where I'm really hiding Simone?
I know, Hal is as stiff as always.
Precisely.
I noticed.
I know.  Thank her for me.
It's from both of us.  Of course you'll have to drive it around the lot until you get your permit --
There you go again, blaming yourself.  Can't you see what she's done to you -- she's taking advantage, mocking you.  You deserve better than Simone.  I've got to go, Dad.
Me and Simone.  What I did.
An insanity defence.
What?!
This is the story.
They are alive, Sayer.
Maybe the reason she's with me is a little thing called integrity, Sayer.  Look it up.
It's a yacht.
Er,... good.
She hasn't uttered a word that whole time -- until she saw the big show.
Taransky isn't that good an actor. No, they're taking special precautions.  Some kind of new encryption.
You're in breach.
You'd cosmetically alter Simone to look like me?
Nothing bad can happen in a church, right?
I don't tell her a thing.
You have to add some twists and stuff. Maybe they run out of gas.
All the time. They're everywhere.  You won't tell anyone my secret, right?
You weren't a paper champion.
Yes! I think that's right!... I think they all want that. Even the scary ones...
So who moved it?
Tell you my secrets.
Chuck E. who?
J. C. Penny's?
Let's say today, we make it your business.
Oh yeah? Why's that?
Tramp.
Someone actually... employs you?
Yeah. It's the alternator all right.
How would you know? You're looking at my tits.  Jesus, Carl. Your job is to keep us on the road!
Sorry.
I'm serious. Get this. I had a careful look at that alternator. It's clearly been messed with... it's not wear and tear that caused that breakdown...
You're saying someone's trying to keep us on the farm...?
Not someone -- Mac.
Hell, no. But you missed a damn good sermon. "You can't hide a wicked heart from the eyes of the Lord."
Well, why don't you hold these as evidence in the meantime.
-- "Billy-Jean" --
I am not! I'm telling you, it's worth its weight in gold.
Metaphysical question, man.
Not while you're driving.
You don't like my costume? Cool. I'll go with plan B. Which one you like better?
The audience!
Buzzzzzzzzzz. Sorry, wrong answer!
Chicken sandwich?
Fuck you! Who cares what sandwich the bitch was eating?
Is that right?
Yeah, that's right! I'm outta here -- Y'all can kiss my city ass goodbye!... I'm gone with the wind.
Yeah?
When I was a kid... I was never allowed up here...
I... heard something... came in here last night. Must have gone to sleep.
You never had trouble communicating before.
I... saw him -- he tried to kill me -- he's, he's -- still -- out there --
HE'S STILL OUT THERE!!!
No --
You brought us here. And that morning I found you in the barn. You had scratches on your face --
You sabotaged the bus! You kept us here... To die! First Keith, then Carl --
Oh, yeah?
Why? Listen, it doesn't matter. I gotta go.
When you wanted to run away, I called your dad.
Shelby!
Do it.
Work thing hell, Starla. He just wants to get in your pussy. Him and most these other ones around here. That's where their minds is at, them sick fucks.
Wearing white, just like on our... wedding day. I remember it.
Not that I don't have any respect for the law, but what's your problem, man?
What's the matter? Legend has it Bandit LaRue's king of the road.
All sound reasons for matrimony.
Why? You have a bowling date?
Why are you doing this obviously macho feat?
No. I want to know what you think about besides ditching Smokey?
Seriously?!?
Would I lie to you?
What do you want to be when you grow up?
A Texas Bear in Arkansas.  Something's up and at this point in my life, I don't want to know what it is.
I don't know. We were planning on seeing the Astrodome.
You could've asked.
I guess if there's one lesson I've learned, it's that even misery has a tough time hitting a moving target.  I forgot your question?
That man is your father?!?
Wake up, man; I just got us a hot run for big bucks.
No one's ever done it before. This'll put us on the map.
Yeah, I can tell he's gonna be a major asset.
I don't know, man. Ask him?
Now, if I say go to channel three, it really means go to six.
That's 'cause we're damn near an hour ahead of schedule.
Save it. We got a long haul.
This is Bandit I, come back.
On its way. Give me a coupla minutes, okay?
You're gonna hit some heavy precipitation in about six minutes. Better let your flaps down, these roads are killers when they're damp.
Well, they're gonna. It's time this gearjammer rode to glory.  Now, move aside; good buddy. I'm coming through.
Go breaker.
Bandit, I just thought I'd lay a Smokey report on you.
What's your twenty and what's your handle?
Wonderful psychology. Why don't you say something about my mom?  Excuse me.
He's thirsty.
You're soundin' real bodacious. Back.
Then it must be a helluva idea.
Because I wanna see this hot shot Bandit do something that can't be done. Besides, there's nothing I like better than breaking legends.
That's the point, Dickey.
Now, you just find him, son.
That's correct.
What kind of personnel?
You have a butler working that floor?
Only the mention made in that phone call. There's no Swedish hitman of any renown, much less one with a million dollar day rate.
Well... This is as good a place for it as any I guess.
Tampering with a witness extraction of this magnitude makes everyone indictable at the federal level.  Trust me, we won't any problems with the hotel staff. You show 'em your ID with the letters "F.B.I." in all caps and it's instant compliance. I've seen in happen a hundred times.
Get a coroner's estimate too.  -- Miss, I've been transferred and I was disconnected. No one is answering and I need someone from security to pick up that line. It's urgent.
Three men were ambushed and shot, two died and had their bodies tossed into the lake, the other has severe hypothermia, possible dementia and will probably be a multiple amputee by week's end... if he even lives that long.
Then what --
I know you left him a message. What did you say!
Without peer?
Bullshit it is. I said, about as loud as I could say it, "no jail time for my guys."
I don't have to do shit! Which includes cooperating any further with these motherfuckers until I get what I want!  Alright, fuck it, if we gotta hand 'em somebody from our end and they're being hard-ons about it -- make it Hugo, him I don't mind. He needs that regimented thing that prison provides --
The Deputy Director, this prick Locke, he smashed the whole thing, we're done, they won't tell me why...
My debrief --
-- You can and you will.
Yeah, y'ain't heard the punchline, yet and before I get to it, one more thing I heard, little curious, should probably bring it up... Primo wants Israel's heart. The actual thing, the organ.
Yeah, there's a pair'a broads I'm thinking might be good for this.
That's not a problem. Are we goin' outta pocket ourselves?
How are we on time...?
Got hit twice.
He a dog babydoll. He a great dane. I tried to tell y'after ya'll first date. He hit that ass one time, his interest in a bitch start t'landslide.
Fuck you.
-- I thought we had secure frequency. Aww girl, tell me this mafucka ain't goin' off right now.
What else did Padiche say?
Where's his body?
Just so you know: I'm not going back until I understand what it is.  I am going to figure out what it is, make it stop, and then I will go home.
That's fantastic.
Not her.  It.
Why would you let her to do that?
Whose side are you on?
If it continues, it will implode from its own weight and turn into a black hole in about four hours and pulls us in with it.
In his lab.  He won't let you in.
I wish you'd told me.
-- we are not sure of that.  We are not sure we aren't all hallucinating.
Well, I think we're reaching the point of diminishing returns here, right?  Certainly it's learning more about us than we'll ever learn about it.
Perhaps it did.
No.
What plan?
Into what?
I won't be making the trip.
But I can't leave with you.  I won't make it.
To calm my anxiety.
Stop it.
I am.  Please come with me.  I don't want to do this here.
You're talking about a man in a white beard again.  You're ascribing human characteristics to something that isn't human.  Human beings look for causes and patterns.  How could we know what Solaris is up to, if anything?
When I saw you were gone I got scared.
I been thinking about how much I hate you.
Seven, eight.  So one day my mother catches me sort of staring off into space, and she asks me what I'm doing, and I start trying to explain to her, about this state that I can put myself in, and this look comes over her face.
What kind of look?
I did too.
Well.  He doesn't think it's God, but for different reasons than me. He's thinking: If I can figure out how to make it stop, than I am smarter than it is, and therefore it cannot be God.
Sartorius.
Why did she do it?
You... she said I didn't love her.
Was she right?
I'm just as human as you.  I see, I hear, I touch, and I feel just like you do.
That's what you were saying.  I heard what you were saying.
It's all right.
How can I tell?  You've seen both of me.  I only know what you're like here.  You're all I know.  There is no "You" from before.
Rheya --
I want you here.
That's impossible.  I'm not Rheya.
I wish you wouldn't.
It put you here.  I'll admit it, it acted like a God and put you here, put you into my consciousness.  I was asleep, and it put you into my dream.  I saw your mouth.  And there you were.  Whether you've been sent here to make me happy or punish me, it doesn't matter.  The decision we make now is all that matters.  Stay with me.
He won't.
Hello, Win.
You still writing the occasional magazine article?
Occasionally.
It's okay... I've never been a detective before either...
I have to pick something up before Bergdorf's closes, then stop at a reception just a few blocks away.
You wouldn't happen to know what language they speak in India, do you?
Urdu and Hindi.
Could be, I guess.
So it was "love".
Yeah.  It was.
Very nice.
Claire...!
I do care about you!
Are you okay?
Tomorrow night.  Can you come?
Do you dance?
Yeah...
It's Venza.  He wants you.  You, for Ellie and Tommy.
I think it's probably still a good idea.
Win made his choices, Claire.  We all do --
Too kinky.
What?
You don't want to hear about it.
She didn't like the other one, so she picked this one.
Why?
Take it easy!  I set her up.  I saw it coming.
You heard me.
What're you talking about --
Anyone who turns himself in makes a good case for bail.
It should've been me...
I can't do it, you know that... He's not gonna allow it anyway, Mike.  No way is he gonna let anybody walk out of that house alive, who can finger him.
Erect.  You know, a "boner?"  I'd heard that it gives you a boner, to shoot a man.
She's not a suspect, sir, she's a witness.  Could I ask you to step outside, please.
I'll bring her in.  You let them go, and I'll bring her in.
I'll take his place, all right?  Put the gun to my head.
Lay back, Mack.
She's what?
We're gonna pass the street.
Oh, beware of jealousy, my lord, the green-eyed monster...
Wasn't worth gettin' upset over a Milky Way.  Anyways, I was never much for, ya know, discipline.
A little bunny I saved from dissection.
Harry…
Mm-hmm.
Lemme down, bugface!
That's not even close.
You print pictures of Bigfoot!
You're making my life difficult.
Well...
I-- uh--
I hate your relatives, I hate your coffee, I hate your shoes.
Hurry up, Flash!
That wasn't clever.  That was just nasty.
I think I'd like that.
Just shut up and close your eyes. This'll hurt.
Her cleverness, that hard edge-- maybe they're the weakest part of her. The strong part is… what's underneath.  The part she was protecting.  There's no reason to protect it... I think she's just finding that out now.
I... I like you.  A lot.
Some of him… char-broiled bones. Teeth. We ruled out suicide.  Any bad blood between him and Ock?
There's an infinitely greater danger. If--  Listen.  The only thing Octavius cares about is repeating his experiment.  To do that, he needs a radioactive catalyst, SL 270.
You sure about all this?
No such thing as coincidence.  "God does not play dice with the universe."
Einstein, right?  We'll see ya.
See?  You big dullard.
Power down.  I need to talk to you.
Doubtless.  And you'll have all the time in the world to pursue your work.   Somewhere else.
No. It isn't.
Actually, I got this spider bite…
How much do you know about it?
I was hoping you'd call, babe. Look, you got representation?
Why? It is a wrestling match, or…
No.  No, I-- my aunt and uncle. Something's wrong  --  I need to make a phone call.
And blow up the universe just to prove he's right?  Bit egotistical, isn't it?
They never caught on.
They may. That's why I would keep my mouth shut.
We did not.
Don't worry. He'll be all right.
Looks good outside.
I don't know anymore.
How come the Krauts knew about that stove, Security? And the tunnel? How come you can't lay down a belch around here without them knowing it?
That's right.
You ain't going to squeal this one, brother.
We're looking at it.
Tipping me off? I do not understand.
You are talking crazy!
Yes, it would. Do we know each other?
You won't get off that cheap.
Let's!
I didn't do it -- I didn't do it.
Nine-thirty. General von Pfeffinger should be at his desk by now. Shall we call Berlin and tell him the good news?
I want to sleep... I haven't slept for three days.
Interesting.
Jawohl?
Hamburger and onions! Strawberry shortcake! Gefillte fish! Banana split! French fried potatoes! Chicken a la king!
Hey -- Comrade! Over here! This is Harry Shapiro -- the Volga Boatman of Barrack four!
So what? There's other women!
Blind? How stupid can you get, Animal? I drank the stuff myself.
Sugar-lips Shapiro! Frightening, ain't it?
Let me alone.
You don't want to cry over a dame that doesn't even know you're alive! Snap out of it!
This is me, Animal! It's Harry Shapiro!
Of course. I'm aware of the Geneva Convention. They will be given the burial they deserve. Or perhaps you would suggest we haul in twenty-one cannons from the Eastern Front and give them a twenty-one gun salute?
Just one question. Did you calculate the risk?
Says who?
You starting that again?
Uh-huh. Fell right on my head.  Sprechen sie deutsch?
Give this to Joey, will you?
I wasn't so sure. I just liked the odds.
I'll tell you how come.  The Barrack Chief gave them the green light. And you, our Security Officer, said it'd be safe. That's how come.
Yes, I'm from Cleveland.
Thirty-fifth.
Three hundred and sixty-fifth Bomb Squadron? Out of Chelveston?
A lot of people say that and the first thing you know is they get married and live happily ever after.  I wonder what they're trying to pull out there?
Suppose you let those mattresses cool off a little -- just out of decency?
Ich weiss alles.
Ganz einfach... Streichhoelzer... und eine Zigarette...
You should go and see the doctor. Maybe I can --  Silk stockings?
I do not want those cigarettes.
Yes, you do!
Maybe those Russian dames would take him.
Then when is he going to Engineering?
Can you project its course?
Yes, sir. There are two in the Veridian system.
Population?
That is true. However, I believe my growth as an artificial lifeform has reached an impasse. For thirty-four years I have endeavored to become more "human"- to grow beyond my original programming. And yet I am still unable to grasp such a simple concept as humor. This emotion chip is the only answer.
Really? What do you feel?
The Farpoint mission? Data, that was seven years ago.
You're in the Nexus.
When the Enterprise-B beamed us off the Lakul, we were partially in the Nexus. The transporters locked on to us, but somehow everyone left a part of themselves behind.
All of us.
Wherever he wanted to be.
Yeah. They're great, aren't they? You can go back and see them born, go forward and see your grandchildren. Time has no meaning here.
Yes, where would you go?
You're right. I'll need help.  Guinan, will you come back with me? Together, we could-
It's our pleasure.
Please, please.
I'm from what you would consider the future; the 24th-century.
Better?
She's not real either, is she? Nothing here is. Nothing here matters.
I hadn't planned on it.
That's right.
Least I could do for a captain of the Enterprise.
What do you mean, you're not going? We promised.
Hmm,  Inform Starfleet Command. This could indicate a new Romulan threat in this sector.
As ship's counselor, it's your duty to know not only when you're needed but also when you're not.
An experimental compound the Romulans have been working on. In theory, a trilithium-based explosive would be thousands of times more powerful than an anti-matter weapon. But they never found a way to stabilize it.
I do not see how. The plasma coil is part of their cloaking device.
I can't get an answer. Starfleet is up to its brass in galactic conference. No one has time for those who only stand... and wait.
Yes. He has a long journey ahead.
Sir. Commander, Starfleet on emergency channel. He orders you to surrender this vessel.
Sir, Starfleet calling Grissom again. A warning about us.
What did you see, Chekov?
For an instant... A scout class vessel.
Dr. Marcus, it's your planet.
It has to be. Gravitational fields were in flux... It must have soft landed...!
It's okay -- I should have known you'd come... Saavik's right: this planet is unstable. It's going to destroy itself in a matter of hours.
I'm sorry, sir. Just don't surrender. Genesis doesn't work! I can't believe they'll kill us for it --
Sector three... Sub-tropical vegetation... Temperature --  Temperature decreasing rapidly --
It's a little early to celebrate.
As before... Metallic mass... Verifying triminium photon tube... No new data.
You mean, we're stranded down here?!
Not exactly.
I don't understand.
No!... I'll do it.  Give me your phaser.
Scan for vessels in pursuit!
They've knocked out the damn automation center.  I've got no control over anything!
What? What are you saying?
What about Grissom, Mr. Chekov?
... A cloaking device?
Approach control... this is Enterprise. Ready for docking maneuver.
Yes, Admiral. Step into my parlor.
But, we had requested -- we were hoping to take her back to Genesis...
If we don't help each other, we'll all die here!
Yes, I was...
Then you must know that you should have come with him to Vulcan.
Sir. Your son meant more to me than you can know. I'd have given my life if it would have saved his. You must believe me when I tell you that he made no request of me!
You must bring them to Mount Selaya -- on Vulcan. Only there is the passage possible. Only there can both find peace...
What you ask is difficult.
They outnumber us, my Lord --
I underestimated him... He did the one thing I didn't anticipate ... He destroyed himself...
All true.
Would you like to tell me whose are the <u>right</u> hands, my cold-blooded friend? Are you in favor of these experiments?
Uh -- what are they?
And who am I hiding from?
Something Spock was trying to tell me. On my birthday.
But we can't just sit here -- !
I can hardly see --
Umm. And would Admiral Kirk have access to such information?
I see. Helmsman?
I am truly sorry.
Is that what you came here to say?
Mainly.  And also that I'm proud -- very proud -- to be your son.
<u>Where's the over-ride</u>??
... to prevent an enemy from doing just what we're attempting; using <u>our</u> console to tap in a message, an order to lower Reliant's damn shields...
KHAN!
Listen to me -- you men and women --
I've never even met Admiral Kirk --
All is well, sir. You have the coordinates to beam up Genesis...
I'm going down to the station.
Uhura, send to Commander, Reliant: prepare to be boarded.
Picture, Mr. Saavik.
He'll die -- !
Oh, no, sir! This is the finest engine room in the whole Star --
I am understandably curious.
It had the virtue of never having been tried.
Than you. Yes, I see that. By the way, thank you for this.
The Enterprise. I must check in before your inspection. And you?
To be sure, Captain.
Or the one.
Have they proceeded with their experiments?
The tape was made a year ago. I can only assume they've reached Phase Two by now --
It would explain a great many things --
Transmission jammed at the source, sir.
Uhura, if you don't hear from us, there won't be anybody behind. Kirk out.  You gentleman can remain here, or...
Very well.
And why not?
Lieutenant, self-expression does not seem to be one of your problems.
HURRY.
Stage Two of what?
Two minutes, ten seconds.
I cut your new orders personally. By the end of the month, you'll have your first command: USS EXCELSIOR.
Battle stations.
Aye, Captain.
What did you expect, Lieutenant?
I would accept that as an axiom.
Just a couple of kooks...
Yeah.
And finally, they're not human beings, you know. Their intelligence has in no way been proven comparable to ours --
I tried to clear things up, Professor Scott. I explained you'd come all the way from Edinburgh on appointment to study manufacturing methods here at Plexico, but they don't seem to know anything about it.
Indeed... May I offer you gentlemen anything?
No way -- somebody has to keep an eye on him!
Spock, start your computations for time warp.  Come on, Bones. Let's pay Scotty a visit.
Pavel, can you hear me? Give me your name and rank...
Spock, it's me, Bones! I mean our experience was unique. You really have gone where no man has gone before. Can't you tell me what it felt like?
A joke is a story with a humorous climax.
Hamlet, Act I scene 4.
Guess, Spock. Your best guess.
I suppose they told you that...?
You're not one of those guys from the military, are you? Trying to teach whales to retrieve torpedoes, or some dipshit stuff like that?
Well, for one thing, we simply don't have the money to keep feeding them a couple of tons of shrimp a day!
Iowa.
Can I ask <u>you</u> something?
What's going to happen when you release the whales?
Very likely. You're not exactly catching us at our best.
You? You can't even get from Sausalito to San Francisco without a lift.
It's not so much a matter of a place as of time.
Who do you think I am?
I'm all ears.
Noon tomorrow...?!
Lemme tell you something. I'm here to bring two humpbacks into the 23rd Century. If I have to, I'll go to the open sea to get them, but I'd just as soon take yours -- better for me, better for you... and better for them.
A spaceship with a missing man.
Thank you. For everything.  Beam me up, Scotty.
You need me.
I belong here.  Suppose by some miracle you do get them through.  Who in the 23rd Century knows anything about Humpback whales?
It would be improper to refer to you as Jim while you are in command, Admiral... Also, I must apologize for my attire.  I seem to have misplaced my uniform.
What are the variables...?
Explain.
... Simple logic.
Ah... The giants.
Well, for one thing, you haven't quite got the hang of it.
That's cutting it closer than you know. What about team two?
Then... Where the hell are we?
What is our condition?
Aye, sir!
Overlapping distress calls. Some from Starships... others...
Sir... Estimating one nautical mile.
I'll try, sir. Scott out.  Well now, he's got himself in a bit of a snit, don't he.
Don't take too long. We're sitting ducks for their radar systems...  Mr. Sulu, impulse climb.
It's under water! There's no way to reach it...
That's easy: 6 inches. We carry stuff that big in stock.
Hi. Huey 205, isn't it?
All right, then this is old stuff to you.
Yes, of course... Do you have any message for your mother?
Gomen nasarei. Hito chigai de gozaranuka na.  I'm sorry, my son. You have mis- taken me for someone else.
In defense of offlanders, there are many more like me...
An apprentice for thirty years.  We've noticed your people's mental discipline. Did that develop here?
More questions. Always the explorer. If you stay long enough, that'll change.
I am better.
I don't.
Really?
My legs are eighty-seven-point- two centimeters. They were eighty-seven-point-two centimeters the day I was created. They will be eighty- seven-point-two centimeters the day I go off line. My operation depends on specifications that do not change.  I... cannot imagine... the experience of growing up or even tripping over my own feet...
Because you're it. And if you tag me... then I'm it.
No... I want to stay with you...
Data doesn't breathe.
Not at all. They're fine... in fact, they're better than fine. Increased metabolism, high energy, improved muscle tone. We should all be so lucky.
Very good, Doctor. Picard out.
Yes. But look at this medscan...
Captain, Geordi...?
It's nothing personal data. You have to remember these people have rejected technology. And you...
And I do not believe I made a very good first impression.
I prefer to wait until we can share the benefits with all the people of the Federation...
I know what Data means to Starfleet, Jean-Luc... but our crew is at the mercy of those people on the planet...
We haven't fully identified the anomalies yet. They're calling this whole area The Briar Patch... it took us a day to reach a location where we could get a signal out to you. Just get me Data's schematics. I'll keep you informed.  Dougherty out.
That's why we put chromodynamic shields in place - so our people wouldn't feel the effects from the metaphasic radiation...
I'm acting on orders form the Federation Council.
Our best scientific minds already have. We can't find any other way to do this.
But I would need at least three minutes on the bridge.
It's our only way out of here, Mister Nara.
Cometary debris, pockets of unstable metreon gas... we don't want to go in there, sir...
Top level review, my ass. There'll be no cover-up of this. Not after I get...
Ask them.
We'll skip the court martial this time... Picard out.
Sir?
Make it so.
Beam him out!
No, sir. I haven't had a chance to meet all the new crew members since I've been back...
Wine, women and song.
Hmm, I should feel right at home with them...
I've stabilized him for now... but he's in a coma and he's going to need radiometric therapy. I want to take him to the ship.
That'll be interesting.
If they're not... we'd better get used to living in Montana.
It is impossible to imagine sensations for which I have no frame of reference.
I wish to... go back to the way I was.
Then take the final step... give me the Enterprise... and we can be together... always.
I believe so.
Power. There hasn't been a lot of wind through here for the last couple of weeks. Most of the batteries are depleted.
I'm having trouble scanning underground. There's a lot of radiation leaking from something.
Then we'll just have to assume it's still there...
Active.
Huh.
I'm an old friend of Cochrane's... I wanted to see how he was doing.
Wrong answer, Mister Picard. Try again.
Thank God this plate was already fixed.
You're lying.
All right. Truth. I believe that one. Why is it so urgent you couldn't wait until morning?
I am not a thief...
Where? And don't tell me San Francisco...
This may be hard for you to understand... but I'm duty-bound not to interfere with you, or anyone else here... any more than is absolutely necessary.
Data, set a course for that vortex.
We're still in Earth orbit.
Incoming message from the Starship Intrepid. Admiral Hayes.
Agreed. Options?
Try not to look at the stars... keep your eyes on the ship.
We've lost Bridge control!
We just lost main power... and we've got Class-Three alerts all over the ship. I'm not sure what's --
Mister Worf... find Data if you can, but your top priority is isolating the Borg.
What are you suggesting?
Captain, I've scanned the planet. The atmosphere contains a high concentration of methane, carbon monoxide and fluorine. The oceans have been chemically altered, as well.
Once we're beyond the shield they should be able to pick it up two sectors away.
Spock's looking for us...
I thought I would assume a pleasing shape.  We're outside the shield. Now it's your turn, Kirk.
You feign ignorance?
Yes.
For insubordination.
But if she's cloaked...
Shields up, Captain --?
Is that wise, sir? I mean, given their situation -  Aye, sir.
And your coat.
There's a reward for your death.
Getting outside the shield is easy. After that it's up to you to get us off the surface before we freeze. Can you?
Thank you. Lieutenant, one quarter impulse power...
Kronos, sir?
We're almost at the rendezvous - I thought you'd want to know...
Right -
You piloted well out of spacedock, Lieutenant -
When does this conference start?
Far be it for me to dispute my first officer. Starfleet has always -
From Enterprise?
The night is young. Anyway, it was logical.  You know, you're a great one for logic. I'm a great one for  rushing in where angels fear to tread. We're both extremists. Reality is probably somewhere in between us.
Spock, you want to know something?
I'm going aboard. Spock, you have the conn.
Who else?
I am not certain such speculations are included among your duties, Lieutenant.
What do you suggest, Lieutenant? Opening fire won't retrieve the Captain; and an armed engagement was precisely what he wished to avoid.
Curious. You haven't been assisting Commander Uhura with her radio transmissions, have you, Lt?
Very well. For twenty-four hours we'll agree that this conversation did not take place.
What is it?
I've already addressed that question, Mr. Scott. We'll e able to follow the Captain's movements.
We'll have to check every one of them, Mr. Scott.
Not from us!
If another ship had been beneath us the Klingons would've seen her!
Even assuming you're correct, Mr. Spock, why would they fire on their own President?
Well, what about all that atmospheric equipment we're carrying to catalogue gaseous anomalies?
I was taken from my homeworld by people called the "PakJeds." They are fat. They traded me to a ship belonging to the "Bolians." The "Bolians" are blue. They put me in a seat and asked me questions. Then they were attacked by another ship...
I am in a room with lights.
Is that your final answer?
Aye, sir... This way.
While I find that fascinating, Data, we really need that Goddamned door open!
I thought only me, myself and Lore.
The resemblance is... striking.
Thank you.
The least I could do for you, Deanna.  Besides, you know me... I’m a talking head.
Of course, sit down.
The B-9 is like a slow child, sir. And Data, in his own way, has assumed the position of a parent or guardian. I'm afraid he has expectations based on his own experiences. He'll be disappointed when the BI-9 cannot meet those expectations.
The one thing he may have forgotten in the course of battle: me.
This isn't about me anymore.
This isn't real.
I can feel your desire, Deanna.
What do we know about the population?
What if we target all phasers in a concentrated attack?
Captain!
Who was it?
Aye, sir
Sir --
Acknowledged ...  ...I'll talk to Data.
A coup d'etat?
The Praetor's power has always been the Romulan fleet. They must be behind him.
Away team. Transporter room four.
Agreed.
When your first officer insists that you can't go on away missions... Ignore him.
No?
Not quite. I envy the hair- line.
Yes. The eyes have it.
Our eyes reflect our lives, don't they? Yours are so confident.
And you dreamed about what was up there. About...
I'm honored to think I might someday speak with such eloquence.
I need a sample of your blood. What do your Borg friends say? Resistance is futile. 
We are.
And what of the Enterprise?
Look at me, Shinzon! Do you feel the blood pumping inside you? Your hands, your eyes, your nature, are the same as mine. Buried deep inside you beneath the years of pain and anger is a capacity you've forgotten. It's the one way our mirror can reflect the two of us exactly because it's the very thing that truly defines us. To be human is to try to make yourself better than you are.
Not so long.
Our greater goal is more important, brother.
Let's go.
Find her again.
And when I return... you and I shall have a little talk about showing proper respect!
There is. They came out of the belly of the ship and then went to the first terrace and flew down into the houses.
No, we can handle this.
I'll take that.
We should have. Let me see.
I understand.
Hey, that sounds interesting. You like it?
No.
And don't be shy about your English. You speak better than a lot of people I know.  Take care of yourself.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
What was your last stop?
Houston found it in the extraterrestrial's suit.
We'll get those answers when you find the one you're looking for.
You have to. We're trying to contact the ship. If we do, I'll let you know immediately. Good luck.
When can we expect containment?
It's messy... the thing's got a gun... We're just asking for somebody to get killed...
You'll get results one way or the other, that's for sure... Okay.
I'm gonna be here if you need anything.
We don't have to do it that way. We can catch him this time.
Gear shift.
That way.
Flashlight.
Pancakes.
No gas.
Closed?
I am Jenny Haydn.
Jennyhaydn.
I am...
Up there... I... eh... can't explain...  But that's the only place you could be from.
I know.
My... husband.
No, no... don't say that. Bad word.
You want to try it?
This stuff could kill...  Be my guest.
That's not much time. I'll just slow you down. I have to sleep. I'm very tired. And I have to wash and eat. You don't...
No.
Then let me go. You don't need me.
Eh... yes...
Why?
Then don't be smart.
Can I have the gun?
Yes.
Yes?
I don't understand 'friend.'
I understand.
I've noticed... Do you understand what they're saying?
This car will take me to Las Vegas. I cannot go back.
Let's find a place out of the rain. I'm sure we'll get a ride in the morning.
No, they don't talk... We talk to them.
I understand.  Thank you.
You won ten dollars. Big deal. If we don't get a good ride before dark we could miss your ship.
Yes.
You want the baby to laugh at me.
Goodbye.
Would be kinda neat if they were. I think I could outrun them. Maybe get my picture in the papers.
Any reports about monsters, people in Halloween masks, anything like that?
Did your people have any contingencies rehearsed?
We're ready.
Save us all a lot of trouble.
You have no conception of this, do you?
Any signs of biological contamination, excessive radiation, anything like that?
Listen to this.  A woman was kidnapped in Eau Claire this morning. When a citizen went to her rescue the kidnapper threatened him with a gun and shouted at him in a strange 'clicking gibberish'...
The police think he was high on drugs...
I know what I saw. I've seen him enough times.
Hey... he didn't look like no big time criminal to me.
That's what I thought. So remember it was me because sometimes rewards come late, you know.
Joey, make sure Mr. Nero gets safely to his car.
You're going down.
Uh huh.  And I said, 'That's good, because I like the feeling of someone watching me.  I acquired the taste from Lenny.'
Yeah, OK, whatever you say.  Just answer one question.  Is anything wrong?  Iris said you might be in trouble.
That's a good one, coming from you.
Come on, Faith!  He's just toying with you.  And when he gets bored, you'll be yesterday's papers.
No.  Mace is in this.
Clips.
I can get you what you want.  You just have to talk to me.  I'm your priest, your shrink, your main connection to the switchboard of souls.  I'm the Magic Man, the Santa Claus of the Subconscious.  You say it, you even think it, you can have it.  You want a girl, you want two girls?  I don't know what your thing is or what you're curious about... you want a guy?  You want to be a girl... see what that feels like? You want a nun to tie you up?  It's all doable.
He stalks her.  He rapes her.  Then he does her...
Yup.  Hey, so I heard you dropped in on Tran last night.  Another slick Lenny move.
Is he dead?
No.  But his frontal lobes are like two runny eggs.  They put an amplifier in-line to boost the signal till it french-fried his brain.
You know, statistically that's the second most common word people say right before they die.  Shit being number one.
You got froggy on me a couple times.
Yeah.  Pretty zany, huh?  All this shit caused by a random traffic stop.  Hey... nothing means nothing. You know that.  Look around... the whole planet's in total chaos.  You gotta take what you can, while you can.  Cause some shitbird can come up and put a fuckin' .22 in the back a your head any second.
I got ways, Lenny, I got ways.  Okay, okay... I got a deal with some a the paramedics.  My guy pages me and I pick it up at the morgue.  So whaddya think?  This clip's gotta be worth at least a grand.  Right?
I was invited here by a close friend, Mr. Fumitsu, see he's right over there.
They jerked my wheels, d'you believe it?  I mean it's outrageous, the computer errors the banks are making lately.  Have you noticed?
Lenny, this may be a hard concept for you, but friends don't have to pay their friends.
Yeah, but that was for love.
Get it.
Macey, I know you're tired, but can you drop me at the Retinal Fetish? It's on your way.
She wanted to go out to my car, something about my car...
Something in your car...
It's in my case.  Okay?  I'm going to open my case...
Lenny.  Calm down.  This is what I do.
You sure?
Mace.  I know what you think about the wire.  But I'm asking you to do this.  It's that important.
People finding out... seeing... that the LAPD just flat out executed Jeriko One.  Jesus.  Maybe they ought to see.
Yeah.  You gave up your hot tub tape to save me.  That's real progress for you.
Why?
Deputy Commissioner Palmer Strickland.  The sanctimonious prick who busted me out.  His ass is so tight when he farts only dogs can hear it.  I know this guy.  If there's one cop who's not dirty it's him.
Uh unh.
Are you going to make me beg?
Um... he was older.
Besides that.
Before your time. It was Richard Low's brainchild, or, lack-of-brain child. The Behavioral Sciences Unit at Quantico is essentially the product of three men: David Koessler, Dick Low and myself. Low was a field agent, Koessler administrative, I was teaching criminology. Low came up with the concept of a serial killer's signature. He invented profiling. Everything we know about profiling started with Richard Low...
Pacific Northwest is a hotbed for serials.
I'm babysitting the DEA guys this afternoon, Casio and I. You said that was top priority.
Just mopping up. Nine bodies in all.
That's right, Jan.
Sheriff Dylan, this is FBI Agent Thomas Mackelway. Remember me?
I want to talk about the Karen Sumpter case.
We had to bring staff in from the whole county to handle this.
Mam, it's my truck. I know my own capacity.
You must get lonely. You ever think about, you know... 
Excuse me?
It's been wiped down a hundred times since then.
I had gotten their trust. We were sharing fantasies. I couldn't risk it.
You refused to comply with a direct order.
I was lucky to find, much less crack, the address code -- no way to be sure I could have done it again.
He got away. I had him. He got away.
Mack the Mouth at a loss for words.
That gasbag. I can imagine what he said. I'm not ashamed to admit that most of what I know about criminal profiling started with Richard Low. I have also, over the years, I admit, taken credit for many of his accomplishments. He was the most brilliant law enforcement individual I ever met.
We had every reason to believe he was on that plane. He was supposed to be on the plane. Everything was incinerated, it was two weeks before we reached the crash site. We, the Director and I, decided it was in everyone's best interest to declare Dick Low dead. That way he could exit a hero.
Both in the last year. I suspected only someone as brilliant as Dick Low could find these guys.  Look, whatever Daitz told you, nobody wanted to strip Richard of his badge. You have to get close to be good at what he did, the trick is not to get too close.
Collected shoes too?
In Ft. Myers before your instruction. Nowhere else, sir.
None taken.
That's part of the reason I dropped by. I need to learn this stuff.
Taking a Stryker saw, cutting off the top of someone's cranium, pulling the brain out -- what's that, a day in Spring?
You got a point there.
He thinks he looks young.
What's this country coming to?
You must really think I'm a square, a computer nerd.
No, Mack, I do not think you're a square and definitely not a nerd.
I know.
I've been thinking about this.
Not yet. Not about this, either.
Not the way I can.
I just need to go a little slow.
Where are you? Everybody's looking for you.
Start killing people for real?
I guess I'm a little paranoid.
And you're working with him?
Does one exist?
You're assigned, we're assigned, to apprehend Richard Low, not Suspect Zero. I have to tell you, Mack, I'm not comfortable where you're going.
But it was your idea: "use Zero," you said, use Zero to get Low.
It's a truck. A refrigerated truck.
Turn around. Stretch your arms over the seat.
I'll give you a little hint. You're a smart guy, figure it out.
Yes.
Daitz hinted it existed. It was a matter of forming the request in the proper terms.
It was the mall.
Maybe you should back off.
[Follow me.]
Thomas Mackelway.
This is a first. You criticized the Deputy Director to his face and you still have a badge? You must have some one-of-a-kind skills.  Why don't you just quit? I mean, you're not going to get promoted, not wearing this jacket.
Koessler?
350 miles.
Now, Mr. Hawkins, when last in Amarillo, where did you get gas?
You're right. I know.
I don't know about that.
Okay. I'll think about that. Bye.
Are you calling Her?
You're money, baby.
...maybe...
You're a comedian?
Yeah.
I'm Mike.
No... Maybe that's not the case. Maybe she shouldn't be such a smug little shit because she'd be surprised at what a good dancer he really is, but it's been a long time and he doesn't know if he's ready to...
Mike...
You haven't told then, huh?
Wait... Wait... Listen... So, I check the time and place. I'm where I'm supposed to be. I call my agent... She says they asked for me specifically...
I'm a "Dorothy".
Did you get it?
I believe it too. He really just wants her to be happy.
Could you believe it?
Wait here, I'll get you that martini.
Sure, that'll be fine.
Six years.
Me too.
It's not going to well?
Neither is acting. Not if you're serious about it.  Can I have one of these?
Why, you like the duck with the cigar? 
...home. It's getting late. Yeah.
...Which one...?
How are you doing?
Fine... I guess. You?
Really?
No, he's not... Listen I don't want to talk about him. That's a whole other headache. I called because I heard you might be moving back to Queens...
I really want to catch up with you, but I've gotta take this call. They're holding. I'll talk with you when you get back in town. Bye.
So the only difference is if I forget about her or pretend to forget about her.
Well that sucks.
I mean first you'll pretend not to care, not call -- whatever, and then, eventually, you really won't care.
Ah, see, that's the thing. Somehow they don't come back until you really don't care anymore.
Thanks, man. Sorry we always talk about the same thing all the time...
Hey man, don't sweat it.
Do you realize how hard it's going to be to tell my parents? I still haven't told them I didn't get the pilot.
I don't know. It's like not talking to a pitcher in the midst of a no hitter.
Kinda.
I didn't mention her once today.
What'd you get?
Oh.  Where is this place?
There's the rub.
..."A Boy Named Sue". I think that's why he's such a bad cat.
Rejected?
Hey, man, you're not from here. You don't know how it is. I grew up in L.A...
...It was six months, and she didn't dump...
We ran into them that night at Roscoe's. Tee cleared it up, I apologized, bought them some chicken and waffles. They fuckin love Tee. That boy can talk.
Hi, Nikki. This is Mike. I met you tonight at the Dresden. I, uh, just called to say I, uh, I'm really glad we met and you should give me a call. So call me tomorrow, or, like, in two days, whatever. My number is 213- 555-4679... 
213-555-4679. That's all. I just wanted to leave my number. I don't want you to think I'm weird, or desperate or something...  ...I mean, you know, we should just hang out. That's it. No expectations. Just, you know, hang out. Bye. 
What Vegas?
Tonight, baby.
I know. Daddy's gonna get the Rainman suite. Vegas, baby. We're going to Vegas!
This is fuckin' post-pubescent Disneyland.
First let's see what happens if we play it cool.
Don't make fun, I think we can get some free shit if we don't fuck around.
Double down, baby. You gotta double down on an eleven.
I know, but...
If we don't look like we know what we're doing, then we may as well...
I don't know, what? Thirty, Forty maybe.
Let's just leave.
Baby, you're money. You're the big winner.
What an asshole.
I'm too tired for this. Let's just go.
Whatever. We'll see. Daddy's gonna get her to bring a friend. We'll both get one. I don't care if I'm with her or one of her beautiful baby friends.
That's bullshit.
It's just that I've been out of the game so long. Trent, I was with her for six years. That's before AIDS. I'm scared. I don't know how to talk to them, I don't know...
...gotta...
"Age of Enlightenment". Shit. Like some waitress in a Las Vegas coffee shop is going to get an obscure French philosophical reference. How demeaning. I may as well have just said "Let me jump your ignorant bones."...
...Baby...
Don't worry about me, baby. I just wanted you to have a good time.
She was hot.
Baby, you're so money you don't even know it.
Yeah.
It's on.
Don't sweat it, baby. This one's a lay-up.
I don't know. It was kind of a dick move if you ask me.
Yeah. I guess you could call it that.
They're a finesse team...
...It's on.
No! She's not looking at you. She hasn't looked at you once. Will you stop asking if... Wait, she just looked.
...double diamond...
...Yeah. But two's enough not to look anxious...
...Whatever. Things are different here. It's not like New York, Mikey.
...Shut up, Sue...
You don't have to wait three days...
Our little baby's growing up...
Yes. 
I ask for Justice.
I'll come to you when I need you.
Maybe three, four times.  I always asked Freddie if he wanted another bodyguard, but he said no.  Things have been so smooth the last ten years...
Go get Paulie, I don't care how sick he is.  Pick him up yourself, and bring him to my father's house.
You're on, kid...I'll square it with Mom your not seeing her before you left.  And I'll get a message to your girl friend when I think the time is right.
Then in a six month time we're on our own; is that it?
The Tattaglias will guarantee your investment also.
When did he call?
On a day like this.  Consiglero, do you also have in your notes the the Turk made his living from Prostitution before the war, like the Tattaglias do now.  Write that down before you forget it.  The Turk will wait.
I didn't tell Mama anything.  I was about to come up and wake you and tell you.  Just now.
Tattaglia is a pimp.  He could never have outfought Santino.  But I wasn't sure until this day.  No, it was Barzini all along.
For killing a man.
I'm going to finish school.
I'll need him.
Michael, why must you do this.  We have been lucky so far, all these months you've been here we've kept your name a secret.  It is from love for your father that I've asked you never to more than an hour from the Villa.
I was told that my Grandfather was murdered on its main street; and his murderers came to kill my father there when he was twelve years old.
This one could seduce the devil.  A body! and eyes as big and black as olives.
Beautiful all over, eh?
I was as good a son to him as you or Mike.
OK, we sit tight until the old man can give us the lead.  But Tom, I want you to stay inside the Mall. You too, Mike, no chances.  Tessio, you hold your people in reserve, but have them nosing around the city.  The hospital is yours; I want it tight, fool-proof, 24 hours a day.
McCluskey can't stay with the Turk forever.  We'll wait.
Can you do it Mike?
Good...then you can go...  I don't like violence.  I'm a businessman, and blood is a big expense.
Not so perfectly if you noticed.
You really want to know?
Yes.  Tell me.
Al Capone!
Michael you're trying to scare me...
...who out of sheer terror had swallowed the bath towel in his mouth and suffocated.
Hello...this is Long Distance.  I have a call from New Hampshire.  Mr. Michael Corleone.  One moment please.
No, I would not like you better if you were Ingrid Bergman.
Goodbye.
You and I are going to move my father right now...to another room on another floor...Can you disconnect those tubes so we can wheel the bed out?
Absolutely not!  We have to get permission from the Doctor.
Jesus Christ, he's my father, Sonny.
The kid's right.
Yes, I promise.
I do renounce them.
Just be patient.
He talked to you?
Right.  Don't say my name, just listen.  Somebody shot your father outside his place fifteen minutes ago.
Is he alive?
I think so, but I can't get close enough.  There's a lot of blood. I'll try to find out more.
Is that good?
Everybody should have one talent.  What's yours?
Okay, darling.
It's always the same whenever someone new comes into his life -- Freddie, Fausto, Peter Smith-Kingsley -- he's wonderful -- did you meet him, he's a musician? -- ...and especially you, of course... and that's only the boys.
Okay.  And did we know each other?
Well, I knew you, so I suppose you must have known me.
Ripley. Hullo. How do you do.
What? What's this?
No, I think your mother, her illness --
I can't write and I can't spell. That's the privilege of a first-class education. You're upstairs at the back. I think Ermelinda made the bed up.
Sure. I love Venice.
And Rome.
Do you ski?  Don't tell me -- you're a lost cause! That's the next thing to deal with. We're planning to go to Cortina at Christmas. Excellent skiing. Excellent.  Marge -- Ripley can't ski. We'll have to teach him that, too. Have you ever known such low class?
It must be a deep secret, cause I don't know about it.
Well we certainly know that's true.
I didn't mean with you in it.
Freddie's arranged it with some of the skiing crowd. Come if you want but I thought you wanted to see the Forum...?
Get undressed in your own room, would you?
I thought you'd missed the train.
I thought you might write again. Now that we're brothers...
I can't, how can I, in all decency? We've had a good run, haven't we?
Ripley's plans.
Oh God, I don't think so.
Yesterday you're ogling girls on the terrace, today you're getting married. It's absurd.
You can be a leech -- you know this -- and it's boring. You can be quite boring.
What? I think I'm saying it. Something's going on. He's either converted to Christianity -- or to something else.
Marge, good morning. Unusual weather.
Well, if we all pushed him away what about him pushing us away? You've been a great friend to my son. Everything is someone else's fault. We all want to sow wild oars. Somebody's got to -- what's the word?  The moment someone confronts him he lashes out. He lashes out. You know, people always say you can't choose your parents, but you can't choose your children.
Thanks, yes, I think we did.
I hope she never knows.
Bird. That's jazz.
It's superb.
Didn't Dick say? -- He talked to Freddie... apparently it's not going to work out --  Freddie says there aren't enough rooms.
I tried again, waiting here, watching for him. Instead it's you. Whenever I look for Dickie I find you.  What happened to your face?
Perhaps I shouldn't go either.
He's American. He's already discovered Dickie cashed checks for $1000 the day before he disappeared.
Marge, I'm in the bath. Won't be long.
Why do I think there's never been a Ripley rainy day?
I know it was you -- I know it was you, Tom. I know it was you. I know you killed Dickie. I know it was you.
Oh Marge.
The funny thing is, I'm not Randall either. I'm Logue.
Right.
Is Freddie in Rome?
I've never admitted that to anyone.
You're crazy! It's freezing out there.
Otherwise you'd be fighting me off.
Hardly. I couldn't be less alone.
I've thought about you.
He's taken over the case because... they're annoyed the previous chap let Dickie... disappear when he was the only, he was the only suspect in Freddie's murder.
A ragione. A ragione. 
Well hurry, before we sink.  Should I give you my telephone number in Venice?
Ten thirty?
Hi.  Sorry. You okay? You look as if you've seen a ghost...
What do you mean? They're sending someone from Rome?
A Roma, circa tre settimane fa.
Then you meet someone special and all you want to do is toss them the key, say open up, step inside, but you can't because it's dark and there are demons and if anybody saw how ugly it was...
Plans -- good, plans for tonight or plans for the future?
Was that Meredith?
Never. We've had many requests and, of course, we say no -- even to your fiancée.
That's an expensive gun.
I want a .32. Revolver. And a palm gun. That .22 there.
The .32's $150 -- and you're really getting a good deal now -- and all together it comes to, ah, seven eighty- five for four pieces and a holster. Hell, I'll give you the holster, we'll make it seventy-five and you've got a deal -- a good one.
You can't carry in a cab even with a permit -- so why bother?
Vietnam? I saw it on your jacket. Where were you? Bet you got to handle a lot of weapons out there.
All right.  All right. I'm taking a break at four o'clock. If you're here then we'll go to the corner and have some coffee and pie.
My name is Travis.
Really?
Huh?
You mean you work seventy-two hours a week.
You know what you remind me of?
I don't follow music much. I'd like to though.  Honest.
No.  I thought maybe you could play it for me on your player.
No, these are the kind that couples go to. They're not like the other movies. All kinds of couples go. Honest. I've seen them.
Ah, yes, the guy at the newsstand, Mr. Asbestos...
Awh, come off it, Pal.
Support my kids. Can you dig it?  Nice to meet ya, Travis. So long, Wizard. Say hello to Malcolm X for me. 
That's the guy. Eddie calls him up and says, "Hey, what do you want me to do. I'm over here at Poly Prep. I got a girl in the back and she doesn't have the fare. She wants me to come in back and collect. What should I do?
No, just some crazy fucker. Cut half his ear off.
It's your time mister. Fifteen minutes ain't long.  That cigarette burns out, your time is up.
I drive a taxi. You tried to get away one night. Remember?
It don't matter. I'm gonna get you outta here. 
We better make it, or Sport'll get mad. How do you want to make it?
You can do it in my mouth.
I think so. I tried to get into your cab one night, and now you want to come and take me away.
Don't you want to go?
No, I mean really. This is nothing for a person to do.
Sure. All right. We'll have breakfast. I get up about one o'clock. Tomorrow.
O.K. It's a date. I'll see you here, then.
At least I don't walk the streets like a skunk pussy. I don't screw and fuck with killers and junkies.
Me? I could never go to a place like that.
Why?
You a narc?
Do I look like a narc?
Well, Iris, I look at it this way. A lot of girls come into my cab, some of them very beautiful. And I figure all day long men have been after them: trying to touch them, talk to them, ask them out. And they hate it. So I figure the best I can do for them is not bother them at all. So I don't say a thing. I pretend I'm not even there. I figure they'll understand that and appreciate me for it.
The Empire State in fog means something, don't it? Do you know, or don't you? What is your number, cabbie?
Well, you should know, damn it, or who else would know? Pull over right here.  Why don't you stick your goddamn head out of the goddamn window once in a while and find out about the goddamn fog!
Yes I am.
Got your license?
Clean. Real clean.  As clean as my conscience.
Twenty-six.
No, I want long shifts.
Hey Wizard.
Well, I just, you know...
Yeah. Sorry, Wizard.
Okay.  How 'bout Carla Goodspeed?  Six years, Bill.  We've lived together six years.
What do you have, a FUCKING WATER PISTOL?  Get him back!
I wish you were coming with me.
You mean,  me?
Go on home, folks.  And thanks for the welcome.
No, you are.  I know exactly what you mean.  It's not that you're missing something.  It's that the other person gives something to you... that you had all the time. You just didn't see it until they came along.
Eventually.  We were going to be  engaged... when you came back from  overseas...
Well, there's got to be a way...
Oh.  Okay.
Guess I must've learned.
Luke Trumbo?  We never met.  But I'd like to think I know him.
Is that because you were masquerading as Luke Trumbo while you were in Lawson?
Yes sir.  But I didn't go to Lawson to run The Bijou, that was... that was something that just happened. You see, I was involved in an accident in Lawson, and I spent some time recovering there.
We see it.  For the record, it reads "Lucille Angstrom."  What's the point of this?
Are you asking this committee to believe that you attended a meeting of a communist party front organization in order to impress a girl?
Well, this place sorta reminds me of something.
"It's a Wonderful Life."
And I hear you and Harry are planning on re-opening the Bijou.
Ah.
Who... are they?
Six-thirty.  I thought we'd get an early start.
... Ernie.
Between a new screen, paint, plumbing for the concession stand, and about a hundred other repairs around the theater... it's going to cost at least nine hundred dollars to get the Bijou into shape to open up.
Well, son, I wish I could've shown you more, but this is all that's left.  Just this one reel that never got sent back from a picture we showed here a long time ago. Nineteen twenty-five, to be exact...
Ha!
The film broke...
Don't tell me, I know about these things.  I've seen it before.  It's all right.  It's... all right. You're here.  Oh, God, I love you, son.
What.
You should watch what you say.  You don't know who's listening.
I'll save you the trouble.  I'm a cab.  There.  Did it myself.
Call me... Ishmael?
Aren't you coming?
What's his rent?
You can't testify.
Exactly.
Oh, I see.  But you're not Luke. You're Peter Appleton, the picture writer.
What, all of a sudden, "Lucille Angstrom" isn't a name?
Well, that's not what they think.
You should keep track of your old school chums.  Turns out she eventually joined the communist party.  On top of which, she's Lucy Angstrom Hirschfeld now, and she happens to be a writer for "Studio One" on CBS.
Well, then, why do they call you "Old Tim?"
Yeah.  I hope you don't mind.  I didn't know anyone lived here... well, besides Harry.  And me.
Yeah... me too.
I thought you...
That you got let go.
You look familiar, fella.  What's your name?
Mabel over there at the diner lost her husband Max.  Okinawa, I believe.
Thank you, Mr. Lawson.
No.  No, not Miss Sinclair.  I'm talking about Adele Lardner.
I'm Melanie Daniels. I'm sorry to bother you, but...
Which is why the mail in this town never gets delivered to the right place.  Did you want to see Cathy about something?
Thank you. It gives me something to do with my spare time.  There's a lot of spare time in Bodega Bay.  Did you plan on staying long?
No. Just a few hours.
You're leaving after you see Cathy?
Well... something like that.  I'm sorry. I don't mean to sound so mysterious.
Well, I'd really hope to rent it for...
Yes.
All right. 
Where are you from originally, Annie?
How'd you happen to come here?
Four years ago. Of course, that was shortly after his father died.  Things may be different now.
When I got back to San Francisco I spent days trying to figure out just what I'd done to displease her.
Nothing! I simply existed. So what was the answer? A jealous woman, right? A clinging possessive mother.  Wrong. With all due respect to Oedipus, I don't think that was the case at all.
Someone ought to tell her she'd be gaining a daughter.
What about Mitch? Didn't he have anything to say about this?
You get straight to the point, don't you?
I did.
It seems so pointless.  I think I'll go to sleep. This has been a busy day.  My luggage.
Never mind Lydia. Do you want to go?
Ohhh. Oh, the poor thing. He probably lost his way in the dark.
In a democracy, Cathy, everyone is entitled to a fair trial. Your brother's practice...
She said something about having to get home to take a call from her mother back East.
Take it into the living room, would you, hon?
Where?
The Brenners? Mr. and Mrs. Brenner?
The front door.  Isn't there a back road I can take?
I didn't want to come right down the road, where they could see me.
It's a surprise, you see.
D'you want me to order one for you?
Yes.
Near the top of the hill, you'll see the school and right behind it, the church. You head for the school. Now just past the school, you'll see a little house with a red mail box. That's where Annie Hayworth lives, she's the school teacher. You ask her about the little Brenner girl.
Because there are 8,650 species of birds in the world today, Mr. Carter. It's estimated that five billion, seven hundred and fifty million birds live in the United States alone. The five continents of the world...
Shall I call the doctor?
I don't think it's that serious. You want to sit up here?
We'll make our own fog.
Yes, lovebirds. We couldn't let you...
In a bird shop.
I suppose so. Her father owns a big newspaper in San Francisco.
She is the one who jumped into that fountain in Rome last summer, isn't she?
Yes, Mother.
If there are... larger birds, Mitch... they'll get into the house.
What happens when we run out of wood?
I'm sorry, Mitch.
If they are?
Oh, thank you.
Then he saw.
I couldn't ask you to.
My wife found a bird in the back seat of her car once.
What I'm trying to say, Mitch, is these things happen sometimes, you know? Ain't much we can do about it. 
He's not home.
Monday?
I'd hold the birds for him, but I'm going away myself. Someone's got to feed them, I suppose.
I'm awfully sorry.
Lovebirds, sir?
Well... yes, sir, there are.
The sign says strawberry finches.
Yes, we call them that too.  Ahhh, here we are, Lovebirds... 
Well, we can't just let them fly around the shop, you know.
Is that why you'd like to see everyone behind bars?
Annie. Annie Hayworth.
It's still bleeding a little. Here, let me put this on.
I loathe you. You have no manners. And you're arrogant and conceited and... I wrote you a letter about it, in fact, but I tore it up.
None of your business.  Am I still bleeding?
San Francisco's a long way from here.
How does Mother know what I like to do?
Yes, but...
...who didn't much care for propriety or convention or...
Yes.
Because it seemed stupid and foolish.
But not for me.
I'm trying to get you to stay for dinner. We're going to have a lot of roast left over.
I couldn't possibly. I have to get back.
Helping travelers.
I'm glad you do.
It's hard to believe anything at all happened yesterday, isn't it? It's so beautiful and still now.  I think I've got it all figured out, by the way.
Of birds?
And all the while, that sparrow was getting in his little messages. Birds of the world, unite!
Mmm?
It makes you feel as if they're... they're waiting or... resting... or....
How long have they been gathering there?
Mitch...
Oh, good! Oh, wonderful.
Yes, certainly. 
That would be just fine.  Hello, Charlie, this is Melanie. I want you to do a favor for me.  No, this is a small one.  Pressure you? Why, Charlie darling, would I try to pressure you?  Will you call the Department of Motor Vehicles for me and find out who owns this license plate? DKQ dash one seven six.  Yes, a California plate.  No, I'll stop up there in a little while. Is daddy in his office?  Oh. No, no, I don't want to break in on a meeting. Just tell him I'll see him later. Thank you, Charlie. 
Thank you.  Do you know Dan Fawcett's number?
What do you think they were after, Miss...?
For what purpose?
I have seen jays doing everything it is conceivable for jays to do. Ornithology happens to be my avocation, Miss Daniels. You're talking about preservation of the species, a hen protecting her young. There's a vast difference between...
Yes. I have never known birds of different species to flock together. The very concept is unimaginable.  Why if that happened, we wouldn't have a chance. How could we possible hope to fight them?
It's happening. Isn't that a good enough reason?
Mrs. Bundy, you said something about Santa Cruz. About seagulls getting lost in the fog, and heading in for the lights.
Can we go on living here otherwise?
Makes a lot more sense than... well, an attack.
Then let's go. Now!
Take it easy, lady.  There isn't a bird anywhere in sight.
That's right.  Gray, the cabman. I've had a bit of dealing with MacFarlane in the past, you know.
But can't you give me any idea?
Of course I will.
Good morning, Mr. Fettes.
Aye.
They did not tell you how that porter cried out in the witness box when the Kings Counselor pressed him hard -- how he cried out that he was shielding a gentleman of consequence.
It's a gift to my people -- and I see MacFarlane and Gray-- the pit yawns for them and the flames -- and I would have you away from them and safe out of the torment.--
Excuse me.
I thought only the best students were made assistants.
Well? And are you not a good student?
From the Municipal Council -- they're the bodies of paupers --
What the devil do you mean?  You have your lodgings, a certain stipend -- I thought I had arranged everything for you --
Believe it or not.  It's best for you to pretend that you do.  After all, it was you who ordered this specimen, received it here, and paid for it.  That makes you a party to murder.
I've just been to see Mrs. Marsh. Georgina is doing splendidly.  The incision has healed -- clean and fine -- but she doesn't seem to have any desire to walk.
That's only our duty, Fettes -- that's the end at which we aim with all this nasty business.
But she must want to stand.  She must want to walk.
Confound me, the child's a cripple, of course she wants to walk.  Child, I say to you get up out of that chair and walk.
Gray -- I'm rid of him --
No room there. We'll have to set it between us.
An old acquaintance, eh?
You will not have it?
You're uncommon friendly tonight, Toddy. More like the old days.
I've ordered nothing from you.
The Resurrection business? That may end sooner than you think. New laws may come.
Because it would be a hurt to me to see you no more, Toddy. You're a pleasure to me.
No, Joseph. I'm not angry -- here -- another glass of brandy --I'll wager it's better than the doctor's.
That was Hare's end. Ah, you should have seen him on the streets, when he saw some old beldam deep in drink how he cozened her!
I'll show you how it was done, Joseph. -- I'll show you how they "Burked" them.
How long after that was the paralysis complete?
It comes at intervals.  They used to be months apart -- but they've been growing more frequent --  much more frequent.
You may deny the devil, Toddy, but you'll not rid yourself of him by saying the devil is dead.
Aye.
You sent them. I had no choice.
Yeah?  I see doubt oozing out your arm. Where do people go when they kill their girlfriends?
What do they do that they had to kill her?
This is not just some "thing." It's A C zero zero five.
A scar. On the arm. Of the man who planted this in Alex Corvis's car.
Bitch killed herself when she shot a cop in the leg. If she' just acted like a girl nothing would have happened.  So you're right, spooky. Happy?
I want you to think of me as the guy who killed you.
I want Lauren. I want my life back. I want... to know why.
You're him. Corvis.
No! Why are you haunting me?
Yes I do, I really do.
So you're going to kill him?
I used to be so proud of him. My big deal daddy. And now, he's just a crook. Worse even. And the weird thing is...
Shut up.
Guy dressed for Halloween?
Christ. It was Corvis. Tommy Leonard was right.
I do. Every day.
Erin knows, doesn't she?
Look, I'll tell you the truth. Jannie drove us and was supposed to drive us back, she has a license, but I mean... look at her.
What did I say?
Erin. I know you think she's been talking to you.
It still doesn't mean...
I'm never going back in that house again. Get away.
I find it works well enough to get me from one planet to another.  I understand you've called a meeting to study our space ship.
I assure you such power exists.
Would such, a demonstration be possible before the meeting?
Yeah, sure. Mom, do I have to go to school tomorrow?
Okay.
Gee, why, Mom? He's my best friend... And he's awful good in arithmetic. He even helps Professor Barnhardt.
I thought that was only for bombs.
Yes -- I think so.
No foolin'? Will you?
Well, sure, but--
He told me this morning when I examined him. He's seventy-eight.
I don't believe it.
Perhaps you'd rather discuss it personally with the President--
I'm afraid that would be a little awkward. It's -- it's completely without precedent. And there are practical considerations -- the time involved -- the enormous distances.
You must have a rather strange impression of us.
I am not concerned, Mr. Harley, with the internal affairs of your planet. I consider that to be your business -- not mine.
I intend to explain. To all the nations -- simultaneously.  How do we proceed, Mr. Harley?
I can judge only by what I see.
I'm afraid my people haven't.  I'm very sorry -- I wish it were otherwise.
You still haven't answered my question.
The picture starts at eight-fifty.
You think it's all right for you to stay here?
All right, Tom -- it's true. I know it's true.
He's a menace to the whole world! It's our duty to turn him in.
Is that what you're thinking about?
Warm and friendly and intelligent--  You know -- he's the only real friend I've made since I've been here.
May I see you for a minute?
Who?
Gort?  But he's a robot. I mean -- without you, what could he do?
I think I'm very lucky. You don't always get a chance to recognize a mistake before you make it.
I'd give you a very good price.
But I suppose you know the answer.
We don't ride with vampires.
Fine!  Stay here!
Santa Carla has become a haven for the undead.
The nightcrawler.  The bloodsucker.
El Vampiro.
The baddest!
Now I get it... you're like those people in the airport trying to get you to give them money. You're part of a cult.
Chill out Edgar.
There's a cop behind us.
Sam, don't --
It's called the Indian walk. Walkin' without makin' a sound.
Whatcha doin' over here?
Who, Laddie?
I watch him all day.  The only time I have more myself is at night.  Let Grandpa watch him.
I thought we were poor.
Mom.  I think we've got to have a long talk about something?
We can't talk about it on the phone.
Do you mind?  It was a real scary comic.
But, Mom...
Boy!  <u>Somebody</u> areound here sure has bad breath!
He doesn't walk all over me.
Let me tell you something about boys.  They're like weeds.  They grow best when they're ignored.
Well... what do I know?  I'm a bachelor.  Lucy... this is going to be a very special night, I promise you.
Don't be a baby.  That didn't hurt and you know it.
When?
That night in the cave -- that wasn't wine they gave me to drink... it was blood!  David's blood.  I'm one of them, Star!  I'm just like them!
Will you give Mom a break?
I was here first.
Then what's the rush?  You're chasing that girl, why don't you just admit it?  I'm at the mercy of your sex glands!
Entertain yourself.
And the horse you rode in on. Sixteen for how long?!  You can't predict this time of year...
Let's load 'em.
What was he doing in the rec room?
If the weather clears enough before we reach anybody -- I'm sending you and Doc up to MacMurdo...
... I think the whole process would have taken an hour... maybe more. And then I suppose both would have changed back to dog form.
We'll see...
You lying bastard...
The dogs?
Look, I'm just guessing...
I don't know how.  Because he's different than we are.  Because he's a space guy.  What do you want from me, anyway.  Go ask Blair.
How the fuck do I know?!
Gee, thanks!
Neither will we.
Could be important work.  Might as well bring it back.
Enough, MacReady!
Didn't think you'd use that fibrillator on Norris if you were one of them.
Yes, there is.  I'd like to go up.
A day or so ago... I guess.
How far's that?
We're a thousand miles from anybody else, man.  It's going to get a hell of a lot worse before it gets better.
I'm sure a lot of you already know.
I'm going to blow the generator when you get back.  He'll have to come for us -- or freeze.
Forget about Childs.  He's over.
You crazy?  He might be inside already?
MacReady, that you?
It's the generator I think!  No power.
When do you think it got to him?
'Fraid so.  Just a regular old... mud carrier.
Kalen... Do you have any idea where they take them?
We're not supposed to think about it.  But I dream about it sometimes...
Where?
Who doesn't know the Morlocks?
I was lucky.  The others weren't.
You'll live like this forever. Alone.  You were meant to help.  To be with people.  Not like this.
It was meant to.
Nothing to do, I'm afraid.  I'm just a librarian after all.  Wasn't exactly made for all this swashbuckling.  Very Byronic end, though.  I appreciate that.  Do you know Byron?
I'm babbling.  Good to have someone to talk to for a change... But you need to go.  Take her out of here...  ... I don't have long.
I'm going to end it, Alexander.  As we discussed...
I'll never forget this.
Well, Alexander, as a fellow scientist I know you have a thousand questions --
They survived above.  Became what they are.
So you take their best...
No...
It's always the tiger for you, Alexander, haven't you learned that by now?...
I was getting to that... The moon has reached the gravitational Roche Limit, 7,300 miles above the surface of the Earth.  This has created pressure on the lunar stratum beyond gravitational tolerances.  It might be helpful to know that the nearest public evacuation shelters can be found at Grand Central Station, Madison Square Garden --
Dance with me...
Alex, it's just the zoo.
I've seen it.
Let them.
You know generally teachers are supposed to teach real equations that add up to real numbers.
That's where you're wrong.  I will change it.
What makes you say that?
More than 800,000 years.
Why would you do that?
Not like this... They don't seem so bright with all the city lights.  I never really noticed them much...
We all have that dream.
Did you have fires at night?
Mara...?
Here?
Imagine that.
Well... perhaps I have "deviated" the tiniest bit.
No, sir --
For our sake, I hope not.
I have no doubt of that.  I'll come by in the morning and we'll arrange it.  Goodnight, Mrs. Watchit.
It's not my job to believe you.
Don't act like I don't know what's real. [Beat] I'm not the one that's crazy here.
I've managed to every Sunday of my life. [Beat] Some of us are God- fearing men, Starks.
No. I'm not his son. I'm him. [Beat] What? You look like you've seen a ghost. You can come here and touch me, old man. I'm the real thing.
You may have known my father, William Starks.
I never touched your father! I swear!
Our car won't start.
[Beat] In case you get lost, or can't remember who you are.
His body was found New Year's Day, 19...1993. At Alpine...
I don't know. But he did die. STARKS falters under the news. JACKIE looks around, through her now blurred eyes, like she might find some help in the apartment. She settles for the BOTTLE of VODKA on the table, lowers the iron fork and takes a long heavy drink, then laughs nervously as she looks up.
No, it's not. [Beat] It's December 25th, 2004.
I'll leave. But look at me. Look at my face, Jackie. I'm not lying. I met you and your mother. I told you then that I'd lost my memory. [Beat] There was no one for miles around so I know you know there's no way I could have known that from a pair of dog tags you had lying around.
Yes.
If they don't take me out before then. [As an afterthought] What's the net?
I have no idea.
You think Lorenson kills you?
It's not a prison, it's a hospital. There's got to be some way out of there and you've got to find it...
112 Orchard Way. [Realizing, in a whisper] You're not coming back, are you?
Then, where are you going?
How?
Because I don't think I'm crazy.
No. The real events that have happened to me have been fucked up. Not my mind.
No. I don't want it to.
You told me this was how it happened.
You did, in the future. You figured it out because a part of you already knows this. That's how it works. [Beat] I'm just telling you something you already know, even if you haven't realized it.
Sure. It's an easy address. A little far out there, but easy enough.
Why?
So what am I supposed to do?
[Beat] I'm not deaf.
I'm not sure.
I don't think so.
[Beat] I was dropped off.
Maybe. [Beat] Maybe not.
How?
Have a good day at work today.
Uh-huh.
You want anything special for dinner?
Go fuck yourself.
Why?
Well, maybe if they were trying to hurt you or one of the kids.  I'm sure I could shoot someone if they tried to hurt one of the children.
In the leg.
Aw, God.
You might say we had a meeting of the minds, yes.
If waitin' tables in a bar don't make you an expert on human nature, then nothin' will, and I could've told you that Harlan Puckett would end up buyin' it in a parkin' lot. I'm just surprised it didn't happen before now.
You didn't happen to notice what kind of car they were driving?
Is there any reason to believe they've left the state?
It's him.
Oh, definitely.
We don't have a whole lotta choice, do we?  I can't figure out if they're real smart or just really, really lucky.
The women are armed, Hal.  This is standard.  Now you stay calm here. These boys know what they're doin'.
J.D.!  Just tell me.  I know you're not some schoolboy.  Now come on, nobody ever tells me shit.
I'm just some guy.  A guy whose parole officer is probably having a shit fit right about now.
You're a bank robber?
Well, first you pick your place, see, then I'd just sit back and watch it for awhile.  Ya gotta wait for just the right moment, which is something you know instinctively, that can't be taught.  Then I'd waltz on in...
God.  You're a real live outlaw!
Hi.  I'm okay.  How are you?  Long time no see.
Louise, let me call you back after I wire it, so you'll know which office to go to.
Good.  That was good.  Where do I go?
Peaches.
Can we get another room?  Just put it on my credit card.
It's me.
Maybe.
I don't know.  Warm stuff, I guess. It's the mountains.  I guess it gets cold at night.  I'm just gonna bring everything.
And steal Darryl's fishin' stuff.
Aw, shit, Thelma, he's gonna kill you.
Another hour of so.  We've got enough food for a month.
Well, I've had it up to my ass with sedate!  You said you and me was gonna get outta town and, for once, just really let our hair down. Well, darlin,' look out 'cause my hair is comin' down!
Tell them what?!  What, Thelma? What do you think we should tell them?
I don't know.  Just tell 'em what happened.
What?  Oh, I don't know.  Let me look.
I've been tellin' you that for the last ten years.
That's puttin' it mildly.
Nothing.  I'm not gonna tell him a thing.  The least I can do is not make him an accessory any more than he already is.
No.
What happened?
Yes!  I believe I am!
Yeah.
I want you to call Darryl.
What for?
Murder one!  God, Louise, can't we even say it was self-defense?
They don't know that!  It was just you and me there.  I'll say he raped me and you had to shoot him!  I mean, it's almost the truth!
Let's get it over with.
What.
Just past Boise City.
Those, too, but you know those little hairy ones?  Those flat-faced little fuckers with those ugly goddamned teeth?
I always wanted to travel.  I just never got the opportunity.
What?!  What about him?!
Okay, Louise... It's okay.
About how fast was I going?
It's good.  It's what the pioneers ate.
Yeah, you want it?
Are you alright?
You know why.  You already said.
No, Louise, you said the first part. I said all the rest.
You're not gonna give up on me, are ya?
What do you mean?
And we have to decide whether we want to come out of this dead or alive.
Pass him!
We're not giving up, Thelma.
What are you talkin' about?
Go.
Fuck you.
Damn.  I hate that!  I hate bein' called a beaver, don't you?
What?
Heavy? Heavy?! What I wouldn't give to know what heavy feels like, you insensitive prick.
Woogie, I caught you red-handed.
I just told you, she's half Asian. half American. They're all good looking. You could mate Don Rickles and Yoko Ono and they're going to have a gorgeous kid. It's a foolproof combo.
Each day is better than the next.  Have you ever been, you know... in love with someone?
Look, I admit it was brief, but it was definitely love. Crushes don't last twelve years.
I mean since then.
Relax, this guy owes me a big one. A couple years ago he got in a jam up in the Boston office; some bullshit about padding his resume -- like we haven't all done that. Anyway, they were going to let him go but his mother wrote a tear-jerker letter that ended up on my desk.
That sneaky prick was probably practicing his jai alai.
And this adversely affects me how...?
I'm usually too tired to be.
Jesus Christ you're right.
You hot shit. Ya look fuckin' pisser.
I'm doing okay.  I gotta get ready for work.
Healy, what I just tell you?
No thanks.
Pat Healy.
I already know it, Mary.
That's what I said, so I went out and got him a leash you know, one of those clothesline runners for the backyard. He's got plenty of room out there to dig. The kid's really blossomed. Now I can take him to ball games, movies -- you know, happy stuff.
Sadly, no. Well except for the lint.
You look great.  Hey, Mare, do I have a rip in the back of these pants?
Not to worry. So... see you tonight, right? Right?
I don't buy it.
You can't be serious.
Look, let's forget it. Let's forget the whole thing.
I get one hundred a day plus expenses.
You get fifty a day, period. It's a business trip, they'll pay for your expenses.
That I couldn't say. Let me ask you something: Was she a little big-boned in high school?
So she's married?
Nope. Never been.
Anyway, the good news is I have all the information you need. Got it from her bookie -- nice guy. You should definitely call her, Ted. I mean she's a real sparkplug, that one. She seems determined to get those rugrats off welfare and with your help I'll bet she does it.
It's a goddamn bunion. It'll heal.
Oh. I thought  That's not it anyway. I know this doesn't make any sense to you, but I just can't turn it off that fast. I still feel something for her.
Japan? What's she doing in Japan?
What do you mean 'why'?
What?! You're calling me a stalker?
That's right -- if you weren't you would've looked for her yourself!
What?
Yes yes, I did get my degree up there.
Nice smokescreen, isn't it?
Do you know the... soccer stadium?
Nice.
You fucking prick, we had a deal -- you said you wouldn't fuck me and I wouldn't fuck you until we had this fuck out of the fucking picture.  You crossed the line, man.
Like I'm going to try to figure out a guy who's idea of courting is blowing farts in the chick's face
But here's the rub. The guy I'm talking about has got to be self- employed.
Neighborhood Watch? Is that what you call listening in on stranger's phone conversations?
Oh, yeah, of course, dear.
Must have a sweet tooth. See if you can find some cookies.
So maybe I could find a nice gentleman to take you to the movies.
Puffy, get over here.
Well that's what I'm trying to figure out. How long have you known him?
Tucker, I appreciate you doing all this, but I'm really strapped for time here and --
Okay, just calm down. It's going to be okay.
Don't get all gooey on me now, you'll give me a big head.  The important thing, Doctor, is you've got to distance yourself as much as possible without pissing this psycho off.
A real Clydesdale, huh Warren?
The prom -- you going?
Yup, that's right. Junior prom... kinda.
Funny story. You see, me and a buddy of mine decided to... ah... you know... just... drive down.
Mary, we haven't seen each other in twelve years.  Don't make me wait another day.
I say they should put more meats on a stick, you know? They got a lot of sweets on sticks -- popsicles, fudgesicles, lollipops -- but hardly any meat.
I agree there should be more.
Yeah?
We've got a lot in common.
We'll see. If it doesn't, what the hell, at least I gave it a shot.
You're Woogie?
Um, hi, I'm Ted Peloquin. I'm here to take Mary to the prom.
It.
What?! No please, sir --
I don't know. It's not like it was a well thought-out plan.
No, that's really unneces --
Would you shhh! Mary's gonna hear us.
Eh.
Bye, Ted.
With all due respect, Mr. Secretary, we were not firing on the ship. Firing on a ship means attacking the ship. We were not attacking the ship. We were firing over it.
Complete snowjob. And then we went out and told the country they weren't putting missiles into Cuba.  By the way, you realize we just lost the midterms.
So if there are alternatives that make sense -- and I'm not saying there are -- we need 'em. Need 'em fast.
We're split down the middle. If I held a vote I think airstrike would beat blockade by a vote or two.
...I know. CIA and the military fucked us on the Bay of Pigs.
It'll be the principals, a couple of the key guys from each department: the Executive Committee of the National Security Council. We'll call it EXCOM.
He's right. And things are happening too fast. It smells like the Bay of Pigs all over again.
No, Ken. I need to see him now...
All right. Then I guess it's time.
I don't know, Helen. I want you to keep the kids close tomorrow. Leave the T.V. on, sleep with it on in the bedroom until I tell you you can turn it off.
What happens to you? I'm not leaving without you.
I'm giving you a chance here: talk to me. You can influence how this thing unfolds.
Wrong, and you get to wax my car.
Yeah.
Then somebody'd better deny it publicly.
Listen to me, goddamn it. We're talking about a possible nuclear war. You dropped the ball on Bay of Pigs --
Will somebody find out what's going on?!
Our police are afraid of them. Please get them out of here.
I'm a full blood Oglala Sioux, born and raised on this reservation.
No, Ray. You're gonna have to blame that on your grandmother.
Check him out, Ray.
Who the fuck is he?
Cooch. What's the Fort Laramie Treaty?
-- I know. I fed it, and I can't get rid of --
Your first homicide, that's gonna happen, Ray...
All I could think of was... not here. I don't wanna eat it on an Indian Reservation, three thousand miles from home.
She's that subtle?
Watch out!
-- Leo wasn't killed here. He was dumped here. Out of a vehicle. Bald tread. Muffler held on with baling wire.
His spiritual mother...
Good question. Hardly sees anybody anymore. Hasn't left this place in twenty years. Did you bring some tobacco?
I don't see the connection.
Ray --
What are you talking about?
Sorry.
He tried to kill him twice before. That's a good place to start don't ya think? Leo was on the other side, wasn't he?
Yellow Bird committed suicide at three o'clock this morning. Some gung-ho agent from D.C. pushed him into a corner. You're playing a losing game. Pull over.
Yes, Washington sent me, Richard. They sent me here because this whole thing has been fucked. Do you know what I mean when I say this whole thing has been fucked, Richard?
What's with you people? Why do ya have to fuck with my head all the time? I came through, man.
What the fuck, man? What do you people want? I did what you wasi'cu's told me to do.
Leo Fast Elk... is alive.
What's Tashka Sha, speak English, speak English!
Red Deer Table! What's with you, man?
Uhhh...Anything I can do for you? She laughs again, doesn't know what it is...could be chemical, but she's instinctively attracted.
That's a big comfort to me.
Yes, ma'am.
Um. You.
Lieutenant...
I'm different.
Make what?
Okay, anything. Just...go. I've gotta work.
That's it, of course. When I'm up there and doing it, I'm cheating it every second. I'm subverting all laws...gravity...whatever. I'm skating the edge of it.
In that order?
That's what you get flight pay for.
Only when you're depressed. Then it passes.
I like to play "reality".
And that's one!
I know exactly what you mean.
Big talk for someone who's never been shot off her computer.
I hope you find him.
Sir. I was going Mach point one five.
You're crazy. We're level.
You're not. We're level. Look at the instruments, we're okay!
No! Now we're inverted!
TELL HIM, WILL YOU TELL HIM? OUR INSTRUMENTS ARE OKAY.
Just relax.
Is it the plane?
The plane is fine.
Yeah, I guess it is. We did it! We did it...Damn! We sure did it!
MUSTANG, THIS IS MAVERICK, REQUEST A FLYBY.
Well, it doesn't just happen, you gotta do something famous.
We're here because we're the best flyers in the wing. Not because of some MiG encounter.
Flaming Hooker. Sort of an institution around here. Or maybe this is the institution, I forget which. It's the house drink. It'll warm the cockles of your heart ... and other things depending on where you spill it.
Pay no attention to it. They're just trying to rattle you. It's all psychological. Sit down..and drink.
He should've had me. GOOSE Take it down. Let's bug out of here. Call for a draw.
Come on, relax...
You see all those guys with gold on their shoulders!!?... Oh, no, I think that was Johnson, Air Boss of the Kitty Hawk!
Come on, we beat an instructor. How many times in your life do you get to do a victory roll?
YOU GOT TOO MUCH NOSE TO TAIL -- I'M COMING IN.
LOOK OUT!
No. You can be mine!
Need a hint?
I think I can work it out on my own.
NOT ONLY THAT, BUT ZORRO GOT YOUR WINGMAN. NICE GOING.
Well, he's in trouble and he didn't even get here yet.
Speaking of feet, fuel's down to 4.0.  We're gonna get them wet unless we find a Sonoco station.
You're father was Marvin Mitchell..
Is that how you remember it?
All right.
My wife's house.
You may not think so, but you are.
I never heard that.
Over there man.
And you get a kickback.
Who are you?
Identification?
Sorry.  Too perfect.
But I thought...
Eight years.
Forty-one A, Ernie.
On his way.
Rekall?
"RekallRekallRekall."  You thinkin' of goin' there?
I did?
Up to the right.
I've got Quaid.
The door opened.  You got it.
You know I do.
Cohaagen says it's just a few extremists.
I'm late.
I swear to God!...I never saw you before six weeks ago!  Our marriage is just a memory implant -- agghh!
And falling in love?
Bullshit.
You're gonna love this. --We offer you a choice of alternate identities during your trip.
Let me go!
You couldn't get me a message?  You never wondered what happened to me?
Don't be ridiculous.
Jump!
All sorts of things.  You might even remember you loved me.
You two-faced-bastard.
I gave you?
No problem.
Breaker there, Earl.  What do you want us to do?
Phone's out.  Road's out.  We're on our own.
No problem.  Nice meeting you. Hope you get it sorted out.
No good.  You need major four- wheel-drive just to get up that jeep trail.
You bet.  You gonna be staying up here?
Nestor's out of town tomorrow.  We don't dig today.  We don't get paid today.  Damn it, Valentine, you never plan ahead.  You never take the long view.  Hell, here it is Monday and I'm already working on Wednesday.  It is Monday, right?
Hey, I don't want spend the night out here!
The rifle.
That <u>is</u> the plan...I mean, goddamn it!  What the hell are those things?  How could they bury an entire Plymouth station wagon?
<u>Why</u> would they do it?
Okay, now, how far's your truck?
Right.  We need to be talking about what we're gonna do.
Chuck him out the door!  Like a little hors d'oeuvre.
Hey, just 'cause you're no good with a rope...
<u>People</u>?  Hell, <u>National</u> <u>Geographic</u>.
You're not civil, you're glum.  We got the world by the tail with a downhill pull and all of a sudden you go glum on me.
Damn, Fred, you can't give away all those.
Just keep looking at that beautiful sky.
Yeah, good!  Something to keep them busy.  We need a decoy.
That-a-boy. Hospital.
Too fine, Badalato. The bad news is, you're gonna live.
Correct.
Bellevue. Straight up First --
-- With objection!
Do you see a toilet here you think is really me?
-- I don't care who you are. You could've been killed. Every man and woman in here has done hard prison time. And we look out for each other.
I can describe it.
How can you remember that?
Not at all --
Hey. You plan to be a criminal defense attorney, know this going in: Everybody's guilty.
...What do you mean?
I've heard from the last ballistics expert on the list. It's an even ten who say Shu's gun killed Jimmy Chin!
I am. Eddie -- we've got nothing.
I didn't put him in a wheelchair. Reynard did. He can get around without one -- it's all in my report.
"Painted"?
I don't know. The truth, maybe.
Jimmy Chin? Was that self-defense too?
See-cil. I'm Eddie Dowd, this is Roger Baron. We're lawyers.
Hey, Chinese people have this energy field that vibrates at a particular frequency.
They g-got the wrong g-guy.
Let's not drag the Constitution into this.
You know you're very tense, Mr. Reynard. Y'oughta take a week off, fly the wife and kids to Oahu.
Objection. The witness is not an expert in racial classification.
We just discovered him, your Honor! His appearance is critical to a fair presentation of our case! He is an inmate at Ossining Correctional and --
-- alleged crime --
I'd need a continuance. Three weeks at least.
I can't be expected to remember the name of every informant eight years after the fact.
But they've still got Laura Gordon -- and she was the closest, about 20 feet from the killer.
...And you were at the trial to... to see that justice was done?
I would tend to plead the Fifth.
Yeah, we do some of that.
By "takes care of," you mean "kills".
That's right.
Soldado.
Shu's the only one I know of...
Mr. Stipe. A young man named Jimmy Chin was shot to death eight years ago, in Chinatown. Do you remember talking to the police?
You're describing half the high school girls in America.  What is she doing right now?
Oh, come on, sweetie, give me one of your smiles.
You killed Mike.
The stuff we got last night.
Not tonight. Just give me something to take home to hold me over till tomorrow.
Well, little fella, we don't need any outside help here. I don't like you people sniffin' around my neck of the woods. In fact, when the state boys called me about a "J. Edgar" coming up I think I said, "So what?"
Teresa Banks had a ring. Any idea what happened to it?
Can you tell me who's trailer it was... and who stayed in the trailer?
Not that I know of. But arguments do happen, don't they?
ALBERT?
Anything else?
Where am I? And how can I leave?
No.
There was only one job. Teresa took the job. Her friend took a hike. Never saw her again.
We're heading into a difficult situation.
A blue rose.
Why couldn't he have just told you all these things?
I see. He does talk loud.
Gordon would not have sent us to Deer Meadow without thinking it was a high priority situation.
Cole said she was 17.
She must have known someone.
He's not the murderer.  But he's a bozo.
Thanks, Sam, for the good work. You have a good eye for detail.
Noooo...
Faster and faster. For a long time you wouldn't feel anything. Then you would burst into fire... forever.
Call me anything just don't call me late for dinner.
Okay, L.  I am your friend... always. But sometimes... lately... I feel that you don't like being around me because I am so uptight.  No, I am uptight. I hate it... I don't want to be this way, but Laura I don't... I mean... I'm your friend no matter what way you are.
YES YOU DO, DONNA. What a downer you are!!!
Yep...  Yes...  It is.
Who would do that?
I'm not.
We're on our way, Baby.
Laura, I'll meet you at 2:30 after phys. ed.
Okay.
It does matter. We're in love.
You're on somethin' again, aren't you?
Okay.  Oh god, it's Johnny Horne's birthday today.
You know it and I know it.
Everything, but everything.
Boating?
No.
I don't want to offend the customs of your country.
I saw a guy eat a fish eye once in Seattle. He was digging through his food with his chopsticks for about five minutes till he found the fish eye and he dropped it into his throat. I guess it must have gotten stuck in his uvula because right away he started to have trouble. His throat began to flutter there like there was a wind blowing. And he couldn't swallow and they rushed to him and loosened his collar and they were asking him if he was alright and he started to turn blue and his eyes started to roll back into his head and he still couldn't get the fish eye out and they tried to do a Heimlich maneuver. I went over to him as they were preparing to do an emergency tracheotomy. They were over him with a knife when he suddenly shot the fish eye out of his throat and right onto the ceiling. Splat! It just stuck up there and spread out. It was about the size of a half dollar. And that's why I don't ever eat fish eyes.
We throw away the whole head.
No, you haven't met him. Have you met him?
Look at this finger here.
How would you know if Bobby didn't give her that?
As if I didn't know.
I'm going to show you how to wash this tile and then you're going to do it.
What's with that Laura? Yeah, sure, take a look around. There's no one here anyway.
Very good.
How did you settle on the amount?
That that poor girl put her trust in the hands of two men who took her life, she's in a coma, her life is gone. She has no family, she has no home, she's tied to a machine, she has no friends -- and the people who should care for her: her Doctors, and you, and me, have been bought off to look the other way. We have been paid to look the other way. I came in here to take your money.  I brought snapshots to show you. So I could get your money.  I can't take it. If I take it. If I take that money I'm lost. I'm just going to be a rich ambulance chaser.  I can't do it. I can't take it.
Mickey told me to come back to work.
...yes. Get her on the phone...
...a Mrs. Doneghy called... I told you that.
Frank Galvin's... who's calling please? Bishop Brophy's office...
Through, through his book.
What book is that?
Uh-huh. Still practice a lot of medicine?
I'm on the staff of...
...to get her heartbeat back...?
Nothing further, your Honor.
Mr. Galvin, rebuttal?
Yes. Yes. I think so. I hope you'll be comfortable. I'm putting you up at my...
It's my opinion it took him much longer. Nine... ten minutes. There's too much brain damage.
No. No thank you, Doctor. You go home.
You know... sometimes people can surprise you. Sometimes they have a great capacity to hear the truth.
It's a common medical term.
Yes. I wrote it.
And you wrote that...
Yes? Galvin, right?
...and you're going to do that?
Yes.
The most respected...
...the case with anyone. And I'll meet you Tuesday, and we'll go over your testimony...
Yes.
Yes.
Why is that?
I was held up.
Thank you for seeing me.
I don't have a week. This case never should have come to trial. You know better. You're Mr. Independent. You want to be independent? Be independent now. I've got no sympathy for you.
I'd just like to get to the point, Mr. Galvin. Let's not waste these people's time. Answer the question, Mr. Witness. Please. Would a nine minute lapse in restoring the heartbeat in and of itself be negligence?
Damn right I'm done. I'm going to ask for a mistrial and I'm going to request that you disqualify yourself from sitting on this case. I'm going to take a transcript to the State and ask that they impeach your ass.
Still looking.
Oh, actually it was. Then why'd you call it off?
Maybe I can do something right.
What happened...?
You're going to stay here...?
Yes.
Well, then what are you doing here?
Who told you that?
Oh, yes, I do, Joe. Believe me. You say you're going to lose. Is it my fault? Listen! The damned case doesn't start until tomorrow and already it's over for you!
What would you like it to be to me...? I, I, I can't invest in failure.
No.
I'm sorry, Sir, we're not allowed...
Kathy Price.
I'll just take a minute. Deborah Ann Kaye. You know what I'm talking about. The case is going to trial. Our chief witness is a Dr. David Gruber, you know who he is?
You know what happened.
You know, you're pushy, fella...
A healthy young woman goes into the hospital to deliver her third child, she's given the wrong anesthetic...
...You saw her?
...fifty thousand dollars?
...and I have inquiries out to doctors, experts in the field... there is, of course, a problem getting a doctor to testify that another doctor's negligent...
Yes.
No, no, no. I have to talk to him. If I can only call him...
...You're 'sposed to be in court in ten days and she's telling me you haven't even met with them...
Frank, but not now. Frank. You're trying to wipe out some old business. But not now. I understand. But you go call 'em back. You call the Bishop back.
I've got my Dr. Gruber, says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anesthetic anyway, plus she came in complaining of stomach pains...
You got a good memory, Franky.
I'm going to get laid.
Rooney's protecting someone. Who is she protecting?
Read me what she said.
I need a cigarette!  She left my office four years ago, we're looking for a chart...  I need a cigarette...
I, what are you talking about? I talked to her this morning, and she said...
Yes.
We had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes.  We were trying to restore her...
Wait, wait, wait, you're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes...?
Yes.
Because she was anemic.  It's right there on her chart. Her brain was getting less oxygen anyway...
How'm I doing so far?
Huh.
Yeah.  No sense stayin' out here.
Darnedest thing I ever saw - the way that's unscrewing!
Automobile ignitions are insulated.
Didn't you have something to do with this?  I know you sent word to the Sixth Army Command!
If they're mortal, they must have mortal weaknesses.  They'll be stopped -- somehow!
But you're not going to.  You're not the kind.  You're tired, anyway.  You've been up all night.  You cracked up in a plane.  Slept in a ditch.  But you want to know something?  It doesn't show on you at all.
It was...  ...one of them!
I believe we can get a lead from their anaemic blood.
Not all.  Radio is out.  But our field phones are okay so far.
And they'll go out the minute there's another ray.  A cylinder reported down by Huntington Beach.  That's a job for the Navy.
From the data - and from that picture the Air Force took earlier tonight ...  ... what we've got in the gully out there is a guide ship.  One lands ... Others follow later.  They appear to clear an area, then drop in groups of threes, joined magnetically.  Is that possible?
But they're not human!  Dr. Forrester says they're some kind of an advanced civilization --
Sure, sure!  Everybody understands you wave the white flag, you wanna be friends.
Can I read it?
You get any sleep last night?
You probably were half awake and saw me get nicked by that picture glass.  Dreams work like that.  You want me not to go on this job?
Heather, has there been another call?
No.
No.
What?
He can follow the breadcrumbs, right?
Here.
When do you think it'll be done?
Really?  Hell, if having a screwy family made you crazy, the world'd be one colossal nuthouse.
Six weeks of this, and you're surprised you've got Freddy in your dreams?  Hell, Sonny Bono says after a while he was seeing his stalker everywhere.  Even at Mass.
I just can't.
Thanks.  Just give them the time he called.  They're keeping a list, supposedly.  Sorry.  My nerves are so raw these days.
That was Nancy, not me!
I can take it.
Phil, he's not looking inside.  He's just striking out at the world.
Hey!  Weigh!  Blow the man down...
Fifteen.
Butler, what'd I ever do to you?
You came back, Tod.  You came back.
It's me, don't you see.  Terry's right, I'm the escape hatch.  I disobeyed order.
No, I can't.
Gieg, Chuck.
Look, meet us out front when you're through.  If they try to take anything away from you like Johnny Quest up there, just make a list and we'll have 'em send it down to the boat.
Well, Romeo here was on harbor watch and managed to sweet talk one of the local girls to have a go in the bowsprit.
That's what they get for not locking the door.
Believe what?
Yeah.  How'd you do.
Me either.
It was a bad dream...
Yes.
Speak up boy!
They have every right Chuck.
So is violating international law.
I thought we'd have a better chance if I headed into the wind so we could spill air from our sails.
Oh, on the contrary, the Albatross is considered a very good omen.  It is said they embody the spirits of sailors passed on.  It's very bad luck if you kill one.  And dolphins too.
Look, you put me on this boat in the first place.  I didn't want to come but I did.  Why do you have to embarrass me.  Why can't you just leave me alone?
It has nothing to do with him.
You're officer of the watch, George.
They'll know about it in the morning.
Why would you do that?
Lemme go!  Lemme go!!
He didn't get to be Under Secretary of the Air Force by being neighborly.
Terry left his passport in Curacao. We could hide him...
No self respecting shark is gonna take a bite out of you.
There are some things that everybody does in the same language.
What?
Up you go.  Right now.
No.  Hate the fear inside of you! Climb like a man mister!  Hate it! Hate it away.  Hate your way up one more rung!!  Do it right now!!
What makes you so sure it was one?
... and that you invited him to strike you?  To fight it out on the deck of your ship?!
I used to helm a school ship.  A long time ago.
I don't know that anything could have prevented what happened.
What's that supposed to mean?!
Well, that's so good to hear, Artie. You know some of us depend on you down this way. You're so entertainin' and you get so many interestin' guests.
Y'all take American Express?
You know, I really do like a woman with tits like yours that talks tough and acts like she can fuck like a bunny... Can you fuck like that?... You like it like a bunny?... Huh?... Cause baby, I'll fuck you like a real good like a big ol' jack-rabbit bunny... Jump all around in that hole... Bobby Peru doesn't come up for air.
Thanks, Bobby, 'bout done.
Lula tell you she's pregnant?
Come on outside, I got somethin' to show ya.
What is it?
What's gonna happen when he sees me drivin' the car tomorrow?
Real good, Chet... It's been awhile.
Sounds right... I'll check it out.
You hitched yet?
United States Marine issue, before they made the unfortunate switch to the less dependable nine millimeters. I have it here, in my briefcase.
Don't know that I have... Should I know about you for anythin' in particular?
Don't fuck with me, man. You look like a clown in that stupid jacket.
This is a snakeskin jacket, and for me it's a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom.
This island of yours sounds like a kind of unpredictable place.
Oh God... OH GOD... Santos... Oh God Marietta... are you in on this?... OH GOD!!!
You're just jealous of Santos cause he's sweet on me.
Oh, Johnnie Farragut... Don't you trust your very own Marietta?
I'm stayin' right here by the phone until you find Lula, then I'm comin' to get her. You call soon's you got somethin', even if it's three in the a.m.
Honey, I have to ask you this... Is Santos involved in any of this?
Who?... Uncle Pooch?...
How'll he know what we look like? He seen our photo?
Wrong, baby. Your daddy never committed no murder. Musta been you didn't hear grandmama proper. He made some mistakes, is all. Your daddy ain't always been so lucky... We're almost at the depot, honey. Sit back a minute.
I really did miss your mind while I was out at Pee Dee, honey. The rest of you, too, of course. But the way your head works is God's own private mystery. What was it you was thinkin'?
Gee, Sailor. I'm sorry, honey. I never would have guessed it.
In a fire, as I recall.
That's true. Uncle Pooch wasn't really an uncle. He was a business partner of my daddy's? And my mama never knew nothin' about me and him - that's for damn sure. His real name was somethin' kind of European, like Pucinski. But everyone just called him Pooch. He came around the house sometimes when Daddy was away. I always figured he was sweet on mama, so when he cornered me one afternoon, I was surprised more'n a little.
That woman's laugh creeps me out. I heard somethin' like that... somewhere before... Sound'd like the wicked witch...
What's that, peanut?
Maybe two, three months after Juarez. I was visitin' my cousin, Junior Train, in Savannah, and we were at some kid's house whose parents were out of town. A girl comes up to me that was real tall, taller than me.
Her face was half-pushed into the pillow, and she looked back over her shoulder at me and said, 'I won't suck you. Don't ask me to suck you.'
Sorta brown, blonde, I guess. But dig this, sweetie. Then she turns over, peels off them orange pants, and spreads her legs real wide and says to me...
You guess? My parole was broke two hundred miles back when we burnt Portagee County.
They sure do stink.
Okay, manslaughterer who's broke his parole and got in mind nothin' but immoral purposes far's you're concerned.
Lula... I learned somethin' interestin' today on a science show I heard on the radio... How leeches is comin' back into style.
You think so, baby? Does my talkin' bother you, honey?
I know you're thinkin' that I got more'n some of my mama in me? Well, I couldn't help it. Sailor, I really couldn't. I'm sorry for that guy, but when he pulled that drippin' hunk of awful-smellin' meat out of his pocket? I near barfed. And them poor diseased puppies!
We'll find out in a hurry.
Honey, we bein' strangers here and all, this is the kinda place we don't want to make nothin' of nothin'.
Honey, I'm sorry. It wasn't nothin'. Come on and get up and we'll take off.
Oh shit...
How'd you know my daddy?
You upset with me?
Well, we're really out in the middle of it now, ain't we?
One bad car accident...
No, I don't think so, Sail. I just need to lie down.
Well, nothin' personal, but I ain't sure it's okay by me.
Yeah... He was lookin' for you.
Some... Sparky said Red's promised to have him and Buddy out of here by the weekend.
Just a place.
Mama, I'm hangin' up this phone now.
Have it your way... But you want it.
What does take care of him mean? Do you want me to give him food or some clothing?
Like an accident where maybe Lula might also get hurt?
No.
But where in the head? Not the chin, I hope.
Wrong! It's much better to blow a hole in the back of the head... right toward the bridge of the nose... Lots and lots of irreparable damage.
...Yes you heard me... Don't ever call back here again.
So maybe one night you got a little too close to the fire... And you're gonna get burned, baby... And besides that, you're shit... D'you think I'd let my little girl go with shit like you?... Why, you belong right here in one of these toilets.
That's pretty simplistic, don't you think?
Oh, well, that's just it. She's been coming down here, every half hour or so, to, sort of, check on me. If I'm not here, she might... call the police or... something.
So I hear.
Lay off Pittsburgh. It's one of the great cities.
It was Jerry Nathan's. He owed me money.
This morning. I found a note in the kitchen.
Huh uh. A jockey. His name's, um, Curtis... Curtis Hardapple.
Not Curtis.
Where would we go?
What? Ohhhh. Is that... it?
Good God. Let's go rescue him.
Maybe... I don't know.
Only in your bones?
The truth. I know that's always been real important to you. Okay, check this out...
Nevertheless. There's a police officer standing on the porch and I don't think he's going away.
The Chancellor's here? Now?
It seems to me that girl would let you borrow her pancreas.
Only now I'm starting to think the car wasn't exactly Jerry's to give.
Uh huh. So. We find Vernon, we find the car. We find the car...
There's only one problem, Tripp. We don't know his real name. We just made it up. In fact, we made the whole guy up.
No wonder he screwed us over.
No...
She told you about...
No. There's no one here.
As long as it looks like her, I don't care. You know what I'm saying?
Grady, it's Sara. Thank God you're there. You won't believe what's happened.
How you choose to live your own life is your business. But you be careful with that boy, Grady. With James. He belongs to somebody else.
It's very convincing.
So did Gene Tierney. She's in it too.
You're right.
Really?
You mean, with your wife leaving you and all?  Hannah mentioned something about it. About a note.
I've got tenure.
That's just what they used to say in the ads. Come on, Crabtree, I know you're holding...
Can I ask you something about her?
Oh.
Who?
Colon cancer.
Carvel? Where's Carvel?
What kind of dancer?
Didn't you say your Mom went to Catholic school?
Amazing.
Maybe I just needed the moment to present itself.
I just wanted a little sip? Tell me, James, exactly what point was it that you turned into Serpent Boy?
Okay.
In the crawl space, with the rats and the casks of Amontillado. Come on. Up.
I'm a little worried, James.
Me? Sure. Why?
Actually, He's not the Chancellor's -- What?
Who does?
It beats 'What's your major?'
Uh huh. Well, thanks for the thought, but, as shocking as this may sound, I'm not the first writer to sip a little weed. And furthermore, it might interest you to know that one book I wrote, as you say, 'under the influence,' happened to win a little something called the PEN award which, by the way, I accepted 'under the influence.'
I don't believe I know where the upstairs guest room is.
I think Walter would find this a little more than surprising.
She's left the room before. She always came back.
And? Are you going to tell him?
No. Maybe. I don't know. I don't know what I'm going to do.
Don't. I know what you're going to say.
I love you, Grady.
I know that. I know what's at stake here...
That... and you.
And what do you think you might have said?
I said it didn't sound like you.
I believe you. Did that nice doctor let you out? Or is this you improvising again, Grady?
Oh?
What's that?
It's three-thirty, Grady.
Sara. I'm in love with her.
Hey, Professor Tripp.
Only when I'm working.
As a heart attack.
Neurologist? Why? What's wrong?
Horses, right. Vernon something...  Hardapple.
We figure the perpetrator let him out. He's blind and we figure he just wandered off and got run over.
The perpetrator.
That's all right. We'll find him.
No shit.
I just recommended you. You still had to prove yourself.
K through sixth.
I remember when they all referred to me as "the little spic poor Annette married." Except her brother. You treated me with respect.  Look, you paid your dues. Your slate is clean now.
Fucking Tigers. They got no pitching except for a bunch of green kids straight out of Double A or Southern Cal.  How was the party?
It's not what you think.
In that birch tree is a nest.
I don't like starlings.
Try.
Why don't you just tell me?
Neither do I.  What's the one with the woodsman?
Little Red Riding Hood.
I didn't say what time the assault occurred.
Then I'd say you're a lucky fellow.
'Fraid not.
You are in.
Why's that?
Robin?
Would you like to sit on my lap?
Are you sure?
You seem a little hostile today.
What?
A diary?
No way.
Oh. It never crossed my mind.
Honest? Your cheery personality makes my skin itch.
Forget it.
I don't feel anything.
I'm not that crazy.
Talking to you is like riding on a merry-go-round.
We have a few more minutes.
Will I ever be normal?
Then go see a therapist who will tell you you're normal!
You don't know!
I don't know.
That's my answer.
Hey, Rosen, you going to hypnotize me?
Where?
In my bed, Rosen. Where do you think?
I don't like nobody behind my back!
You felt pleasure.
Time.
Yeah, I'm fucking fantastic.
I'm all right.
Me?
Yeah, you.
What?
I'll buy a plant.
My place faces a truck street. I've got cracks in every window from the shaking.
Why do you want to know?
No you're not.
Is that all?
What?
No. Prison is time. That's it. You think time, you feel time, you hear time. Your heart doesn't beat to live, it just beats... time.
And what do you tell yourself now?
Why not tell me now?
I think it's a fucking good idea.
Who doesn't?
Yeah.
Not when they fly.
We were due to go back out on the same ship. Six months of tests.  If you were married you got a state-room.  Otherwise it was bunks.
Kirkhill?  That guy doesn't know his butt from a rathole.  Hey, Perry!
Folks, I've just been told to shut down the hole and prepare to move the rig.
Hey, you okay?
I was, but I managed to bum a ride on the last flight out here.  Only here isn't where I left it, is it, Bud?
I'm switching off now.
Not particularly.  Jeez, look where this is set! Morons.
No.
Whose then?  Lindsey?  Talk to me...
If you say so.  It could be anything.
I'm telling you what is there.  You're just not hearing.  The impulses somehow aren't getting from you ears to your brainpan.  There's something down there.  Something not... us.
Yeah.  So sue me.
Deepcore, this is Cab One.  We need assistance, over.  Deepcore, this--
Calm down, Bud.
Aaargh!!  I'm freezing!
I can't afford slack, Brigman.
Yeah!  I mean, I don't know... it looks right.
You watch yourself.
Not us.  Not human.  Get it?  Something non- human, but intelligent...
How deep?
Check this out.
It's twitching but it's below the line you said was safe.
Bud, according to Monk here, you just set a record for the deepest suit dive.  Bet you didn't think you'd be doing this when you got up this morning.
Ask him a pressure effects.  Tremors, vision problems, euphoria.
I'm thirsty.
If I had a man waiting for me for half an hour and whom I hadn't seen for a month ...
I didn't know one could sleep so well on a yacht. It lulls you ...
But how could you say such a thing?
Have you decided?
What were you and Anna arguing about?... Excuse me for being so indiscreet, but this is serious...
Oh, no... please... not here.  It looks too dangerous.
And why haven't they left each other?
Has she ever spoken to you about me?
Then I'll go with you.
But then when will we see each other?
And what about you?
Don't think that I want to save myself from any embarrassment, from the awkwardness of meeting Anna... It's not that; it's that you can say certain things easier if you're alone. Please, Sandro, do try to understand me... It would look like I was trying to influence you, to force you, to control you... and that makes me feel uncomfortable...
What! Get married?
Nothing.
Why?
Tell me once more.
But Corrado...  If something is beautiful why shouldn't one say so?
What do you think?
It wouldn't really do you any harm to skip a meal.
What is it?
And you expect to find him in here? Go and ask Claudia.
Ask her.
Giulia, don't you understand that the more involved you become with people, the more difficult it is to speak with them?
But how could they pose like that? I couldn't.
I ... I ... wasn't feeling well ... I.. I was sleeping... I don't know anything ... I ... I'm all mixed up and ...
Then it's impossible for her to know me. In the villa where I'm at, we have a male gardener.
Because this is a Chinese radio.
Don't worry, we've got everything.
What boat?
And how come you're up so early?
I'll go and get my valise.
Oh, no, not at all. And then you know very well that he'll forgive you anything; just as long as you admit to him that you're a worse driver than he is...
No, I'm not. Why do you think she does all this? It's one of the many ways she can put herself on display. When you bait the trap, the mouse will snap. To tell you the truth,  if it wasn't for the fact that one hundred thousand lire represents my whole month's salary, well... But you had something you wanted to ask me?
I'm a blimp.
Who told you this?
Agnes...
God blew up the Hindenburg. He'll blow me up, that's what she said...
Yes, of God.
Why?
I don't know.
Dear Jesus...
Yes Mother.
Yes, Mother.
Should you see a doctor?
That was the beginning, the night of the conception. That's why she burnt the sheets.
No I don't.
Let's talk about something else.
I don't know.
Anything... may I sit down?
Well, who in particular?
Uh huh.
Yes.
Who?
Oh, yes!
You've been alone together?
And you like that?
Agnes, how are babies born?
No... no, I'm tired of talking, I've been talking for weeks, nobody believes me when I tell them anything... nobody listens to me.
I've stopped menstruating
She said all of God's angels would want to sleep beside me if they could. I liked that.
No, only when she felt like it. She brought me up here last winter and the next day she died.
Numbers... you can spend your whole life counting and never reach the end.
I don't understand them either. Do you suppose I was dropped on my head?
You have trouble sleeping?
How did she know that?
Why not?  Mmm?
She'd get angry.
Why not?
Because I don't want one.
A mistake...
That's because you keep reminding me. If you go away then I'll forget.
She can.
She tells you you're ugly?
Yes.
How does she know that?
And why am I here?
It came out of me.
Why?
Would you like to tell me?
I can't tell you that.
We went to chapel for vespers.
Who?
Why isn't anyone coming?
They can't hear me that's why.  Oh God... I don't wanna...
Go away, I don't want you here.
I want you to remember if you can a night last January. The night Sister Paul died. Do you remember.
Agnes?  Who?  Mother Superior?
Nobody is interested in sending a nun to prison.
The bishop is breathing down our necks.
Why?  You've done nothing to show any progress.
I'll have a decision by next week.
You have proof?
I don't understand. Are you expecting me to..?
She undressed alone... she bathed alone.
The science of psychiatry.
How could she have a baby and know nothing of sex or birth?
I've already told you what I thought.
Who?
When did you first learn about her... innocence, the way she thinks?
Do you remember anything unusual happening at the time?
Do you have a... a diary or a day book?
Oh, Dear God, I should have guessed...
What the hell has the Catholic Church got to do with you?
So you left the Church because you had freckles?
No, it reminds me.
Mary Magdelen?
Oh, you've come a long way baby.
Yes, but goodness has very little to do with it. Not all the saints were good, in fact some of them were a little crazy. But... they were still attached to God. Agnes has that birth.  No more... we're born, we live, we die. No room for miracles.  Oh my dear, how I miss the miracles.
Well give me a reasonable explanation
There as no man in the convent on that night and no way for any man to get in or out.
She is an innocent.
Because it's murder we're talking about. Aren't you concerned about what she told us about the other person in her room.
If you believe this is murder, it is the Crown attorney you have to talk to, not me. And definitely not Agnes.
That's a lie.
You hid the wastepaper basket in her room.
No!
Wasn't it!
Lay them down.
Fifteen and two thirds, actually.
You heard, it gets on my wick.
Yeah, I've blown school out.
Yeah.
I'm a deserter, too.
Oh.
They'll be here.
Sorry? 
Ah ... a shamus, eh?
Yeah, I know, that's why I took up the drums. It's me active compensatory factor.
Oh, my God, he's a natural.
Oh, you mean that posh bird who gets everything wrong?
Yeah, she was fickle.
You crawler.
We do.
Yes. Your grandfather's stirred him up.
Is he?
Follow your impulse.
Oh aye, but I thought ...
Are you pulling my leg?
Gear?
Yes.
What are you?
I only enjoy acting for myself. I hate it when other people are let in.
Not really but I'm probably not a toffee maker. How would you do those lines of mine?
Have you no natural resources of your own? Have they even robbed you of that?
Yeah ... what's in it for me?
Shush! Have they roughed you up yet?
Keep your voice down, this lot'll paste you, just for the exercise. Oh they're a desperate crew of drippings and they've fists like matured hams for pounding defenceless lads like you.
And if they get you on the floor watch out for your brisket.
Eh?
You're left-handed, aren't you, Paul?
Why do you always use your left hand?
So's mine.
Please, can I have one to surge with?
I would though.
You're a swine. So hurry up ... we're travelling!
Oh you are, I know you are.
Oh you do, look.
Oh, leave off!!!
Don't exaggerate.
Don't worry about him. He can look after himself.
Well, you stick to that story, son.
Paul's grandfather.
Down the ... er ...
I know, that's the trouble.
Oh, him... He's been lurking.
A proper Aborigine.
Yeah, but he insisted on us bringing him to the station.
I feel like shit...
Do you remember the pyramid?
What's the terrain down there?
Well, line of sight is impossible due to dust.  Radar gives me noise. Sonar gives me noise.  Infrared -- noise.  Let's try ultraviolet.  There. Flat.  It's totally flat.  A plain.
Is it solid?
It's... basalt.  Rock.
Don't remember nothing.  Can't hardly remember my name.
God I'm hungry.
I don't know... I'm getting these <u>CRAMPS</u>!
I have intercepted a transmission of unknown origin.
A transmission?
A voice transmission.
Has the hull been breached?
Hard to say.
What do you mean?
You know what they make this stuff out of?
Don't know -- Broussard got hurt somehow.
Then why the hell are you sitting around here?
What?
Careful, don't get under it!
I'll come with you.
What do you mean?
Maybe we can catch it.
Still unconscious?
Whoever's doing the herding is gonna have their hands pretty full.  I think somebody should stay by the lifeboat to slam the door on the thing once it's inside, and to serve as... as... 
I've completely lost their signal.
I'm trying.
Just can that crap!  I'm in command here till Chaz returns!  And nobody's leaving this ship!
Our lives are more important. Anyway, we can take a small amount of the most valuable stuff with us on the lifeboat.
Maybe we should just wait a few more minutes.
Reminded me of when I was a kid and the roof leaked -- everybody running for the pots and pans.
We're going into the freezers now.
I was thinking of a line from an old poem: "Water, water everywhere, but not a drop to drink."  All that space out there, and we're trapped in this ship.
Come on -- let's go above and see how they're coming with the gear.
No -- that's atmosphere.  Cloud layer.
Zero.  Dry as a bone.
Found what?
We're coming up now, open the outer lock door.
Chaz -- what happened to Broussard?
I can't lean on Faust any harder -- he's been working non-stop on the engines.
You win.
Go ahead, Jay.
What do you think?  Now we go in.
Let's be democratic.
Right now let's keep it closed.
But the idea's good, if we could just turn it around somehow.
Now.  If we can get it into the boat, we won't have to blow it up -- we can just eject it into space.
Nah.  I just wanna squeeze off a few rounds.  'Sides, they tagged the rhinos for the migration project, so they're protected.  They'll dock you a month's pay for just mentioning it.
Oh man...
Seven minutes ago, the third course change in an hour.  Those incomings are going to skim past the communications platform just a little too close for comfort.
Ah, quit griping.  Keeps you in shape doesn't it?
That's a fact.
I've seen this mother, De Vries.  We can bag it, no problem.
What?
No, he's stopped; he's totally still. Just take it nice and easy, babe. Nice and easy...
Nah.  It's got programmable facilities, but it was never rigged for remote operation.  Someone'd have to go up to the cab to get it up and running.
How tight are these shafts?
And, nothing.  They checked out just fine.
How many... how many people are missing?
Okay, I pull the access panel off of the console.  Insert the disk, and press the green enabling button...
Four.
And before that?
What is this?  'Twenty Questions'?
First light, we'll take a chopper out there and tell them to head back.
Sure.  Do me good to stretch my legs.
Alright.  Pull some trackers and headsets out of stores, and I'll sign a release for the weapons.  Cassie, organise a team roster and put it on the board.
Don't wait for me!
A revolutionary approach to the Theater. However, if I may a suggestion...
We all come into this world with our little egos equipped with individual horns. If we don't blow them - who will?
Let's have a minimum of pretending. I'll want to do a column about you-
Yes. I do.
I discussed it very openly. I told her that I had spoken to Lloyd - and that he was interested.
Aren't you?
Paved with what, then?
You have no right to say such things!
Was the setting properly romantic - the lights on dimmers, gypsy violins off stage?
I'm sure you mean something by that, Addison, but I don't know what...
I can't believe my ears...
Belong - to you? That sound medieval - something out of an old melodrama...
Why do they always look like unhappy rabbits?
Then you've heard too.
You've heard of her great interest in the Theater-
Then you two must have a long talk-
Being violently ill to her tummy.
Didn't you know?
The implication being that I have not been reading them as written.
Huh?
This is Eve Harrington.
That's nice.
I don't want to be childish, I'd settle for just a few years-
And cut that out right now.
Bill? Have I gone crazy, Bill?
You're my girl, aren't you?
Cut it out.
Stop calling her a kid! It so happens there are particular aspects of my life to which I would like to maintain sole and exclusive rights and privileges!
What about her teeth? What about her fangs?
So full of meaning, fire and music!
Don't mix your metaphors.
I will not calm down!
I'm trying terribly hard.
Paranoiac!
That word again! I don't even know what it means...
Well, I am.
I wouldn't want you to marry me just to prove something.
I'll marry you if it turns out you have no blood at all.
I told you a lie. We'll make it easily. Margo's got no more conception of time than a halibut.
Just wondered what?
Why you have to go out there.
Is it the money?
Then why? Why, if you're the best and most successful young director in the Theater-
Yeah. They keep you under drugs out there with armed guards...
- and for you.
You're quite a girl.
You think?
A diamond collar, gold sleeves - you know, picture people...
If I haven't, I'll find something till you're normal.
See you home...
I couldn't get into the girdle in two an' a half hours...
Behind in your dues? How much?
Now you want an argument.
She works hard.
Late for what?
Well, I certainly think it's odd he hasn't even come up...
How did you get in here?
That spilled drink is going to ruin your carper.
Why should you be? After all, six nights a week - for weeks - of watching even Margo Channing enter and leave a theater-
Try...
Why shouldn't you?  Please sit down.
No! I don't expect you to believe anything. Except that the responsibility is mine. And the disgrace.
Well. I think you're painting the picture a little darker than it is, really. If nothing else - and don't underestimate him - you have a powerful friend in Addison.
I'd do much more - for a part that good.
Farmers were poor in those days, that's what dad was - a farmer. I had to help out. So I quit school and I went to Milwaukee. I became a secretary. In a brewery.  When you're a secretary in a brewery - it's pretty hard to make believe you're anything else. Everything is beer. It wasn't much fun, but it helped at home -  and there was a Little Theater Group... like a drop of rain in the desert. That's where I met Eddie. He was a radio technician. We played 'Liliom' for three performances, I was awful - then the war came, and we got married. Eddie was in the air force - and they sent him to the South Pacific. You were with the O.W.I., weren't you Mr. Richards?  That's what 'Who's Who' says... well, with Eddie gone, my life went back to beer. Except for a letter a week. One week Eddie wrote he had a leave coming up. I'd saved my money and vacation time. I went to San Francisco to meet him.  Eddie wasn't there. They forwarded the telegram from Milwaukee - the one that came from Washington to say that Eddie wasn't coming at all. That Eddie was dead...  ... so I figured I'd stay in San Francisco. i was alone, but couldn't go back without Eddie. I found a job. And his insurance helped... and there were theaters in San Francisco. And one night Margo Channing came to play in 'Remembrance'... and I went to see it. And - well - here I am...
I've got it.
It seems I can't think of a thing you haven't thought of...
Well, I was sure you'd want to, of course, being his birthday, and you've been so busy these past few days, and last night I meant to tell you before you went out with the Richards - and I guess I was asleep when you got home...
I wouldn't like.
Of all people you should know what it means to want some peace and quiet-
Not many car either, not much chance of a lift...
You're Margo. Just - Margo.
Those years stretch as the years go on. I've seen it happen too often.
Isn't that what they always say?
Lloyd says it's a publicity release...
Easy, now...
Margo, again...
Five-fifty-five. We'll be at the station in plenty of time...
Eve.
She's been to see me, as a matter of fact she left just before you came in - you just missed her...
That was a pity...
She wanted to explain about her interview, wanted to apologize to someone - and didn't dare face Margo...
If we could cast it properly, that is...
Margo in the Cub Room. I couldn't be more surprised if she'd said Grant's Tomb.
I'm glad Bill's back.
Such as?
Not exactly. Sometimes, though, I wish I understood you better.
When you do, let me in on it.
"Cora." She's - still a girl of twenty?
Week after week, to thousands of people, you're as young as you want...
I thought you knew... She was put on over a week ago-
I have no intention of having an accident!
It this Templeton 89970? Miss Margo Channing?
I placed...?
I just played it.
Margo, I wouldn't think of taking that girl away from you...
Promise.
I didn't hear you.
--it was fine the way it was--
Yeah?
I was sure trying.
--a spy, you mean?
We need a sympathetic face.
Were you eyebrow reading?
It was there. I just don't get it; a CREEP secretary being scared, that's one thing. But what does the wife of one of the most powerful men in America have to be afraid of...?
My first day as a copy boy I was sixteen and wearing my only grown-up suit--it was cream colored. At 2:30 the head copy boy comes running up to me and says, "My God, haven't you washed the carbon paper yet? If it's not washed by three, it'll never by dry for tomorrow."  And I said, "Am I supposed to do that?" and he said, "Absolutely, it's crucial." So I run around and grab all the carbon paper from all the desks and take it to the men's room. I'm standing there washing it and it's splashing all over me and the editor comes in to take a leak, and he says, "What the fuck do you think you're doing?" And I said, "It's 2:30. I'm washing the carbon paper."  Just wanted you to know I've done dumber things than get us lost, that's all.
And I'm a Republican.
Sure.
You voted for him.
Then tomorrow's grand jury indictments will just be bullshit.
--has he got an ax?--
--for the first time I'm beginning to feel like a fucking reporter-- Woodward, I got a tip. A guy called me up with a tip--  --someone named Donald Segretti contacted a bunch of lawyers and asked them if they'd like to go to work with him screwing up the Democrats, dirty tricks, shit like that. The FBI knows about Segretti-- Howard Hunt made a bunch of phone calls to him--they interrogated him, but on account of Segretti wasn't involved with the break-in, they didn't follow through. But Segretti did a lot of traveling--he called these lawyers from different places, and he told them the Republicans knew what he was doing.
Segovia begged me for me secret but I said, "No, Andres, you'll have to try and make it without me."
--jeeeeeeesus--
I'm on deadline.
Whatever.
--Howard Hunt?
Sure. I remember seeing a book about Chappaquiddick on his desk and he was always getting material out of the White House Library and the Library of Congress and--
You wrote the Canuck letter--the one where you claimed Muskie slurred the Canadians.
When you guys print it in the paper, then I'll know.  I'm a lawyer, and I'll probably go to jail, and be disbarred, and what did I do that was so awful?
Sure--off the record.
Can't help you.
We've just been talking to Young--
--what?--
--there's nothing new in it--
I could care less about where it happened; what happened is what counts.  Put him on.  Ken, I'm sorry, it was Goddamn Beirut and they were having a crisis, what's up, kid?  Slow down, Ken, you sound frazzled.  A wife and a family and a cat and a dog, right, Ken.  Ken, I would never print that you were in Marilyn's apartment at night-- unless, of course, you force me to.
Just let me get a match.
Which people?
The ones who could disburse the money.
It was all so crazy--the day after the break-in he gave us a speech, bouncing up and down on his heels in that loony way of his--Gordon told us not to let Jim McCord ruin everything--don't let one bad apple spoil the barrel, he said. You just know that when Gordon Liddy's calling someone a bad apple, something's wrong somewhere.  ...It's all so rotten... and getting worse... and all I care about is Hugh Sloan. His wife was going to leave him if he didn't stand up and do what was right. And he quit. He quit because he saw it and didn't want any part of it.
What do you want to know?
I will not talk about the other two.
My non-denial denial.
It's not that we're using unnamed sources that bothers me, or that everything we print the White House denies, or that almost no other papers are reprinting our stuff.
He approved the payments to Liddy while he was still Attorney General--
--his dialing finger must be falling off--
--I'm not sure, it still feels thin-- 
Mitchell started the cover-up early, everyone is involved in the cover- up, all the way to the top. The whole U.S. intelligence community is mixed in with the covert activities. The extent of it is incredible.  And people's lives are in danger, maybe including ours.
I assure you, there's nothing mysterious involved.
It was really nice of you to come, since you'd only met him once.
Are you implying you don't believe me?
I'm a proper citizen, I'm a decent man, I don't do anything that isn't decent or proper.  I know I shouldn't tell you this...
I was being cautious.  You can safely say more then fifty...
We know that--and if we were wrong, we're resigning--were we wrong?
Where?
Are you sure?
--well, what if your boys get it wrong--
As usual, that keen mind of yours has pegged the situation perfectly.  Except  it wasn't local Democratic Headquarters, it was National Democratic Headquarters--  --and  these weren't just any idiots, these were special idiots, seeing as when they were arrested at 2:30 this morning, they were all wearing business suits and Playtex gloves and were carrying--  --a walkie-talkie, forty rolls of film, cameras, lock picks, pen-sized tear gas guns, plus various bugging devices.  Not to mention over two thousand dollars, mostly in sequenced hundred dollar bills.
The most powerful man in America is President Nixon, probably you've heard his name.
--well, Sloan--
You think she wants us to ease up on the story?
He just did.
Well, when Liddy came and asked for money for what turned out to be the break-in funds, I went to the safe and gave him--out of this whole fortune--I happened to give him the same hundreds he gave me--banks have to keep track of hundreds. If the money had been in fifties, or if I'd grabbed a different stack, there probably wouldn't have been any Watergate story.
No, I'm a reporter. I wanted to talk to you about the Committee to Re- Elect.
I'm not Miss Abbott.
Okay then.  The rest of you okay with that?
Thanks coach.
I'm not good in math.
Finch, you can be the one to date a nearly-dead insane chick.  Eat your damn imitation hot dog.
I'm so happy for you.  Takes the edge off, doesn't it?  And where might your date be?
You'll see.  Gotta go.  Sixteen minute round trip.
Seduce her.
Yeah.  Right, uh-huh.  I feel like I've discovered this whole new side of me.  Music is so expressive.
You can call me Ostreicher.
I wasn't making fun of you.
Give me a break, you're so full of it.
How did you know I was here?
So you're going to Michigan?
Well, that's what your friends call you.  I mean...I feel like I'm one of your friends now...and also...your girlfriend.
Jessica!  He'll drive there for me, and I'll drive to Ann Arbor for him. We're going to have sex when he's ready and I'm ready.  It's got to be completely perfect.  I want the right place, the right time, the right moment.
Please.
I think I've had one.
Well that's a no.  No wonder you're not psyched about sex.  You've never even had one manually?
Do you love her?
Well, if you want to get her in the sack, tell her you love her.  That's how I was duped.
I don't want to dupe her, Jessica.  If I say it, I have to be sure I mean it.
Finch, you got the Latin homework?
But --
Right.  That gives us...
No -- it's true.  He is...really... big.
Holy shit!
It's not what it looks like!
Highly, highly overrated.
Okay.  You want a story?  Here's a story.  Stifler finds this beer, right?  And...
I told you.
Well, I do have ballet practice. Perhaps I can come by your house afterwards.  I can change clothes at your place?
Shame on you!
Yes...James, it is knowing that these beautiful women arouse you that arouses me...
Oh yes.  Very arousing women.  They arouse me very much.  But not as arousing as you.
Oh no, Stifler, what did you do?
Me?  Nothing.  I'm the one whose ass he kicked.  I'll tell you one thing, though.  I don't think he's gonna have a problem shitting in school anymore.
You think so?
Tonight?
Okay, don't stop.
How?
It's like a six or seven hour drive. That's easy, I don't mind driving.
Wow, Kev...it's perfect.
Yeah.
Your little pact.  Jessica told me all about it.  Way to go, Kev!
Fuck yeah we will.
Dude, he does not.
No thanks, you've been singing that shit all week.  If you try that at MSU this Saturday, I'm pretending I don't know you.
Oh sure, it was all mean old Marcel's idea. Give me a break! We didn't tell you because it's a wild goose chase! Not to mention disgusting. Look...
But you better hurry.
Uh huh... And, supposing I believed that, what could I do about it?
Uh-huh. Good for you.
Serafine...?
It's okay. I can see fine.
Man! Our first date and already you're trying to get me to change! You French women work quick!
That's what counts. If you're not passionate about it, don't waste your time. That's why I quit college... Plus I'm a lazy bastard.  Wait, I know this... A votre sante.
Listen, I'm coming over. Don't go anywhere. Stay right there.
I had to be a damn Hemingway hero. Well I'll tell ya, the old man and the sea didn't go through half this shit.
I told you. He already tried to contact me once. If you saw his face... He was desperate to tell me something. I owe him this.
It's making me hungry.
Andy...
Man, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
If you know about the church, why ask such stupid questions?
I know. I'm Andy McDermott. Terrence's nephew.
The cops. It's their backward laws that force all this underground in the first place, endangering people whose only crime is pushing the limits of perception, exploring new states of psychic awareness.
I told him it wasn't ready...
Yeah. Look, uncle Terrence -
Not too well. He taught at the Sorbonne, right? Dad always calls him his "hippie brother". Did some work with Timothy Leary I think, and - Is he... is he going to die?
No we can't. That's the problem. God knows it would beat hanging around with you!
Puking on yourself in midair is not a good death.
It's where I've made my home but I do have something for you . . .
You must have.
Come out! I can do alterations.
Cut it out, Vlad! I'm not angry with you anymore - I know how much you needed the money.
I'm sorry. . .  I'm. . .
You know, it's strange - Anastasia's grandmother, the Dowager Empress Tatiana has been looking for Anastasia since the revolution.  Why do you think she wouldn't go to her own grandmother?
I don't know.  I don't see what this has to do with me.
Sorry - it's a reflex. Living in an orphanage if someone bothers you - you automatically come up swinging.
The dessert fork!
It's not you - it's the dress!
I know I must have had something to do with the palace - I've had little flashes of things - but being the Princess? It doesn't matter as long as I find my home.
I'm sorry.
THINGS MY HEAR USED TO KNOW THINGS IT YEARS TO REMEMBER
I don't know who I am! I still don't know!
You'd lose your security deposit?
Oy... not a road trip. I get wagon sick, you know that.
She leads a charmed life, that little one ... Someone is always there to save her. In the palace as a child, on the train and now ... it's him.
Pray he's color-blind...
What do you mean?
Run, Anya -  go...
How much pain will you inflict on an old woman for money?!
Despite being shot, poisoned and thrown into an icy river . . . YES!
I had nothing to do with it!
Then, you'll take her to see Tatiana?
Perhaps you could convince her?
No. Yeah, once in a while. You know, like occasionally.
This guy's on television! Alvy Singer, right? Am I right?
All the good meetings are taken.
No, because they're-they're laughing, so  I-I-I'd rather not. If you don't mind, I prefer-
Alvy.
You're gonna hafta learn to deal with it.
Deal! I'm dealing with two guys named Cheech!
Hey, you are in a bad mood. You-you- you must be getting your period.
I'm not getting my period. Jesus, every time anything out of the ordinary happens, you think that I'm getting my period!
You wanna get coffee for two hours or something? We'll go next-
Well, stop listening to him.
Well, he's spitting on my neck! You know, he's spitting on my neck when he talks.
What-what-what-what's the matter?
Hey, that was last year.
Well, I do commercials, sort of...
Wisconsin.
Okay, that's good.
You sure?
No, I got time.
Fifteen years?
M'hm...
Oh... oh, well, you see now now, uh, that's my dad, that's Father-and that's my... brother, Duane.
Oh, really? Oh, well... uh, uh, maybe, uh, maybe, we, uh...
Fifteen years, huh?
Yeah, well... you- She hates Jews. She thinks that they just make money, but let me tell yuh, I mean, she's the one yeah, is she ever. I'm tellin' yuh.
Gee, boy, what do you have? You have plague?
It's terrific.
Yeah, you know something? I never even took a lesson, either.
Okay. Yeah.
My first... Yes, she was nice, but you know, uh, it was my fault. I was just... I was too crazy.
As Balzac said...
Yeah.
Yeah?
Yeah, 'cause I-I'm, you know, I'm, I'm obsessed with-with, uh, with death, I think. Big-
Those are the two categories...
U-huh.
Oh, that's hilarious. They're back from Fire Island. They're... they're sort of giving it a chance-you know what I mean?
Oh! Italian, right?
Yeah, I know it's small.
No-what, what...? I... we live together, we sleep together, we eat together. Jesus, you don't want it to be like we're married, do yuh?
Me, no. You... I-I-you know, if I have grass or alcohol or anything I get unbearably wonderful. I get too, too wonderful for words. You know, I don't-I don't know why you have to, uh, get high every time we make love.
Well, I'll give you a shot of sodium pentothal. You can sleep through it.
Oh, come on, look who's talking. You've been seeing a psychiatrist for fifteen years.  You should smoke some o' this. You'd be off the couch in no time.
Oh, no, Alvy, please. Alvy, please.  M'mrnm.
Is it my imagination or are you just going through the motions?
Oh, I'm really, uh, looking forward to tomorrow. I mean, you know, I think that it'll be really nice to meet Mother and Father.
Yeah-well, I didn't start out spying. I-I thought I'd surprise yuh. Pick you up after school.
We're not having an affair. He's married. He just happens to think I'm neat.
Me? I'm-I'm one of the few males who suffers from that, so, so... you know.
M'hm.
Sinatra?
Yeah, and he's strangling me...
Will it change your wife?
I'm following you and David, if you-
My God, I mean, you know how I am about insects.
Kill it! For Go- What's wrong with you? Don't you have a can of Raid in the house?
Oh, yeah, really?  Really?  How-how'd you like it? Was it-was it, I mean, did it... was it heavy? Did it achieve total heavy-ocity? Or was it, uh...
Yeah, where is the spider?
Oh, I-I left it at your house.
Whatta-whatta yuh joining a minstrel show? Geez.  Don't worry!  I did it! I killed them both. What- what's the matter? Whatta you-  whatta you sad about? You- What'd you want me to do? Capture 'em and rehabilitate 'em?
Oh, I had the radio on.
Yeah?
I don't know.
Tsch, why don't we get... why don't we get Rob, and the three of us'll drive into Brooklyn, you know, and we show you the old neighborhood.
Yeah, but no presents till midnight.
Oh! My God! 
All right, all right, you don't wanna go to the party, so uh, whatta you wanna do?
Well, we never have any laughs anymore, is the problem.
I don't know, though, I feel so guilty because Alvy is paying for it, so, you know, so I do feel guilty if I don't go to bed with him. But if I do go to bed with him, it's like I'm going against my own feelings. I don't know I-I can't win.
Yeah, I know it's sick, but it's new. You know, you didn't say it couldn't be sick.
Well... H-h huh... Oh, good... Yes, I'll tell him.
There's no-no question in my mind. I think we're doing the mature thing, without any doubt.
This is the first book that I got you.
Thanks, honey.
Why? You wanna live out here all year? It's like living in Munchkin Land.
That's right, 'cause it's an important issue.
No.  Yes, of course I'm mad, because you love me, I know that.
Air miles, you know. I mean, you know what that does to my stomach?
Why are you so hostile?
You have a raccoon?
Oh, no, no, don't be... tsch... don't be silly. You know,  I'm startin' it-I'm startin' to get some feeling back in my jaw now.
Uh, oh, I don't know. It might have been Leopold and Loeb.  Hello. Oh, hi... Uh, no, what-what's the matter? What-what-what? You sound terrible... No, what- Sure I- Whatta yuh what kind of an emergency?... No, well, stay there. Stay there, I'll come over right now. I'll come over right now.  Just stay there, I'll come right over.
without getting... well, let's put it this way...
It's a narrow view.
This is, uh, Shawn, and, uh... Bob and Petronia.
Right before his un-American thing.
Yeah, I love it there.
Just give me the license, please.
Right, Max. California, Max.
Ah.
We move to sunny L.A. All of show business is out there, Max.
I don't know, I mean, I-
M'hm.
Yeah, you're used to the kind with the- with the shopping bags walking through Central Park with the surgical masks on muttering.
Uri Geller must be on the premises someplace.
His wife has diabetes!
I look pretty.
Hey, listen-I mean, he was a terrific actor, and look at him, he's neat- looking and he was emotional... Y- hey, I don't think you like emotion too much.
Lotta beautiful women. It was fun to flirt.
No, no, no, not at all.
No, I don't-I don't know, but I-I know your work. I'm a big fan of yours.
Maybe if you're on the Coast, we'll get together and... and we'll meet there.
I really enjoyed it.  Nice to have metcha. Good night.
I don't know. I don't know.
Oh yes.
To code?
Why last?
Yeah, I know... But she's only twenty seven and...  The wisdom.  She's an old soul.  She knew that Shostakovich thing.  Did you notice?
Absolutely.  And she's got great tits.
No, what?
Who, Sally?
Mac's a pretty great director, Joe.  He's a woman's director.  And nothing's happening.  Course he won't fire her, because of the friendship... But it was discussed.  He had to battle his studio to get her in the first place.
Hey, listen, I love her.  She's Sophia's best friend.  I never said any of this, alright.  I'll deny it on the stand...  You guys are gonna have kids.  That is so great.  Maybe that's what this is all about.  Maybe she doesn't want to do this anymore.  You know adults don't do this for a living.  You guys are gonna have your kids, you'll be directing -- one asshole in the family is enough.  Sophia knew that intuitively.  Look at Clair. Clair's a mess.  Make sure she gets the epidural.  Forget that natural childbirth shit. Everything's going to be what it's supposed to be.  "Life is but a walking shadow.  A poor player who struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more..." And speaking of me, the role of Leo in your film?
Leo?
Scratch the two, write in a four.
Five years ago, I was at the party, remember?
It's always not this time.  If you can do it around me, you can do it around anyone.
You're coming swimming in the pool, and in a few minutes you won't even remember what it's about.  You won't care who's in your damn movie.
What what's about?
Whatever you like.  I'm afraid it'll all be too big for you.  Are you alright, Clair?
Just don't fucking tell her.
I'm glad that's all over for me.
Dander.  He's allergic.  Otis.
I love her too, Joe.
Count on it.
I should have damn well bought it.  Well, we can't afford it.  The movie's going to eat up a year of my life and I'm getting paid next to nothing.  Do you know how much Skye Davidson's getting?  Four million.
Escape hatch.  And Dad was having a go about the garden.  Something was misplanted...
You have?
Are you my big hard hero?
Do you want me to save you?  Do you want me to save you?
Oh yeah...
Oh yeah?
Damn near.  And a damn near perfect drug.
Yeah, thanks pal.
I adore him.
Hardly...
Accept a compliment.
What?
No, no of course not.  It's Skye fucking Davidson, for fuck's sake.
Skye!  I'm so glad you're able to make it...it's our sixth, actually.  You read the book again?  Well, no, the ending to chapter six...it's just that it's not filmic. We tried it in an earlier draft, but, it just wasn't filmic... Well, sure, we can absolutely look at that again.  If you're coming from Laurel, you want to take Sunset west, we're just past Will Rogers State Park.  Three blocks west of that, you want to hang right.  It's about three quarters of a mile up a big white thing on the left.
Otis, good boy, come here.  Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
I don't look my age, Joe.
It's a shit novel anyway.
Not really.  I mean your books have always been pop, but this is the shallowest of the bunch.  That's what all our friends think, anyway.
Don't do this.
I'll never forgive you.
It's a Calder.
Still.  Well.  Let's drop it.
Mmm hmmm.
Ours.
You're an interior decorator, right?
Well, yes.  Yes, in fact.  A little on the outside, yes.  And there's been all this friction.
I don't know why, but these misunderstandings have a way of escalating.
But you're very private people.  You know, there's a kind of elitism...
Well, that's what Ryan thought.  I was more generous, actually.
I'm a little in the puke zone.
It's really not the same thing.  He was really nicer when he drank.
Sorry?
Not good.
God willing.
Oh?
Yes.
I did it.
I'm in the same room with Sally Nash.  Oh my God.  You're my icon.  I've been watching your films since I was a little girl.  Like, four years ago I followed you all around the Beverly Center - at least half a day, working up the courage to introduce myself.
Not at all.
Do you need anything else?
Andre Zhdanov?  How the hell do you know about Andre Zhdanov?
Exactly what I mean.  It's all ruined.
"How are you really doing, Panes?" "Lousy, thank you, I'm falling apart."
Okay.
"We can't stand seeing you like this, Panes.  I hate you being alone.  Why don't you stay with us for a while?" "I'd love to, thanks."
Yes.  Fine.
Well, something's wrong.
You don't need to thank me.
Well, so glad you decided to come.
You're keeping a record, are you?
Rose.
Whatever, do you remember?  I've seen all your movies.  When I was in rehab, the second time, they wouldn't even let us see your drug addict movie.  They said you were too real.  I worship you.  And I couldn't be more flattered, because I know the part I'm playing in Joe's movie is based on you as a young woman.
Relax.  You've done enough.
And she was saying how happy you were to finally have them over.  Because you're both, so, what - introspective?  And you should have done it ages ago.  I'm Sophia Gold.  Come meet my husband, Cal.
Like Joe.
Nevermind.
The both of you.
And the food sucks, I know.
Let's go in the kitchen and spy on everyone.
Cal knows who he is.  Did you notice how happy Joe was when the drugs came out tonight?
Well, you weren't fine last summer when you went Sylvia Plath on me in Connecticut.
Why are you doing this?
I'll make myself available...Listen, better watch out with the backtalk.  I don't know want you to end up like the guy who used to work next to me.  I'm afraid he got... <u>downsized</u>.
Z?  <u>Our</u> Z?  The little guy made it!
Invisible!
I CAN'T DANCE WITH A WORKER!
Quiet -- sshhh!!
Oh come on, <u>you're</u> the one who came after me -- the swarthy, earthy, sensual worker!
Hlllllllp!
So what makes you so special?
Let's dig in!
I'm the Princess, aren't I?
And do Princesses do improper things?
Of course not --
Don't make my mistake, kid... don't...be a grunt...your whole life...
Dammit, I'm proud to be an ant.  And I know each and every one of you boys will do your duty.  Dismissed.
ONE TO NOTHING!
Negatory.  <u>Too many ants</u>.  And while we soldiers go out there, and fight, and bleed, and die for the colony, the namby-pamby workers live it up back home.
Oh, hey, that's great, I think I see an old war buddy over there, it's been fun chatting.  Good luck with the hallucinations.
Please don't worry, your majesty. Leave the worrying to me.  As you know, I'm not an ant of half- measures.  I don't pussyfoot around. This crisis is my number one priority, and I promise you it's being dealt with swiftly, and decisively.
Yeah, but you get to spend all day with those fabulous worker babes.
Are you kidding?  There were sparks between us!  This scarf is a sign!
What's gonna go wrong?!  I take your place for the royal inspection.  Bala comes strolling down the line, she sees me -- <u>bingo</u>!  Love is rekindled, and she takes me up to the palace for a little...  tea and crumpets... and you take your place again, and go march around to your heart's content!
What do I do?
That's right.  Maria Ouspenskaya. BLONDE  Hiya, Ouspenskaya.
Care to make a small wager?
Really?  I was looking at some figures from the Sickness and Accident Claims Division -- do you know that the average New Yorker between the ages of twenty and fifty has two and a half colds a year?
I should have stayed in bed last night.
You may not realize it, Miss Kubelik, but I'm in the top ten -- efficiency-wise and this may be the day -- promotion-wise.
Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.  You know, you're the only one around here who ever takes his hat off in the elevator.
How'd you make out on the twenty- seventh floor?
This date -- is it just a date -- or is it something serious?
Oh, I understand.
What time does the show go on?
Well -- I could meet you at the theatre -- if that's all right.
Well, as a matter of fact, I was rather hurt when you stood me up that night --
Miss Kubelik, one doesn't get to be a second administrative assistant around here unless he's a pretty good judge of character -- and as far as I'm concerned, you're tops. I mean, decency-wise -- and otherwise-wise.  Cheers.
I'd better get back to my elevator. I don't want to be fired.
I don't understand --
Wait a minute -- let's talk this over first.  Just what are you going to tell her?
I'll tell her I spent the night with a friend.
Someone from the office.
They had to pump it out.
Sure.
Cut.
You better win a hand -- you're on a blitz.
As one woman to another -- I'm sure she'll understand --
Do I have to?
Gas.  Didn't you turn it on?
Thank you.
I guess so.
You did?
Anyway, I parked the car and loaded the gun -- well, you read in the papers all the time that people shoot themselves, but believe me, it's not that easy -- I mean, how do you do it? -- here, or here, or here --  -- you know where I finally shot myself?
I mean, after that?
You don't have to if you don't want to --
You mean, leaving his wife? Yeah. I'm very happy for you.
I guess so.
Seven --  -- queen.
All that marching -- tramp, tramp, tramp -- you were having army maneuvers maybe?
I was sort of wondering what you looked like. Sit down.
No, sir. I'm not going to deny it. But if you'd just let me explain --
You know how it is -- sooner or later they all give you a bad time.
And I've got good news for you, Baxter. All your troubles are over.
Yes, sir.
Don't mind what?
You know that other key to your apartment -- well, when we had that little scare about Miss Kubelik, I thought I'd better get rid of it quick -- so I threw it out the window of the commuter train.
That's right, Mr. Sheldrake. I won't be needing it -- because I'm all washed up around here.
Now hold on, Baxter --
Mr. Sheldrake?
I'll pay you on Friday.  And whatever happened to those little cheese crackers you used to have around?
Oh, yes, Mr. Dobisch.  I didn't recognize your voice --
Of course not.  But -- how can I be efficient in the office if I don't get enough sleep at night?
It's not Picasso I'm calling about. It's the key -- to my apartment -- you were supposed to leave it under the mat.
And I couldn't get into my apartment -- so at four a. m. I had to wake up the landlady and give her a whole song and dance about going out to mail a letter and the door slamming shut.
Thank you, Mr. Dobisch.
That's not like you, Baxter. Just the other day, at the staff meeting, I was telling Mr. Sheldrake what a reliable man you were.
Yeah.
Let me get my bag.
It was half-full -- about a dozen or so. You going to have to take her to the hospital?
Get that stuff out of her stomach -- if it isn't too late. You better put some coffee on -- and pray.
Miss Kubelik -- Fran.
Just as long as she's okay.
What's her address?  Where does she live?
Well, as a doctor, I guess I can't prove it wasn't an accident.  But as your neighbor, I'd like to kick your keester clear around the block.  Mind if I cool this off?
I don't know. All I know is I got to get out of this place.
Sorry to lose you, Baxter.
Happy New Year.
You know, that big-shot down in Cuba with the crazy beard.
That so.
Mickey? He wouldn't do nothing like that. He's a jockey. They caught him doping a horse.
A.W.O.L.?
Dreyfuss.
This is my brother-in-law, Karl Matuschka.
Yes, I know.
I don't know what you're talking about.
What for? You haven't done anything -- it's him -- what a salesman -- always the last booth in the Chinese restaurant -- and the same pitch about divorcing his wife -- and in the end you wind up with egg foo yong on your face.
I missed you, Fran.
I don't believe you.
Not very -- but I'm going to be there anyway.
We didn't talk about it -- you did.
Let's get something straight, Jeff -- I never asked you to leave your wife.
Is that what's been bothering you -- Miss Olsen? That's ancient history.
A hundred dollars? I wouldn't call that cheap. And you must be paying somebody something for the use of the apartment --
Baxter?
What guy?  Whose apartment is this, anyway?
What gives?
That's fine. But what are we going to do about grandma and Uncle Herman and Aunt Sophie and my two nieces --
Captain Willard -- go ahead.
We could use some fuel -- just a half drum -- just enough to get us out a here.
Get out --
Part.
Delta ?
Let's talk about you.
I was an FO for the 25th.
Fat. That's real fat.
How long were you up there ?
Call me what, sir?
That's right, sir -- I come from New Orleans -- I was raised to be a sauciere.. a great sauciere. We specialize in sauces; my whole family. It's what we do. I was supposed to go to Paris and study at the Escoffier School; I was saving the money. They called me for my physical so I figured the Navy had better food.
I know.
'Bout six months ago I took a man up to Lo Mung Bridge. He was regular Army too. Shot himself in the head. I brought his body back down.
All right I got a little surprise for you --
This is my crew and my fucking boat, and I'm the responsible party.
If they have boats ... or canoes... they'd get lost in the fog. We can't move either -- we'll end up on the shore.
Exactly -- you'll go up the Nung River in a Navy P.B.R. -- appear at Nu Mung Ba as if by accident, re-establish your acquintance with Colonel Kurtz, find out what's happened -- and why. Then terminate his command.
Yeah, it still runs.
What is it?
Charlie?
Well, he's killing now.
You can cut out the sir, Lance -- I'm Bill kilgore -- I'm a goofy foot.
Napalm, boy -- nothing else in the world smells like that --
Boss left.
Haven't got time, Hell's Angels -- lay it right up the tree line.
Haiphong? Shit, you jump in ?
No. Walked.
Nu Mung Ba. Last I heard, Walter Kurtz commanded a Green Beret detachment at Nu Mung Ba.
No -- no, sir.
Yeah, I like it...
Then let's get the hell out of here.
Which one's the Colonel's?
You think he'd of shot us?
Sure.
And you could just tell when the supplies were booby trapped?
Where's Kurtz? I want to talk to him.
Simple. They don't want him to go.
Kurtz. I tell you, that man has enlarged my mind.
We were going upriver when we got caught in a storm, ma'am.
I should be checking on the boat.
Kurtz.  I know you've heard of him.
That strange things.. terrible things have occured around this American, Kurtz.
Then Philippe will have to kill all of you.
What?
Mind if I get some stuff from my kit?
It'll be interesting, trying to build a fire without any wood.
168  CONTINUED:
Question is why they sat here when the storm moved in.  Check their stuff while I sniff around.
I was gone, in September, laying traplines.  She went to our cache for some meat.  Got mauled by a bear.  Tore open her skull. -more-
It's out by the pumping station, shot full of holes.
Sure did.  He was one of the trappers we rousted from the Haul Road.
You make it sound like a prison sentence.
It's exactly what you meant.
Do I want to be with you permanently?  Yes, I think I do. But be with what you do and the way you live?  That I don't know. C'mon, Eric, until I met you, coming back to Alaska was totally
My home is here.  With you.
Relax.  I just want to ask them how the hunting is.
Leave my traps.  We'll tag up, couple days.
You know Meyerling?
Too bad we're heading west.
Cowardly bastard.  I'm in handcuffs and I still scare the piss out of you.
The time has passed for men like them and me.  I know it.  But they're still fighting for survival, like cornered animals. That's why they'll kill you. -more-
Like I said, I'd still be up on that mountain, frozen solid, it wasn't for you.
What are you talking about?
-- Sam Wilder was my cousin. He's why I came to Alaska.  All his letters, saying what a paradise it is.  But me ending up dead won't do Sam a lick of good.
Some day these people'll wake up, and you'll be the first one they'll run out of here.
Corbett coming here stinks of trouble.  We should make the best of it before it turns around and bites us in the ass.
Dixie's waiting at the infirmary. She'll put a splint on that injured leg.
Ease off.  We do this my way.
They'll have to come right past us.
So shoot him.  Won't have to feed him that way --
Huh?
... moving in the wrong direction... Away from when I even remembered what it was like to have a man to... anything... hold fucking -- sorry -- hands with, for Christ's sake. I was feeling like really bad that Dr. Bettes is married.  Which is probably why I make poor Spencer hug me more than he wants to... Like the poor kid doesn't have enough problems. He has to make up for his mom not getting any.  Oh, boy. Who needs these thoughts?
Uh-huh.
Yes.
No. I asked. They said it's not covered under my plan. And it's not necessary anyway.
Once the tests come back, is there someone I can reach in your office for the results?
No.
It's not your table. It's the place's table. Behave. This once, you can sit at someone else's station.
No.
Well, not until now -- for Christ's sake.
It's okay -- I'll sit here.
You all set here?
How do you know about my mother?
How ya doing?
But you do have some idea how strange that sounds??? I'm worried that you did this because...
Yes. I'm going to give my queer neighbor a lift to Baltimore.
Okay.
No, sir...
No.
Yes.
Hello... Oh, my God, who did that to you?
Let me go in back. You look like you need all the room you can manage.
You like sad stories -- you want mine.
Dancing?
No...  ... I don't get this place. They make me buy an outfit but they let you wear a house dress. I don't get it.
Okay.
It's one idea...
It's your car but I don't want to hear it. If that means anything.
That seems like a good choice.
You don't have to answer everything I say. Just listen to me. Okay?
Is it a secret what you're doing here?
Melvin, even though it may seem that way now -- you don't know me all that well...  I'm not the answer for you.
No!!!
I'm filling in. We don't know if she's coming back. She might have to get a job closer to home.
You changed the room around...
Yes.  No.
Shhhh now. I like Simon. I like him enough to batter you unrecognizable if you verbally abuse him or so much as touch his dog again. Meanwhile, I'll try and think how you can make this up to him.  I hate doing this. I'm an art dealer.  Have a nice day. Party!
I did. And his stomach is out of whack. So they need him for a couple of days.
Concerned. I'm just the hall monitor here.
Last word freak.
See, he's right. I need the cards.  Simon, you're broke.
No! Would there be any way for you to be willing to walk his dog for him?
How come you're pretending to do cop work -- 'cause I don't think you could find your ass if you were spotted the hole.
Ask him.
We will if we can and if we can't, we'll come back and ask you again and again.
I got it. You're talking about your dog. I thought that was the name of the colored man I've been seeing in the hall.
Like thick molasses, with one of those wide noses perfect for smelling trouble and prison food...
How're you doing?
Do you realize that I work at him?
I called. I never touched you. I didn't leave my name or nothing.
Go away.
Please, just leave.
Get out.
Now we'll both call him.
This stuff is pointless.
Wouldn't your lie be a lot easier if you were not...
... so Mom. Truly no grudges -- truly. A little odd that you didn't come to see me when you heard I was hurt, but the important thing I want you to know is your son is happy. I'm working again. I'll make do -- I don't want a thing. Wouldn't take it if it was offered. I'll drop you a note from wherever I land and then it's up to you. I hope we patch things up but know that if we don't, I wish you both the very best... I can't hear you. You heard me, though, right? Good -- take good care. 'Bye.
I'm going back with you.
Did you like it that much?
That somebody out there knows what it's like to be...  in here.
I think of a man and take away reason and accountability.
How about that pose?  This is not fun...  Give me some direction.
The fact that you haven't said, "hold it" means I haven't done it right...  is that correct? I haven't done it right?
Yes...  well, there's one more stage -- trying to figure out if it's any good.
Yeah, it's terrible.  I mean Valli, and I don't care what office he's running for, the guy's a crook.  He probably had it coming, but all the other people.  Real sad.
What's your name?  We both know it's not Nicholai.
Holy shit!  Robert Rath wants to know my name.
Two years.  Two long fucking years.
Yeah, that's it.  And he's like a fucking genius.  They said he shaded you over and over.  And in the end, he aced you again.  Shaded and faded.  They say he's living on some Greek island, but I say that's fucking bullshit.  I say you're the best and that you planted his ass. Am I right?
Oh, yeah.
You would be.
You don't know a fucking thing about me.  You don't have the slightest fucking clue.
I'm worried about you, Robert.
A new player.  He's using the name Nicholai.
Tomorrow.  The buyer is Japanese. His retirement a condition of the bonus.
Fuck you, fuck Cleveland, and fuck your contracts --
Another contractor.
Why?
This is something that is never going to end.  You can never work in the business again with this contract, because he will find you. To survive, you have to go into deep hiding.  And that's going to take money, a lot of money.
Right now, as we sit here, he is tearing through your apartment.  He is digging through your drawers, emptying your closets.  He will take your telephone and address books, your appointment books.  If you keep a diary, he is reading it.  He'll go into the kitchen and find out what kind of food you eat, liquor you drink, cigarettes you smoke.  In the bathroom he will find any prescription drugs you take and where you get them filled.  If you have video tape or recordings he will watch and listen to all of them.
What do you want to know?
How did you get into the business?
You went from high school to the Agency?
Because I want to know.
Did it ever bother you?
Did it ever bother James Bond?
I don't.
Why not?
Yes.
I don't know... But I'm sure he's not sleeping.
The beach?  It was nice.
Transmits and receives.
Cheap as shit.
No.  It would be amateur.  A risk. He'll wait for the prime shot, that he knows is coming.  Once I'm inside, he'll move to the hotel. He'll go up the back, too much traffic in the front.
We split the money?
Yes.
They're worth less points.
No.
No?
I'm sure you will.
No.  I tried to stop it.  I couldn't.
Maybe you should see a psychiatrist.
Why?
I'd love one.  Whatever you're having.
Are you asking me if I believe in another life?
I don't know.  Part of me wanted to but part of me always said, 'What's she going to be able to do?'  I don't know.  Maybe I didn't trust her.
I hope not.
And pay for their drinks occasionally.
Well, it's like I said, there's a ton of empty buildings around here and most of them were apparently given back to the city, so they're not private.... Now, Jahn here is an drama student at the University. He knows of a building that they were going to turn into a puppet theatre - they even began work on it, until they ran out of money.
Don't worry, I'll give you a hand as soon as I can.
Tough break.
No....The Asylum!
I don't know. This wall isn't like the rest though, it's not all that old either.
Just think though, it would make a hell of a cafe, that way we keep the auditorium clear.
Jesus Doug, they'll execute us!
You're all bloody useless.
Didn't I tell you, she dumped me Monday night.
What are you on about?
So I hear.
They ain't the only ones.
He got that one right.
Yeah. I tell you, they're one big happy family over there.
Well, the trial's in two weeks, but I think they've already sentenced me. They just need to check if Siberia can slot me in.
Some deal you did there!
We ain't going to give it away this time, are we?
Look, I don't care whether you go with Doug or not, but you_ve got to see him before he leaves.
Listen, Doug took the rap for us all so grab your coat 'cause you're going.
That one?
Your home address is 18 Thornton Avenue, Coventry.
They didn't look like medical files to me.
I've been around.
I could pencil you in if you like?
I'll take a rain-check for now.
Shhhhh, I'm concentrating!
How about you Brutus?
Everybody is at home, it's no good.
No Kat, I lied to you, I hate England and I don't ever want to live there again.
Sure, I've done it easily.
Yep, it's all yours.
That's only the half of it. I've heard a rumour they're taking over a theatre to use for alternative arts; you know what that means?
You can hold back this months pay-check until I come through with the story.
Insurance!
Well she sure isn't normal.
Thanks.
Guests.
Hmm, I still owe him.
Alright!
Oh shit, yeah. Can you lend some more money?
You will wish you hadn't.
Fuck you!
First, I want to walk free with a letter, in English, from the Prosecutor General dropping all charges. Second, I want two first class tickets to London leaving tonight and three thousand crowns in a stamped envelope. Lastly, all actions against the students are to be stopped!
The choice is yours, it's not negotiable.
Working....Under cover.
No way, he even gave me back pay.
Later.
Don't you dare, I'll be back!
Of course Darling, you'd like to apologise?
In a building belonging to the University in the Old Town.
I don't understand it, there were a lot of people there last night, many Americans, I believe we should move carefully.
You going to let him? You going to reward him by being the son he was never man enough to be a father to?
There's hot cider in the kitchen.
Me neither.
I could take after Dad, too.
That's eight years of school and training -- after college. And all that doesn't necessarily make you a better human being.
Landon, honey. There's nothing more.
I need to whizz.
What kind of a man are you, son?
I don't make small talk --
'They won't.'
-- This play means a lot to me.
So you agree you need help?
You want to tell me...
Ambitious.
Don't bother!
That is my telescope.
My relationship with God is my own.
But you think about Him -- It -- Her.
You don't miss a thing.
Belinda's a very jealous person.
No.  But are you -- impressed?
Why not?
Fun.
Twice a year.
Yes. I try to keep my power.
Yes, one of many.
That I want you to take me home.
Landon. I can't even do for myself.
I thought we had rid ourselves of his disagreeable companionship.
I have expectations, too.
No. I want what's best for you.
I was wrong. Nobody could have wanted or loved your mother more than we did. Not even God.
She did. It was you.
I'm no dummy.
That's right.  The world is your oyster.
I want to come back.
I'm as underprivileged as they are --
I didn't say you did.
I beg your pardon?
This is 1952....?
That's good.
Well, I was on my way to school, and I just wanted to stop by and see if you were feeling okay.  You seemed like you were in pretty bad shape the other night.
School? I never thought of school! If I went to school I could blend in with everybody else, couldn't I?
No!
Learn anything?
Huh?
Nothing. Look, I'll write it down for you, okay?
Oh. Uh... 'Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!'  George paused. You really think I should swear?
Operator, what's today's date?
Shemp is right here in this room...two minutes from now, and at exactly 9:02PM, we'll catch up to him.
That's just great!
Curious... Very curious....
Nope. My father's never clenched a fist in his entire life!
No self confidence, I guess... At least you don't take after him.
Yeah... Jesus! I wonder how he ever got up enough nerve to marry my mom.
Running this place for a fella in town. Nothing much to speak of.
Yeah.
Listen, Holly, you want to take a walk with me?
He'll say that?
Yeah, but I don't like it.
No.
Don't ask me.
You said that once already... Too late now.
How's he doing?
Well, we'll see about that... Hey, lookie.
Anybody ever done that to you before?
Positive?
It was going too fast.
I could've pulled the car up on the tracks, slowed it down some.
Yeah, then we'd be stuck here.
Well. I'm not going to let that stop me.
Well, I'd like to leave a message, if that's okay.
Stay as long as you like.
Just thinking.
Fine.
Yes.
Nothing to apologize for, Casper.  You've gone beyond the call of duty tonight.  Mind if I get on the horn and radio the Cavaliers--?  They'll be worried.
Same one you had yesterday?
He went on a senseless crime spree, killed a cop during a bank robbery, got caught and judged insane.  The professor told us they threw away the key.
I look great.  Let's rock 'n' roll.
Where's the professor?
Whorfin?  Does he know we're coming?
And ask the American taxpayer to foot the bill?  No way.  Send 'em back to the Eighth Dimension as soon as we find the Overthruster.  It wasn't in Penny's purse...so if we have to run this joint upside down and inside out...
Go away.  Let me rot?
You.  Like the papers all say.
Adopted.  I should have know. Of course. If it was a snake, it'd bit me!
Yes, I do.  Gimme a chance.  I'm stronger than you think.
She was murdered by Hanoi Shan on our wedding night.
I gotta be honest with myself and not repress these feelings-I've got mixed emotions-I don't know if I can handle this.  Oh, boy...
That's just what you would say.  This is so unreal.  I'm dreaming...
Sure.  I won't hold my breath.
John Whorfin will kill us!
Damn John Whorfin--!
Nigh on ten years.  Been through a lotta scrapes together.
Bet you say that to all the girls, Perfect Tommy.
She's just a damn road hugger, Allison.  Plus the man can drive.
Please, Barton.
Barton. You see, Barton, I'm not just Bill's secretary – Bill and I are... I love. We-
What do you mean so to speak?! Audrey, how long have you been his... secretary?
Who is that?! Gaddamn voices come into the house... sons of bitches...
Hesh up! Be still now! DROWN 'EM! DROWN 'EM! DROWN –
I – I've got respect for – for working guys, like you –
All of us undomesticated writers eventually make their way out here to the Great Salt Lick. Mebbe that's why I allus have such a powerful thrust.
We need Indians for a Norman Steele western.
Well, to tell you the truth, I'm having some trouble getting started–
Understand shit! I though you were gonna consult another writer on this!
Bill Mayhew! Some help! The guy's a souse!
Well, that's a good question. Strange as it may seem, Charlie, I guess I write about people like you. The average working stiff. The common man.
And that's the point, that we all have stories. The hopes and dreams of the common man are as noble as those of any king. It's the stuff of life – why shouldn't it be the stuff of theater?  Goddamnit, why should that be a hard pill to swallow? Don't call it new theater, Charlie; call it real theater. Call it our theater.
Well, I don't mean to get up on my high horse, but why shouldn't we look at ourselves up there?  Who cares about the Fifth Earl of Bastrop and Lady Higginbottom and – and – and who killed Nigel Grinch-Gibbons?
I can feel my butt getting sore already.
Jesus, I hope I'm not interrupting you again. I heard you walking around in here.  Figured I'd drop by.
No... I guess it's something about my work. I get so worked up over it, I don't know; I don't really have a lot of attention left over, so it would be a little unfair...
Those two love-birds next door drivin' you nuts?
So they say.
Don't worry about it, Barton. We can sort it-
You gotta believe me –
But I didn't do it – don't you believe me?
Charlie! I've got no one else here! You're the only person I know in Los Angeles...
Yeah, but Charlie –
Well, keep it for me. Maybe it'll bring you good luck. Yeah, it'll help you finish your script. You'll think about me...
I hear it's Mundt. Madman Mundt.
Because you DON'T LISTEN!
Boy! You writers! Work hard, play hard!  That's what I hear, anyway...
Anyway, I had Lou read your script for me.
Kitchen closes at eight but I'm the night clerk. I can always ring out for sandwiches.
That's right, Fink, he lives next door to you.
Funny. As in, he likes to ventilate people with a shotgun and then cut their heads off.
No kidding, bright boy – we smelt Mundt all over this. Was he the idea man?
His name is Mundt. Karl Mundt.
He's a little funny in the head.
Ya see how he's not writing it down?
You didn't tell us you knew the dame.
Give you nose bleeds?
This man creates for a living! He puts food on your table and on mine! THANK him for it!  Thank him, you ungrateful sonofabitch! Thank him or YOU'RE fired!
Hell, I could take you through it step by step, explain why your story stinks, but I won't insult your intelligence. Well all right, first of all: This is a wrestling picture; the audience wants to see action, drama, wrestling, and plenty of it. They don't wanna see a guy wrestling with his soul – well, all right, a little bit, for the critics – but you make it the carrot that wags the dog. Too much of it and they head for exits and I don't blame 'em. There's plenty of poetry right inside that ring, Fink. Look at "Hell Ten Feet Square".
Thanks.
It's not gonna take long, Sam.
Things are fine.  I told you. They're fine.
No.
Thank you.
I thought you quit.
She didn't hand you to me.  She doesn't even know who you are. She told me about Lisa Henderson.
Yes.
I don't smoke.
I quit.
It won't last.
I felt somebody had read my book and was playing a game.
You know I don't like to wear any underwear, don't you, Nick?
They were drug buys.  I was a vice cop.
You want a name from the present? How about Hazel Dobkins?
She wiped out her whole family.
No.
My wife used to call me that.
I told her it was the fuck of the century.
No?
Why?
I would've paid more.  I wanted to know everything about you.  Then you came down here after Johnny got killed... it gave me a chance to get to know my character better.
I decided to give you one more chance.  I missed you.
I told you.  She kills him.
Did you ever tie him up?
He was murdered.
You make it up, but it has to be believable.  They call it suspension of disbelief.
.38 revolver.  Never recovered.
Nilsen?
They're executives.  They're nervous about everything.
No, sir.  They never even got a statement from her.
Nothin'  I'll be okay, pop.
Somethin', though.
Well, hell, son, it's got a certain ring to it, I'll say that.
You don't like punk rockers?
Say what?
Maybe it wasn't her that paid him. Maybe the money was for somethin' else.  How the fuck do I know? I'm just an old city cowboy tryin' not to fall outta his saddle.
Ain't that hard, son.  This young farmgirl, she got tired of all that attention goin' to her little brothers -- she fixed 'em.  Just like 'ole Hazel Dobkins fixed her whole family -- except young Roxy here, she didn't use a wedding present.  She used Daddy's razor.
If she's telling  you the truth.
I'm going with you.
He ain't that way.  He's got heart.
He looks a little shrunk, that's all.
She said she didn't know herself, just sort of did it on impulse.  The razor just happened to be there.
Come on, Phil.  You're not gonna let this slide.  What about her parents?  What about what else she's published?  At least we should get the stuff to see if we find anything else that's an amazing real-life coincidence.
What about me?
On what basis?
I'm Roxy.  I'm her -- friend.
It's always how you would do it. This is my version.
Do you ever get sick of it?
Of what?
The whole thing – painting.
You're asking me this because of the 'lapdog' remark. I read that. The person that wrote that has the compassion of a housefly. That's your enemy, not your audience. Your audience hasn't even been born yet. It's a lie that art is popular. The only thing popular about it is that it's written about in newspapers. I'm surprised when anybody comes to my openings. There're about ten people on the planet who know anything about painting, and Andy's one of them.
Ten bucks apiece.
My jacket? Gee, great...  Your show looks great. Quite a turnout. You look great. You kids. You drink red wine with fish. You can do anything! Make paintings in the basement of your gallery? First time I've heard of that!
My dog, Archie... I woke up with flea bites... Creepy. I ran out and bought flea collars. They work really well.
Do you still love her?
People are only interested in you because you're famous, not because they know a fuckin' thing about your work.
How much for these five?
You haven't been by lately.
Hi Dad. Hi Nora.
Decipher?
No, he said I was the Eddie Murphy of the art world. He said the Eddie Murphy.
Very well.
Why don't you try letting her in, Steve – I mean Shenge.
SAMO.
I am... On Gina.  Fuck – I didn't think we were actually gonna do this.
Hi Gina.
What's your fuckin' problem? You get a girlfriend and a little attention and then start acting all uppity with me.
Come on, let's get out of here.
Me fall? Let's get some drugs!
You don't have any fucking money..
Oahu, Lanai, Niihau, Kahoolawee –
Don't you think he's using you?
How is he?
Pretty much the same.
Would you check out my studio some time?
You like your dad's paintings?
No! I have a boyfriend. He loves me.
Fame. My liquid hijack Marlboros and the moon and the cow that jumped over it.
Yes, Boss.  If you're so smart, why are you here with me in this basement?
So shut up and keep painting..
I didn't know.
Pipe down, Lech. Let him order.
I'm here for an interrogation. You've been called a graffiti artist and I wanna know why. All I see are scribble scrabble abstractions!
That's ignorant.
It's vichyssoise, sir.
"Shreck's."  You --
I tried to grab you -- save you --
You're not the Mayor.
Things change.
Maybe you're right.
I'm listed.
"Vicki."  Ice-skater, or stewardess?
Sure.
If I said yes, then you might think me a Norman Bates, or a Ted Bundy type ... and then you might not let me kiss you.
Ah ... then you've come to the right lonely mansion.
Y'mean take off our costumes?
But a kiss can be even deadlier, if you mean ... it.
Scared of Oswald, are you?  Why, if his parents hadn't eighty- sixed him you two might've been roomies, at prep school!
Your blood, Max.
He <u>is</u> Batman, you moron.
All is shrill, all is blight...
But who could've ... no, don't say it.
Fred.  Fred?  He's ... actually he's been on an extended vacation, and --
I could teach her my "French flipper" trick...
Reclaim my birthright, y'mean?
Too good?
Actually I have to split.  Take a "personal day."  You don't mind? Max, you're tops.
Despite all your talents, you are still a novice in the ways of family. Dick follows the same ends as you but gets there by his own course.  You must learn to trust him.  For that is the nature of family.
Yes?
Remember this.  And remember it always.  I'm proud of you.  And I love you too, son.
Rather disappointed at how poorly I taught you proper housekeeping.  And quite well, it seems.  Thanks to you, son.  Thanks to you all.
Of course, Dick Grayson, ward of the fabulously wealthy Bruce Wayne. Why would you need a few hundred dollars?
I guess, the truth is I'm just not comfortable with the idle rich.  Even when they try to act like heroes.
Just don't tell me you're hoping to run away and join the circus.
I don't know.  It just feels right.
Bad, yes.  Guy, no.  This is one majorly beautiful evil person.
Umm-hmmmm.
We cut our support.  A conflict of ideologies.  Dr. Woodrue was a lunatic.
Maybe your witless playboy persona works on every bimbo du jour but I am not the least bit titillated by your attentions.  So back off or I'll have you in court quicker than you can spell sexual harassment.  Got me?
<		Maybe it's something in the water.
You left your back wide open.  Freeze could have killed you.
But he's never said a word-
Yes.  But Alfred's condition is less severe.  Freeze's research says he cured a case like Alfred's.  It just doesn't say how.
Dick, don't push me right now.
She's clouded your mind.  You're not thinking straight.
Oh but I am.  For the first time in a long time.  I'm through living in your shadow.  All that ends right now.
There was nothing I could do.  Batman deactivated her.  She's dead.
You lie!
That is far too merciful.  Batman will watch his beloved Gotham perish, then I will kill him.
One kiss, my love.  For luck.
You must show me your secrets, blossom, before I show you mine.
Without your research, I could never have come this far.  Join me.  The two of us, entwined, side by side...
Could I let Batman go? For Dick. For me. Could I leave the shadows? Have a life. Friends. Family...
Dr. Meridian...
As well as can be expected, I guess. Give me the bad news.
What?
...Afraid.
Precisely. So this number is probably some kind of calling card.
Claw Island. Nygma's headquarters. I'm sure that's where they're keeping Chase.  Are all the Batsuits destroyed?
Tonight's a good night.
Why's that?
Last night at the circus. I noticed something about Dent. His coin. He's obsessed with justice. It's his Achilles' heel. It can be exploited.
Try a fireman. Less to take off.
I don't mind the work. Pity I can't see behind the mask.
No more tricks, Edward. Release Chase and Dick. This is between you and me.
No. Don't leave me! My invention! I need you!
The press were just wondering what it feels like to be outsold, outclassed, and generally outdone in every way...  And what light through yonder window breaks? `Tis the east. And you are...
Banzai.
On occasion. Usually at night.
Exactly.
No insights here, doc. Just trying to get comfortable on your couch.  Oops. Times up.
I'd say this goes a little beyond taking your work home.
Rage. Anger. Passion. Pain.
Okay, tiger, take it slow. You going to give me your pin or something?
I always thought it was the bat that scared me that night that changed my life. But it wasn't. The real fear was hiding underneath: what I read in the journal, that my parents' deaths were my fault. That's what I couldn't remember. That's the crime I've been paying for all these years.
What are you talking about?
Save the sermons about how great you want my life to be, okay, Bruce? If it weren't for Batman my parents wouldn't be dead. You don't get it, do you? This is all your fault.
Bruce, you can't.
It's Dr. Meridian. Chase. Do you remember me?
Just call us Harvey. Can we get you a sandwich? A soft drink? Given all the trouble we caused you, how about we cut you in for a share of tonight's haul?
You're a genius.
You sunk my battleship.
Alexander Knox. Gotham Globe.
If you don't mind my asking... Who's close to you?
I had to save you, Vicki. I --  -- Please trust me.
Then stay away from Vicki. That's all I want, man. I just want your word.
Too much work.  I'm not really the physical type -- Thank you, Alfred.
God.  You would.  Come on, Bruce.  I just want to get two drinks in you.  As an experiment.
... Where are you calling from?
I've had an automatic tracer on this number ever since he tracked you to the museum.
Hang on. I have to leave a message.
We've told him we'll deal. What could he possible have to gain by --
Do you want this money or don't you?  Now shut up!  Shut up --
Very good idea, Jack.  In fact --  -- I'd like you to handle this operation personally.
Ten million dollars. Ten mi -- YOU CHEAPSKATES! I've just wiped out the stock market. I've cost you billions!  I want ten million and one.
Miss Vale, was it something I said?  Do you want to sniff my flower?
Small so far.  I think he's leaving the big fish for Harvey Dent.
Our next D.A. -- I hear Bruce Wayne is throwing a fundraiser.  Did you get your invitation yet?
Well, he must like the way he looks.  He's got a mirror in every room.
Allie, I know exactly why you're doing this.
Yeeees?
Yes.  Yes.  Sometime.
Your face smells like a foot.
Honestly David, you're so spineless.
Oh, right, yeah.  two dollars please.
Yes.  I'11 mention it to him.  But ... he's kind of his own guy, you know?
Isn't it?
Yes.  Ahm.  I was just wondering where my English house guest had got to.
on the other hand ... maybe a breath of fresh air is just what my family needs ... Yes.  Great news.  Fabulous.  Triumphant.  Course it might need a little smoothing over.  When's he due?
No. no, no, hold on ... We cant sustain our loses - so I've decided.. to sell Whistler's Mother.
I'm fired?  Because I let a... copy of a painting the get stolen?
Ah ... Jennifer, I need you to watch Kevin.  Jen?
Not my place, sir.  It would only be a matter of time before I'm calling you Dave.  Then where would we be?  By next year, you're my Sweety-Pie" and I'm "Coochie-Coo".  I'11 be back in 15.
Bye, Bean.  Thanks for everything. And take care, huh?  I know it's insane, but I'm going to miss you.
What?
This sucks.
Entert-ain...us...an-us...Oh yeah! Heh heh. Anus. Heh heh.
What's your problem Beavis?
Aggghg! We're gonna die! We're all gonna die!
And Boot-Head.
Heh heh. This is the best night of our lives.
Me first!
Huh huh. No way, dude.
Huh huh. We're gonna score now.
Yeah, heh heh. Damn right!
Whoa, this is cool! Heh heh. It's like, everything looks all weird and...
Okay. I'll go right after you.
Bunghole...
Whoa! heh heh. Hey Butt-Head, this chick is pretty cool. She says there's gonna be tons of sluts in Las Vegas! Heh heh heh.
Heh heh, thanks.
Why it's you two. How'd ya do in Vegas?
Sorry to hear that. Me, I took a beating.
Um, um, yeah, probably. Heh heh.
Yes. You can never be too careful Bork.
Oh, ah... You know that guy in whose camper they... I mean that guy off in whose camper they were whacking?
That's right. I'm offering you ten grand plus expenses to do my wife. We gotta deal?
She sure does.
Yup. Huh huh.
Uh, do you think these two sluts still live in Highland? That would be cool.
Helen got it for me in Oslo.
Adam!
Oh... I'm sorry...
How's your arm?
That's my girl!
They make gypsies look good.
Is this a punishment for something we did in life?  What can we do?
You can't say that for sure.  It could be a transitional thing. Like a post-life crisis.  We just have to be tougher with them. Come on.  Have some brandy. Spirits, get it?
She couldn't have.  We can't <u>make</u> them see us.
What about this Beetle guy?
... Yes this must be him.  Look... Betelgeuse... Betelgeuse...
I don't care, I've changed my mind.  ... I feel <u>really</u> confident.  We're getting better at this stuff.  We can scare them off ourselves -- tonight!  I've got an idea.  You're going to love it... I'm going to hate it.
But he didn't.  We've got him where we want him.
What makes you think she likes me?
3:30 I guess.
Is this like a trick question?
Stepmother.  I'm very sensitive about being related to reptiles.
Oh puh-leeze!
For Juno, your caseworker.  Not that it matters to your type.  But there <u>are</u> all these other people here ahead of you.  I'd say three hours.
But... the Deetzes are <u>destroying</u> our house.
The Intermediate Interface chapter on Haunting says it all.  Get 'em out yourself.  It's your house. Haunted houses don't come easy.
Hey <u>you've</u> been on Saturn!  I <u>hate</u> those sandworms!  <u>Yecchhh</u>! I've lost a lot of buddies to sandworms.  So a daughter?  She got good legs? God I love a young leg.
Home.  <u>Home</u>.  <u>Home</u>!
I always tell the truth.  Of course I can see you.
I want to be dead too.
'Bye, Jane, I'll see you in church in a couple weeks.
Where'd they go?
The happy hunting ground.  Who cares?
It means look <u>behind</u> you, bimbo.
That's it!
Just <u>say</u> it.
Yes.  Except when you creep around in your mother's --
Stepmother's...
Otho, could you actually... do something with them?
I'm sorry already.
You read my <u>mind</u>!  I love clients who can read my mind.  I don't think people realize how strong a connection there is between interior decoration and the supernatural.
Attic space.
Oh, they're still here.  They're Just not showing up.
Hold your breath and we'll pull.
But not for long...
However, with injuries such as this, I have run into minor hemorrhaging, which really isn't too serious at the time, but can cause secondary problems if not looked after.
I see.
Just to take the proper precautions, Mr. Gardiner, I'd recommend we take you downstairs and X-ray your leg.  ... By the way, Mr. Gardiner, I would like to ask you something straight out.
No, Robert.
Yes, Robert. I know about the President.
Yes. Ben called me. He wants me to meet the President.
Thank you, Robert.
Hell yes - walk. You're meeting the President, aren't you?
How true. Mr. Gardiner may be a welcome change of pace.
Fine. Thank you, Mr. Franklin.
And what do the boys around Intelligence think?
Morton Hull, the producer of 'This Evening' just called.
Your family doctor?
Oh. Well, they're just a wonderful couple, we've been friends for years. We visit their island quite often.
No. The Old Man died and Louise left.
Thank you, Eve - I like this house very much.
Was he a relative? Or an intimate friend?
Yes. I liked Louise very much. She was his maid.
Hello, Eve.
And Benjamin sends along his best wishes.
I know you do - you and your television...  ... Good luck, Chauncey.
The President is a nice person. I enjoyed it very much.
I think you should ask Mr. Rand that.
I'm glad you like it, Mr. Gardiner.
Yes, very well, thank you.
... Are you sure you like it?
Do you think so? Do you think so?
So you know Krylov!
Oh, good.
Yes, it is very good!
... I see.
Bravo!
I'm glad he came, Ben. It was nice talking to the President.
I understand.
Let me feel the strength in your hand, Chauncey... Let me feel your strength...  Yes, that's good... I hope, Chauncey - I hope that you'll stay with Eve... Take care of her, watch over her, she's a delicate flower, Chauncey...
Yes. I like to watch very much.
Of course, who can nowadays? I have trouble writing a post card to my children! Look, we could give you a six figure advance, provide you with the very best ghostwriter, research assistants, proof readers...
... Sir?
Yes.
Yes, I would like to see Ben.
Yes.
Oh. Thank you.
Yes.
I see.
Fine, then let's get started. The current state of our country is of vital interest to us all, and I would like to know if you agree with the President's view of the economy?
Yes. I was there with Ben.
How were you compensated for these duties you say you performed?
You have me, I am here. What more proof do you need?
I think you do, Mr. Chance. However, I will reiterate, this house is closed and you must leave...  Call me if you change your mind about signing.  C'mon, Sally - let's grab a bite...
... In the garden?
Sure, try again - where? There's nothing, it's like he never existed!
Oh, it wasn't all that bad, darling. We were fortunate that Mr. Gardiner turned out to be so reasonable.
Do you feel well enough for that?
Good evening, Wilson.
Chauncey, this is Mrs. Sophia Rowley.
It's not that, I just...
... Yeah...
Yes, Chauncey Gardiner.
No! He's a real gardener!
He does talk like one, but I think he's brilliant.
Sally Hayes is not a bitch - she's a damn fine attorney! I've got to talk to her about this Gardiner...
Quietly, please. Mr. Gardiner, for one, understands our language.
There is no information available on the man before he moved into Benjamin Rand's. It has proven to be such a difficult task that it has resulted in the loss of one of our agents to the United States Government.
And put it through on a Code Red - I want it as soon as possible.
Right, Chief.
This information goes back three days. I want the standard file, you know that.
Oh? What?
Mr. Gardiner...
Oh, I will, and I have many, many friends and associates, my friend. All, by the way, in Overeaters Anonymous. All of them fat and alone like me, all of them dream of being someone else, all of them with John Malkovich as their second choice!
Just an idea I had.
Nah. I'm not hungry. I'm sorry I didn't call. It was just, you know, hard to get away.
Oh, you know, not a lot. Just hanging around his apartment. I think he must be a lonely man.
What?
No they're not.
Us, of course.
We?
Well, you have the Maxine action figure to play with.
You fell in love with her first.
It's okay, Craig. It all worked out, in an odd sort of way.
I know.
This portal is mine and must be sealed up forever. For the love of God.
I'm sorry, I'm afraid I have no idea what you're saying right now.
No, it's okay, sir. Just a mixup with your secretary.
Glooph is not a letter, sir.
I'll keep that in mind, sir.
All right. Meet me at the Juicy-Juice Juice Bar after work today and I'll spill my goddamn guts for you.
Shall we say dinner on Friday. Just the two of us?  You can come too if you like, Schwartz.
No thank you sir. It's delicious, though. I just wanted to thank you for the opportunity to work at LesterCorp, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to tender my resignation effectively immediately.
No sir, not at all. It's just that I'm going to open my own business and...
And what sort of business will this be? If you don't mind my asking.
You're insane.
Yeah.
Great.  Buuuhhppaahhhhnnn. . . . . Muhhhahhhhh. . . . . ahhhnnnaaa. . nollltuuukkkaaaaralllll. . . tashabararassssssuuuuusaaaaaaa. . . nnnnnnnaaaaaannnnnnnnncccccceeeeeee Mwaaaaaa. . . . .Mahhhhhkkkkk. . . sssseeeeeen. Maxine?
Maxine.
Just.
You married?
Yeah. But enough about me.
Don’t let the girly shit fool you. It'd blow your shorts off.
You picked the unrequited variety. Very bad for the skin.
That's right, Wendy, it is against floor policy, but as long as you're here, let me tell you what I know about our cute little door friend. Many years ago, this very office was occupied by a kindly old watchmaker named Mr. White.
Long term psychic or physiological repercussions?
And as I said, sir, we can't very well exert physical persuasion upon the sacred vessel Malkovich.
Right, Lester. I heard you the first time. I'm not a dummy.
Didn't mean to imply that you were, sir.
Vegas? What'd you think?
No, a sexy dream. Of course, a scary dream.
But I think I have another plan.
Yeah yeah yeah. Yadda yadda yadda. Were you stoned?
Yes, but you see, someone else was talking through my mouth.
You followed your heart, my child, and that is not necessarily a bad thing.
No.
I understand, but we must protect the vessel at all costs.  Please, Craig, please step aside and allow us to have what is rightfully ours.
Maxine...
I thought so too, doll. I guess we were mistaken.
Broadway's finest three hours. It's about the suppression of the individual. Conformity as God in modern society.
Sounds boring. Are there any songs?
How'd you get this number?
Whatever you're having.
Oh, I'm really glad you called.
Oh, Lotte...
I'm getting better all the time.
No... damn... you...  Oh shut up, you overrated sack of shit.
You're right, my darling, it's so much more. It's playing with people!
Oh, Craiggy, that's brilliant!
I just had the most horrifying nightmare. The devil was in it.
Perhaps you'll want to consult that Ouija board again.
I see. Well, it is not my fault that thou art tiny. So if it is charity yer after, then be gone with ye, ye foul demon.
I am not asking for alms, but rather the ear of a kind man with a noble heart.
Folks come. Folks go.
Say the Word!
You saying whitefolks won. That what you saying?
I WILL PROTECT YOU.
YOUR FACE IS MINE.
I had another dream last night.  The dead man laying on top of me and I had nothing to eat. And the ghosts without skin stuck their fingers in me and said Beloved in the dark and bitch in the light..
You on your way home?
No. Not a bit all right. Hasn't gotten out of bed since that day.
I don't know. I think I've lost my mother, Paul D.
I heard your mother took sick, that so?
Yes ma'am.
I miss her.
That was fun.
She likes to see you off in the morning.
But mama..
She likes this dress...
What you want there? Somebody invite you in?
Yeah. Asked Rev. Pike if he could stay in the cellar.
Hold on! Don't jump if you can't see bottom!
You know she married Baby Suggs' boy.
And he left when he found out what Sethe did?  What you say casts a different light on it, I guess...I thought-
Children ain't gonna need to know that kind of thing.
What yard? When who-
Who is she? Where she come from?
Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?
Don't you die on me!! This is Baby Suggs quilt. Is that what you planning!?
Just, uh, just slip the rent under my door.
He looks like a fuckin' loser.
Yeah.  Jackie Treehorn wants to talk to the deadbeat Lebowski.
Huh.
Hey hey, I'm not messing with your special lady--
ANTI-SEMITE!
Yes.  I understand you're taking away the remains.
Yes sir.  It is our most modestly priced receptacle.
Your phone's ringing, Dude.
I got eighteen dollars, Dude.
So you have no frame of reference, Donny.  You're like a child who wanders in in the middle of a movie and wants to know--
What the fuck is he talking about?
No--
I've had a--
That's it!  Outta this fucking cab!
Lebowski on the right?
Far out.
And in fact he met privately with the President, though unfortunately there wasn't time for a photo opportunity.
Wonderful woman.  We were very--
Are these.
Different mothers, huh?
I see.
Green.  Some brown, or, uh, rust, coloration.
Far from it.
Wouldn't miss the semis.  How things been goin'?
Ahh, you know.  Strikes and gutters, ups and downs.
Sure.  Take it easy, Dude--I know that you will.
Uh-huh.  Well, I still jerk off manually.
But she hasn't run off, she's been--
Does the Pope shit in the woods?
Relax, man!  No physical harm intended!
Hey, relax man, I'm a brother shamus.
Listen, Maude, I'm sorry if your stepmother is a nympho, but I don't see what it has to do with--do you have any kalhua?
Take a look at this, sir.
He fixes the cable?
She most certainly was not!
Dieter Hauff?
Her "co-star" in the beaver picture?
Do you still have that doctor's number?
Bunch of assholes.  And then, you know, little of this, little of that. My career's, uh, slowed down a bit lately.
He thought I had your father's money, so he got me out of the way while he looked for it.
Larry Sellers, a high-school kid. Real fucking brat.
We did let Father run one of the companies, briefly, but he didn't do very well at it.
Huh...
This Chinaman who peed on my rug, I can't go give him a bill so what the fuck are you talking about?
He's fragile, man!  He's very fragile!
The man is a sex offender.  With a record.  Spent six months in Chino for exposing himself to an eight- year-old.
It is a fucking game.  You said so yourself, Dude--she kidnapped herself--
Huh?
What the fuck?
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?  What the fuck're we gonna tell Lebowski?
What the fuck're you talking about? That poor woman--that poor slut-- kidnapped herself, Dude.  You said so yourself--
"Our" car, Walter?
Nihilists!  Jesus.
Dude?
Dude!  Dude, I'm sorry!
--so, like I say, just thought, you know, fair warning.  Tell Walter.
Yeah?
Friends like these, huh Gary.
But I do work, so if you don't mind--
Huh?
Well, okay, if you've already made out the check.  Brandt is handing him a letter-sized envelope which is distended by something inside.
I said out.  Now.
Let me tell you something else. I've seen a lot of spinals, Dude, and this guy is a fake.  A fucking goldbricker.
Bullshit.  Eight, Dude.
Am I wrong!?
Survival.
Minutes.
Exactly.  Look at the digestive system. It's been drastically simplified.  Super charged.  And this --
I don't think so.
It doesn't have to be like that.  We don't have to be enemies.
Get real.  I was useful to Damaskinos as long as the hunt was still on.  Now that it's over, all bets are off.
What do you really think?
I should think that would be obvious at this point.
He was here.  Watching us.
Are you insane?  He'll kill us both!
Two so far.
No.  This is a dangerous game, you're playing, Damaskinos.
Our operation?!  Our operation?!  I built this operation, you fucking turd stain.
So how long have you known Blade, anyway?
Going on twenty years now.
Wait.
You sure now? I bled a newborn for this. You won't find a drink that's sweeter.
Take him.
Do it. You'll be dead before you can file the complaint.
You used me as bait?!
He didn't. Get over it.
Look closer.
There are worse things than vampires out there.
Cancer.
No --
Then what is it?
You're wasting your time, Frost. Far greater scholars than you have tried to decipher these words. Whatever secrets they hold have been lost.
Get away from him!
Then we're back to square one, aren't we? Sooner or later, the Thirst always wins.
Hey, folklore--
--doubtful, Mrs. Leavitt. The main thing to remember is, whatever the reason, it was for the best-- it meant something was wrong.
I guess--
Mrs. Leavitt--
Let's talk to your husband--
Christ.
Think again.
No idea, just talked to her on the 'Net--she's very good.
That's a joke?
I haven't killed any--
--or one huge attack of group hysteria.
--<u>whoever</u>--they built an entire house <u>around</u> a <u>tree</u>. Sticking up right through the living room. Somebody like to explain that to me?
And what do you possibly think you're going to fucking see there?
Sleep.
I see for proof positive you're the goddamn witch--
I know, I know.
--no one'll ever know.
No.
Who do you know who can? Where do we go?
--and unlike the first one, every second of it's gonna be true! "Blair Witch: The Real Story!"
Hey, Mr. Graduate Fucking Thesis here was s'posed to be driving!
So where the hell am I going to sleep?
If you're looking at me, look elsewhere.
Three people: two guys, a girl-- sleeping in the same motel room, the same tent night after night.
No.
What're you, nuts?
--coming out of the water--
Just go.
Su casa y shit-o hole-o.
Well, she got out of here <u>some</u>- how because she's not here!!
No idea--goddamitt!
Next time try putting on shoes--
--I saw what I saw.
The cart they brought Elly Kedward into the woods with--
Doesn't say--it's just these pages.
The wheel.
We're all going to be if you don't hit the brakes.
Right. And the check's in the mail.
--I dunno, I just woke up--
Maybe whatever they are, they just haven't appeared yet on her?
Ancient runes--
Two-to-one he dusts the keyboard for fingerprints the second he gets back.
No. Elly Kedward's not the problem here, I don't think. She was just a good old-fashioned white witch--
Go to the store. When you get back, I'll try to make sense of it for you.
--she wasn't a witch--we embrace nature, not evil--
She's off her fucking rocker--
She's far from "fine."
Could I tell him what it's regarding?
I'll tell your mother not to expect you at the funeral.
No.
You don't look too good. You sleep last night?
Where... where you going?
You're bad.
I didn't think I could sleep. I'm surprised you could. Are you all right?
You've got a very sophisticated palate.
Channels, we got two and six. Two don't come in so hot.
What's the matter?
I mean, I ain't a marriage counselor--
Fine. Suit yourself.  ...Having a good time?
Well what?
I didn't say that. All I said was you're an idiot. Hell, you been thinking about it so much it's driving you simple.
Ya catch any fish?
Got something to show me first?
Then you shouldn't have done it. Can't have it both ways.
Jack Daniels. Don't worry, I'm paying for it.
What's the point?
For what?
No, you do, cowboy. You been to the bar?
You we telling me about the Ring of Fire.
Tuesday is ladies' night.
You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice flight?
Well, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry about it. Look. I better go.
Shit. let's drink to something else. let's drink to fuckin'. Say here's to your fuck Frank.
Blue. It's Blue Velvet.
Okay. come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift.
I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs. and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and.  . and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. .I had to tell you about these things in case it could help.
Is Sandy part of this?
Oh my God. Is her son OK?
You want to see him too, right?
Shut up. Gimme your lipstick.  . Hey, pretty, pretty.
Alright, suit yourself.
Yeah.
I . I don't know.
What do you want?
Sure I'm alright. 
No.
What?
No.
No.
No. Please, Dorothy. Why are you in so much trouble?
Yes.
Do you want to do bad things?  Anything. anything.
What do you want?
Yes.
Does that scare you?
Shut up.
Come on Dorothy.
What if Frank came over here and found us?
Kiss me.
Just get outta my bed.
I'm glad you do.
No.  Hi baby.
HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!
We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though. you're okay. you shot a real son of a bitch.
I don't want to go.
Go where?
What?
Nothing.
Okay Frank.
What kinda beer do you like?
Just a minute. pull over and wait a minute.
Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. I will spray her apartment. After a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window.
Alright.
Oh bother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor.  Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.
Yeah. but.
Yeah?
So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.
Goodnight.
That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
... Sandy?.
uh uh.
Jeffrey, when you see your father.
Thanks a lot, Mom.
I mean. some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.
It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. real good.
Yeah.
... Stop it Mike.
Yes.  Jack Stevens is already a very busy man.  Along with many others.  You shouldn't stay away so long.
That's impossible.  We can't be up and running.  Who's distributing?
Thanks.  I am.  Where's Martha?
Mama, vos sos bien antigua.  Como lo va a matar con un picahielo.  Eso era en su tiempo, estamos casi ya en los ochenta. El lo va a meter un tiro, lo va a volar, le va a hechar un hijueputa carro encima.
Dejen la maricada pues!  No jodan! Nadie va a matar a nadie!  George, debemos hablarle al Patron, es la unica manera, mano.
What is?
You happy, baby?
We'll take it.
George, I went to the doctor.  I don't have two years.
My clothes, your clothes.  What does it matter?
I see.  How much?
Padrino will pay ten-thousand per kilo. For everyone.  For you, and you, and you.
Because if you are, you have to tell me. If not, it's entrapment.
No, no.  That is where you are wrong. For us, it is cheap.  In Medellin, we buy for six-thousand dollars a kilo.  IN Miami, we sell for sixty.
Jesus Christ.  Jesus fucking Christ.
I need you to go to Miami.
Then relax.  It's a federal bank. Guaranteed by the government.  And Senor Noriega has very lenient banking principles.  No questions.  No problems. All the pesados keep their money here. Even El Padrino.  What do you worry? Everyone knows we are with Escobar.  Who is going to fuck with us?
You're a lucky man, Diego.
What do you need my connection for, Diego?  What are you going to do with it?
What do I do with it?  Nothing.  It's for peace of mind.  It's for the principle.
Que es lo que quieren de me, hijueputas campesinos?
Es un Ford blanco junto a una pick-up.
Of course we are brothers.  Why do you say that?   You hurt me, George.
You went behind my back and you cut me out.
Today.
Thank you.  Have you been getting the money I sent you?
Un rata - no good.  But he could have run, fled the country.  Gone to the policia.  But then his wife, his children, his parents, his friends, many people would die.
Freedom.
Sure.
Beautiful girls?
And Diego?
You know why I'm here.  You know what I have to do.  I came here for permission. Out of respect, Pablo.  This is bullshit, he's making me look like a punk.
It is very difficult.  Diego makes me a lot of money.  If Diego goes so does the money.  You were an excellent teacher, George.  When the student has learned well, the teacher is no longer necessary.  We must remember we have wives, friends, familia.  Even familia that has not been born.  But sometimes, we must forget as well.  I am like you. I must teach the lesson.  We want to teach the lesson.  But we cannot.  We must remember that life is the teacher.
I get it.   I'm really pissed, Pablo. You know the DEA knows about Norman's Cay.  For Chrissakes, Diego worships Adolf Hitler and John Lennon, that's fucked up!
Of course, George.  We are beautiful. We are brothers.  Real brothers.  Not like Diego.  We started this, George.
I'm going to California.
Yeah, Dad.  I'm happy right now.
You know how we were wondering what we were going to do for money?  Being how we don't want to get jobs and whatnot? Well, check this out.
I don't think so.
Why are you smiling?
Fuck you, George, just fucking drive.
Are we gonna split up?
You know I can't.  Mom will never let me go.
You let me take care of your mother. You just pack your bags.
Swear on my life.
Who's the co-pilot?
You're looking at him.  We provide the plane, transportation cost, U.S. landing spot, and take it to wherever you want it to go.  You provide the pick up point in South America, and are responsible for payment.  You assume all the bust risks.  We take sixty-five percent of all transportation fees, ten percent of the gross, plus our expenses. This is not a negotiation, so if this is okay with you, we can talk further.  If not, we can forget we had this conversation.
They're over at the booth.
I don't need a little.  I need a lot.
Relax.  I've flown with my old man a million times.  And he always told me, the taking off part is easy, it's the landing you've got to worry about.
The strike is a success; but ...
It depends on you.
Let's try to be precise then. The word "torture" does not appear in our orders. We have always spoken of interrogation as the only valid method in a police operation directed against unknown enemies. As for the NLF, they request that their members, in the event of capture, should maintain silence for twenty-four hours, and then, they may talk. Thus, the organization has already had the time necessary to render useless any information furnished ... What type of interrogation should we choose? ... the one the courts use for a crime of homicide which drags on for months?
Second district ... Explain better ...
Uh ... responsible for the sixth section.
The NLF has condemned you to death.
What ... What must I decide?
Yes, but we must also show them that we still exist.
No, they'll do even more. We've given them the opportunity to do a lot more ... Do you understand what I mean? Starting tomorrow, they won't be groping in the dark any more; every shop and every worker who strikes will be a known enemy, a self-confessed criminal ... And they will be able to pass to the offensive. Have you thought of this?
For many months, I've had your photo on my desk together with a dozen or so reports on you ... And naturally, I am under the illusion that I know you somewhat. You never seemed the type, Kader, inclined to performing useless actions.
Because it hasn't all been erased.
What good does that do -- it's the old will?
Thanks, Mister D.
Not sure.  I'll have everything you need tomorrow.
A massive cardiac arrest.
Dr. McCurdy, what would cocaine do to someone in Mr. Marsh's condition?
It would be an added stress to his heart.
You name it -- they argued about it. Mr. Marsh tried his best to keep her happy -- but it seemed that no matter what he did it was never enough for her.
Did they argue the day before he died?
Your witness.
Why didn't the State's investigation uncover Mr. Roston earlier?
You may call your next witness.
Take your pole out of the water, Frank.  The fish ain't biting today.
Why would she want that?
Aren't they all?
Hey -- the bell's sounded.  It's between rounds.
Back off, John.
Did you use it the night Marsh died?
Six years.
Yes.
Did Mr. Marsh change his lifestyle after that?
Just one last question.  What does the sign on your office door say?
How would you describe your sex life with Miss Lawson?
And how are you now?
Why do you think she left you?
What would she do that made it hard to resist?
I couldn't help myself.  You get lost inside a women like her.  It was like a drug.  It was the best sex I ever had.
Did you change your will while you were with Miss Lawson?
Thank you.  The State rests.
Yes -- several times.
She said that those weren't any good -- because their use would be detected and the police would know the victim had been poisoned.  She wanted to know if there was a drug that would induce a heart attack but could also be used to enhance a sexual high.
No.
Yes.  I've been seeing her for over a year.
Chinese peony root.
Yes.
What about Miss Lawson?
What other kind of white powder do people keep in a vial?
Yes.  I suppose it's possible.
You don't like her because you were involved with Mr. Marsh before she came along.  Isn't that true?
Would you read for us the time of the purchase?
No!  Why would I want to kill him?
Because you were jealous.  Because he cut you out of the will.  Because you have a cocaine habit to feed -- because you know that if Rebecca Lawson is found guilty the new will is void -- and there's a very good chance the old one would be honored.
Frank -- what are you doing here?
I thought the subject was sex?
How?
I don't know if it's something I can explain to you.
Try.
Because, I'm your attorney.  I shouldn't be going to your house.
Is it against the law?
No -- it just doesn't look right.
I hardly know him.  He wanted me and he couldn't have me.
That seems so far away from who you are now.  What happened?
What?
She's mistaken.
I went out on the boat.
You're too weak, Frank.  When you want something you have to do what- ever it takes to get it.  If something gets in your way you remove it.
I'm not leaving without that tape.
Don't push me, Frank.  I might lose my temper and send it out just for spite.
I gotta go.  I'll call you later.
"Discourteous insinuations about his sexual abilities."  Who told you to say that?
Mr. Roston?
I am relaxing.
It's bad enough that you are.  It's even worse that you can stand here and lie to me.
You used to like to touch me -- to make love to me.
No, it's not.  Now I get to pitch.
What time did you leave?
I nearly died when we split the bill.
I said NO!
Aw, Betty.
I have some sandwich fixings if you're hungry.
Well, I don't care if it's legal or not, we're not cremating her and throwing her all over some bridge where we can't even go visit her because she's going to be blown all over the place like an ashtray.
That would be some trick. He's already dead. That's what this other letter is.  From his attorney. He left most of his things to mama and requested... 
Nice? He's trying to sleep with somebody's wife.
I don't think so. Not yet anyway. And besides, something like that doesn't make you a bad person. He reminds me of Steve in a way. Steve's weak, immoral and a liar but he's still a real nice guy. He just shouldn't be married.  At least not to me. You getting hungry? I'm hungry.
I never knew that.
Everything was during Betty. God we were so young. Why did we think we had to do it all so fast? I've never cheated on Betty. Not once we were married, I mean.
Did we want to?
-- for over twenty years because that's what I was taught -- you stick with it! Normal people don't get divorced. I can't remember the last time my husband made love to me so intensely that he transported me to Europe, for Christ's sake -- quite frankly, I don't think he ever did! And now I find out in between bake sales, my mother was Anais Nin!
You're right -- that is sick.
She changed.
Well, I didn't know they was a secret club.
Hmm-mmm.
That must be it. It's a great smell.
Oh. When did you move back?
Well, from Italy to Iowa -- that's a story!  Whereabouts in Italy?
I thought it was funny.
But I... We don't even know each other.
She starts sniffing me.
Then what happened?
You sound like an artist.
I don't think you're normal.
Do you miss it?
You're asking a man if he's too tired to talk about himself? You don't get out much, do you?
You want to go back in?
No. I'll do them later.
Not at all. I wasn't around much... So why did I get married? Well, I thought it was a good idea at the time. Have a home base. Roots. You can get lost moving around so much.
Never touch the stuff. I've got friends all over the world. Good friends I can see when I want, if I want.
No, I think I need everyone! I love people. I want to meet them all! I just think there are too many out there saying "This is mine." or "She's mine." Too many lines have been drawn. World's breaking apart because of man's weakness for some testosterone conquests over territory and power and people. He wants control over what deep down he knows he has no control over whatsoever and it scares him silly.
But -- how can you just live for what you want? What about other people?
I thought we were just having a conversation. You seem to be reading all this meaning into it. Meanings I must be too simple to, uh... interpret or something.
I'm sorry I didn't call sooner, but I just read your note. I stuffed it into my pocket. The light was fading and I had to get my shot.
The cashier at the general store was very dangerous.
I understand.  That's very kind of you.
No, I don't mind.
Trouble. Why?
Good. More coffee?  Robert, I hope you don't mind my asking, but I feel like I should.
I told you! I won't apologize for who I am.
I DON'T WANT TO NEED YOU!
His family's lived for almost a hundred years. Richard doesn't know how to live anywhere else. And the kids...
You've got to know deep down that the minute we leave here. It'll all change.
We are the choices we've made, Robert.
But now that you have it -
I want to keep it forever. I want to love you the way I do now the rest of my life. Don't you understand -- we'll lose it if we leave. I can't make an entire life disappear to start a new one. All I can do is try to hold onto to both. Help me. Help me not lose loving you.
No. Don't do this.
What about your husband?
Hmm?
Betty.
I don't remember!
They're not going to find her!
Well, that's crazy. I don't know anybody who gets cremated.
Why don't you hang on and I'll see if she's here.
I know damn well she's there.
Well, close the fucking door by all means.  But don't expect me to go down there and do it.
He yours, sir?
Yeah.  He lived there.  And died there, too.
Keep smokin', fool.
Just some flies.
Some flies?  I think this qualifies as way more than "some."
Let's get going.  Go home, pick up what we need, then crash here.
Or just Hell-adjacent...
You wouldn't know a mule if it bit you in the ass. And personally, I don't need a mule.  I got a Lexus.  And nobody gave it to me --
Ain't no big thang.  It's just a po' man's free base.  Here, check it out.
I said, no thanks.
Don't need luck tonight.  I'm just letting 'em have their say before I say no.
Must be my clothes line.  No?  How bout my phone line?
No baby.  I'm serious.  Cancel that meeting.  I got more fruit that needs checking.  Come home with me now.
Time like this, is that what you really want to know?  How I got the fuck in here?
You know I can't.
You got a vision, girl.  Just like I got. Just like my momma had.  And the good Lord didn't give you that vision just for painting pretty pictures.  That's just wasted time.
They seemed alright.  Bring a little life to that old building.
You said the vision, the images.  They're just that.  Just pictures.  They can't hurt you.  That's what you always said.
I lied.
Please.  It's for your own good.
My momma says every house is two houses. Every street, two streets.  There's a whole city, a whole world, kinda beside, on top, just below this one.  The city of the dead.
I can't!
You got the shit?
Like you always said, Pop, look for the undervalued.
I thought you'd be psyched.  Just trying to do what you did.  Take nothing and make something out of it.
I'm on my way home.  Can you handle it yourself?
Fuckin' comedian.  See you tomorrow.
We got a gift for you, Eddie.  Fresh new BMW.
Get that car the hell away from here, now!  I spend a lot of money to keep the cops cool.  But this is the kinda shit that pisses everybody off.
It was just like in my head.
Whattaya think?  Can you picture it? Over there the bar, and in here -- the dance floor.
"This is Patrick..."  "...And this is Patrick on crack." Imagination, my butt.  Even the space cowboy can't...
Save him?  What are you talking about?
We're all tired.  Everybody makes mistakes.  Tomorrow in the daylight, everything's gonna look different.
You hear that, bitch?  Be quiet!
Here, put this in his mouth.
I'll have whatever Violet's drinking.
All right!  Where's the key?
You aim a gun at me?!  Do you know who I am?!  I am Gino Marzzone.  You understand?
No!
Why?  'Cause you know him?
What are you, drunk?
I was getting out of the car when I saw him in the Mercedes.
Caesar, what are we going to do?
He didn't have that much time.  He had to pick up Gino.  I bet you he's got it with him.  I bet it's in the car.
They're just cops.  Stall them as long as you can.
Caesar, stop acting like an asshole and think --
Now you listen to me, asshole, I know your gun is behind the bar ...
Yes, I understand.
It's all right, sir.
Go right ahead, sir.
No.  Rajeev's in India.
My brushes, I have to clean my brushes.  Thanks, though.
Mickey, why is Johnnie here?  You know how I feel about that fucking psycho.
Caesar, you still got the money?
I thought I heard someone knocking.
I was buzzing, I was knocking, but I guess you couldn't hear me on account of being in the shower.
Sure, Cease.  They make us do stupid things, don't they.
This is the police, ma'am.
Rajeev, the man who usually works on the building.
No, it isn't your fault.  The walls here are just so thin.
Yeah.
Truck.  Of course.
So, how do you know the owner, Mr. Bianchinni?
No, but Caesar does.  He likes him. Says he's a good Italian.
I told Bianchinni I would take a look.  Is it that sink?
What do you want?
Because I want to.  I've wanted to since I first saw you in the elevator.
You have to ask?
I'm already in your bed.
My cellmate would say she did her time for getting caught.  She was always more honest than me.
It started way before I was around. I think basically it's because he thinks Johnnie is a complete idiot. But Johnnie runs Chicago because Gino is his father.
Sweet Jesus.
An accident.
If he does ...
Not Caesar.
It's all right, Violet.  It's working. All we got to do is wait him out and see what he does.
Listen, if he doesn't run, all you have to do is break down, go to your bedroom and pack some things, start crying, saying you love him but you can't do it.  You're sorry but you have to leave and just walk out.
You don't quit on me, Violet, and I won't quit on you.
Jesus Christ, Pop.  You got two hours until your plane leaves.
Don't worry about Caesar.  I'll handle Caesar.  You just get out of here, okay?
I told you, the family doesn't want the police around.  We want to take care of it ourselves and we will. I'll find him.  I swear I will.
I know you will.
I'm not asking.
Our last sighting was forty-eight hours ago.  Even if they stayed in the car, the grid is huge.  This is it.  He's trained -- conditioned -- they're built to disappear.  You give him another day to run and we may never find him.
-- if we can get a clean shot --
Treadstone?
One moment, please...  I'm afraid, I have no one by that name registered, sir.
...I understand...
His brother.  You know his brother?
Right.  Yes.  Of course.
Do you -- his brother -- do you have a phone number?
That'd be great.
I've got a situation here and --
Okay.  Twenty thousand.  Ten now.  Ten there.
Who pays twenty thousand dollars for a ride to Paris?
Yeah, well, welcome to the club.
When you think of it, before the ship -- before you wake up on the ship, what do you see?
What are you talking about?
Yeah.  Pull in here.  Park it.
I don't remember any of this.
Jason...
Anytime.
You got me pretty fucking curious.
How could I forget about you?  You're the only person I know.
I guess so.
Go ahead.
-- he's got my picture! -- this is yesterday! -- this is me! --  -- where did you get my picture? --
Marie -- look at me -- there's no time for this --
-- we can't stay here -- I can't stay here -- it's not safe here --
Oh, Jesus...
xxxxxx
This your store?
Shit, we didn't sign in.
Fine.  But I'd like to sign in.  In fact, I insist on it.  Where's the book?  I gotta sign in -- 
-- here we go -- I found it --
You're in danger.  All of you.  I have no time to explain.
<u>Miss Kreutz</u>, excuse me, but you entered into a fraudulent marriage in an effort to circumvent the immigration laws of the United States --
It's an angle of the street -- some sort of alleyway -- you can just...
Abbott wants to talk.
You're American.  I thought so. From your teeth -- the dental work --
Trouble with your air-conditioning.
...ditioning.
Machines don't fix themselves.
... fix themselves.
He's tampered with it, Dowser.
Got there!
...aven't you?
...Yer nostril?
You're putting your talents to very odd use Mr Lowry - yes, odd use - to pit wits against Central Services -
... get to it.
Where's Jill? What have you done to her? Where is she?!
I'm not a terrorist! You must know that! I'm not guilty! Get me out of here!
Sam, I think I ought to tell you ... I'm afraid she's upped stumps and retired to the pavilion.
No, no ... I did that...
Jack!
Problem? - No problem - yes, everything's going fantastically well, wonderful, marvelous, great career prospects, Alison in great shape, kids fine, beautiful home, I'm on Security Level Five now, and Mr Helpmann relies on me more and more, yes, couldn't be better, I feel terrifically motivated and job- rewarded -
Me? - if I'm worried about anyone, it's you. What happened to you, Sam? You were the brightest of us -
Sorry. Nothing.  See you - I'm going to be late.
You are late.
Sam, your life is going wrong - let your friends tell you - Records is a dead end department, no Security Level worth a damn, it's impossible to get noticed -
You remember Alison?
Yes, thanks.
Well, your A. Buttle has been confused with T47/215, an A. Tuttle. I mean, it's a joke! Somebody should be shot for that. So B58/732 was pulled in by mistake.
Sam, there are very rigid parameters laid down to avoid that event but Buttle's heart condition did not appear on Tuttle's file. Don't think I'm dismissing this business, Sam. I've lost a week's sleep over it already.
What has Tuttle done?
We suspect him of freelance subversion.
Very smart.
Out of kindness.
Well, I ... Good point. What do you suggest?
Er ... alright. For Christ's sake don't lose it. Here, you'd better sign for it.
Trust me.
What?
You think these are tits don't you?
Oh, sorry.
Really.
I thought you arrested me.
Now you're the one that's out of your mind.
It wasn't supposed to happen like this.
"And your children all gone."
Go away.
I saved you from the lorry and you're not very special.
........... It's a bomb isn't it?
C'mon. We've got to get out of here.
Expediting has put in for electrical procedures in respect of Buttle, Archibald, shoe repair operative, but Security has invoiced Admin for Tuttle, Archibald, heating engineer
I mean, Buttle! It's been confusion from the word go! He's been wrongly charged for Electromemorytherapy and someone somewhere is trying to make us carry the can!
Dead! Oh no! That's terrible! We'll never get rid of the damned thing! What are we going to do?
Drive out to Mrs Buttle, give her the cheque, tell her to sign her name on the back, cash it at the corner sweet shop.
Yes.  NO! You can't! You've only just turned it down! 
What?
You must be joking -  When there's a woman involved - there's no stopping me. Now, let me have that sheet.
She didn't say anything about it to me.
I'm sorry but ...
{suddenly unctious) Oh, but of course ...
I'm sorry Alma, I didn't mean to sound so ...
You're not listening, mother.
Er ... I assure you Mrs Buttle, the Ministry is always very scrupulous about following up and eradicating error. If you have any complaints which you'd like to make, I'd be more than happy to send you the appropriate forms.
Actually, there's someone I want to meet ...
I know, I know ...!
My complication had a complication, but Dr Chapman says I'll soon be up and bouncing about like a young gazelle. Are you buying a Christmas present for your mother?
It's too exciting. I've left Dr Jaffe and gone to Dr. Chapman.
Numero trois, steak.  Monsieur, Mesdames, Bon appetit.
I don't know which numero.
I'm sorry, but I'm a bit of a stickler for paper work. Where would we be if we didn't follow the correct procedures?
What?
You're killing me, you know that? You got no sick time according to Command. I've been told to terminate.
You swore you'd fire me if I came in late again.
No ...
Thanks for the translation.  What's your name? Nombre?
You can trust me on this one.
He's not a cop, he's a medic.  I'm CY Coates.
He flipped out.
Sleep is all stress reduction. Here.  You take one of these, sleep two hours, that's all you need.  Why do you think I'm telling you this, Frank--for my health?  You ought to look at yourself in the mirror, man. Kanita, get him a glass of water.
You're going to live.
That's too bad. Get some money, a nice looking girl on your arm, and everyone wants to take a piece. Some kid I wouldn't let wash my Mercedes is in my house, shooting at me. Damn, I thought I could make it onto the balcony like Tiger. He's fat, that's why, falls faster. I'm trying to watch my weight, and look what happens. Am I shot, Frank?
Boy can't shoot for shit, either. Goddamn that's hot.
What's his name?
You came out of the hospital. You were tied down and hallucinating. You got some bad chemicals in your head, Noel. There's some medicine at the hospital that will fix that.
Well, you have your choice: pills, injection, gas.
Even when you say the things, there's always more things.
That's my brother's problem. He's passed out inside.
He's dead, huh?
She should go home.
Hello, I'm Frank Pierce, from the ambulance last night. I brought your father into the hospital and I just learned some news.
How is she?
He's better.
On yeah? I went to Holy Name. Where'd you go to high school?
Five years.
I'm all right. I just can't stand to see people tied up.  I'm in the waiting room for hours, listening to Noel screaming. The only reason he's screaming is 'cause he's tied up.
Don't be a cop. If you have any doubts about this, it's my fault.
It'll be a while before he's up and running again.
No, we just ate. I only remember how tough my father was. Now I know he had to be like that, to make us tough. This city'll kill you if you aren't strong enough.
Frank.
He's dead unless you folks want to stop bullshitting me and tell it straight. Then, Lord willing, we'll try to bring him back.
Where the guy jumped and you almost fell. No, you never told me that story.
She's the daughter of a cardiac arrest I brought in last night. I told her we'd give her a ride back to Misery. Her father's showing signs of improving.
What about rule number three: Don't get involved with dispatchers named Love.
It's coming.
I quit! I'm through!
Burke. You won't believe it. He's showing cognitive signs. He started with spontaneous respiration, now he's fighting to pull out the tube. Had to sedate him. He's in a CAT scan. I'm giving him every test I can: thromboytics, steroids, nitrodrips, heparin.
What do you think?
That's good, Frank. No, but they might surgically implant one, about the size of my thumb. It goes near the shoulder here, with two electrodes connected to the heart. It sends a shock whenever it senses a drop in blood flow. Amazing, isn't it?
Ten-four. El Toro de Oro. Blast off.
Look out!
Well, he's the steakhead of the night, then.
Well, why don't they put him away? Prisons don't want him. I took him to the hospital yesterday and here he is again.
That's ridiculous.
Believe me, it always works. The simpler, the better.
Frank!
I eat. I just haven't had coffee yet.
Coffee and whiskey, lucky you ain't dead with that diet. Wait, I've got it. Half fried chicken with fries. Let's go, hurry up. Come on.
What?
Faster!
You have no sick time, Frank. No time of any kind. Everyone knows that.
Take me back, put me to bed; I surrender. We've done enough damage tonight.
Used to be my partner.
Yes, Zebra. You'll be driving to the man who needs no introduction, chronic caller of the year three straight and shooting for number four. The duke of drunk, the king of stink, our most frequent flier, Mr. Oh.
You have the job you have...
There are only ten.
I'm starting to... We may do the capitols of the states.
Fifty, right?
Your coat jacket is rising up in back.
The pointers were great.  I'll study the tape.
Hold it down, okay?
I'm going to miss you -- you're a prick in a great way...
No, I liked the way it made me sound. Okay.  Be good.  So long.
Stop the tape, okay.  Forget it, Ellen.  Let's call security and get him out.
Sure.
Wouldn't this be a great world if insecurity and desperation made us more attractive?  If needy were a turn-on?
Eleven and a half.
Last time Paul was sick they gave Connie the weekend news instead of me.
Sounds like you may be on to something.
Absolutely...You go have a good time... You have some place to go?
They're not that dumb, after all.
Could you at least pretend that this is an awkward situation for you -- me showing up while you're getting ready for a date.
No.
Do you feel good about it?
Stop kidding.  I want to know what happened.
Let me think a second.  It's tough.
You can't end up with Tom because it goes totally against everything you're about.
Yes.
You won't be able to stay mad at me, right?
In other times, with other purposes, there might be a band and bunting here at the bus depot for J.D. Singer's return from war.  Last week he was decorated by a president for heroism in a war.  But it was the civil war -- in Angola -- and he was in it for the money.
I'm no suggesting the worst will happen...but someone with your brilliance gets nibbles about other jobs and maybe, the next time that happens, down the road -- you should look into it.
Ah, damn -- the fucking jerks -- My, God.  They want to fire me.
All I know is that they've got to fire a large number of people... and they're not going by seniority. There's a recklessness in the air. They...
Uh-uh.  I'm a little freaked right now about seeing my father though.
Oh, that's nice...  We'll need some new lines.
You can make it a little less brutal by knocking a million dollars or so off your salary.
I'll be right down.  It's right tight.
I spent a fortune on this.
Please, Bobbie, we're pushing.
Hey, okay.  Look Buddy -- I've got to go to work.
Tell me I'm on the way in.
It's Paul.
Honey?...
You don't have to finish tonight.
It's not.
I'll just have to try harder.  I don't know.  I will.  I will.  I will.  I will.
Well, they say if you can reach even one person, it means something... And you did that.
What about the obvious remedy? Reversing things.  Maybe getting a job on a newspaper.
I don't write.
You weren't.  Thanks.  How does it feel being here?
No.  Aaron and I go to Central America on Wednesday -- so I'm cramming.
You  make me nervous.  Anyway if I can pick your brain --
Do I have to stand here in the middle and meet them all?
Uh-huh.
Oh, good.
Uh-uh.
You just can't stop editing me. Huh?
Right, right -- Isn't she fun to tease?
Okay.  Sorry.  Don't yell at me like that again, you scared the life out of me.
Where are you?
Well, when?
No.  That sounds more important. Let's forget about tonight.
That's so perfectly...It really makes me feel a little faint...  Whooo.
Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane...
You keep coming after me and looking down on me.  It's starting to make me batty.
Well, let's do a special report on that...I mean that's news.
What I don't know, I can learn and what I know, nobody can teach. Excuse me for saying it about myself, but I think it's true.  What do you think?  Never mind what you think.
I thought for ol' Cliff here -- Look at you?  You're more adorable than your pictures.  Look what I got for you.
I'm sorry because I was looking forward to that, but I' m going back in a few hours.
Right back to you.
Yes.  Fifty dollars an hour, right?
Yeah it was all just an accident.
It wasn't easy.
Now you're a professional!
All about me...
Carla -
What are you doing here so early?
Don't ask.
Oh come on!  Even you can see its value.
Yeah then you could unload - sell this stuff for a lot more.
You see the direction his realism takes! It's unhealthy!
Well, it all depends, Leonard...
I think he's looking for you, man... it's all finally catching up with you!
I don't know it was made out of driftwood and dipped in sulfuric acid.  It was out there...
Right.  Ain't no body of work complete without some... nudes -
Yeah what's this, Murdered Elephant?
No man, he ain't the type.  He don't get enough vitamin E.
Well that's not what I pay you for, now is it?
Well I was uh, just looking...
Got carried away, huh?
Sure!  So I guess that means I'm an artist after all.
Have a seat -
What am I doing?  I'm just telling Walter the truth.
It was.
Well, w-what did you do?
What offers have you got for it? I won't be out-bidded.  I'm a wealthy man and I don't mind paying for something I want.
I'm holding for Lieutenant Beldere!
Listen to me, listen to me...I've been collecting art pieces all over the world for years and let me tell you something.  This newcomer Walter Paisley has it, whatever it is, the X factor, that indefinable quality that separates the greats from the hacks, and I want that cat in my hands.  Are you listening to me?
Oh yeah that was Mayolia, she's a nice girl.  She's kind of strange, though.
C-connection?
I didn't do nothing wrong!  That was Mayolia's!  I didn't ask her for it.  I don't know about any -
I ain't going no place with you!
I see the rewards of achievement have come your way.
Uh, I don't know.
Suit yourself.
T-turned on?
Let it inspire you.  Maybe it will let you think of me.
Oh no, that's OK, I can fix myself something.  Besides, I got something important to do...
Noise Mrs. Swicker?  What noise?
I was just straightening up the place.
Cheer up.  You may still.
No... Not a boy...  Find out if they're dead.  And do something about that arm.  Honestly, I don't know how you made it through the Crusades.
I don't know.  Coach said I had to work on my 'ab's.'
Jeffrey, I don't mean to sound sexist or anything, but can I borrow her?
We hate you guys!
You didn't like them.
I'm fine.
The sun!  It burns!  It burns!
Yes.
Guys.  The environment.  I'm telling you, it's totally key.  The earth is in terrible shape, we could al die, and besides, Sting's doing it.
Uum... around ten?
It's the news, Buffy.
Mmmnkay.
So I noticed.
Oh, come on, Buffy.  You know what's going on.  It's not working out at all.  I've got to move on.  I mean, I've got needs, too.  I told you about all this.
You left me a message?
No...
Not exactly.
Yeah.
Where are you gonna go?
No, you're not.
You sure?
I know.
You're weird and I'm afraid of you. Seriously, Cassandra, there's a lot cooler things you could be doing than your homework.
Like what?
Kimberly, it's the senior dance.
Yeah, whoops I came.
You look way pretty, Kim.
You're one of those skanky old men that, like, attack girls and stuff. Forget you.  My, um, my boyfriend is gonna be here in about thirty seconds, and he's way testy.
Chosen to go to the graveyard?  Why don't you just take the first runner up, okay?
I don't have time for your prattling. I have proof.  You bear the mark.
Why didn't you ever tell anybody about your dreams?
There's a great deal I have to show you, I'm not even sure where to start  There's so little time.
Great.  First I have a birthright, now I've got a fate.  Hey, do I have to take notes on this?
But you enjoyed it, yes?
Yes, yes.  It would be interesting. A nice cheer.
If I say 'no' does that make me a bad person?
Good Lord.  What do you study in history?
Same one.
Oh.
Fine.
A what?
A wet!  Didn't I just kill that vampire?  I think I did.  I didn't see you killing any vampires.  You were too busy playing 'Beat the Clock'.
I'm curious, is all.
Another distraction.  It's not right.
All right.
That's the plan.
Yes, I'm sure they do.  This place is everything you said it was, Amilyn.
Nee sitch.  No way.
I'm sorry.  I'm Pike.  This is Benny.
Pike isn't a name.  It's a fish.
Nice much.
As long as there's room for three in it.  What, didn't you bring your new friends?
You said "Crash".
What?
Catch?
Just do what I say.  Now, which nostril are you breathing through?
It's all the same thing.
Y'know, Annie, I been thinking if it works for one game, maybe it'll work for a whole buncha games.
Not that.  I mean the re-channeling of my sexual energy.  Maybe we shouldn't make love for awhile.
Get over here.
You can't seduce me.
I figure we could work on some fundamentals even if we don't make love.
What'd he say?
He did?
That's great!
How can I possibly thank you?
What do you believe in?
Yep.
I think Thomas Pynchon's a genius.
What'you see in that guy--he's dim, pretty boy.  a young, wild,
Young men are uncomplicated.  And he's not "dim".  He's just inexperienced.  My job is to give him "life-wisdom" and help him make it to the major leagues.
Fact is you're afraid of meeting a guy like me 'cause It might be real so you sabotage it with some bullshit about commitment to a young boy you can boss around--  Great deal.  You get to write self- indulgent little poems all winter about how hard it is to find a man even though you just sent him packing-  So what do you really want?  You wanta be a tragic woman figure wallowing in the bullshit of magic?  Or do you want a guy?
You got me all confused.
--and as soon as we lose a game, he'll be back in your arms.
I was raised in a Baptist church got dipped in the water when I was 5-- born again before kindergarten...by the time I was 10 I knew it was bullshit and at 15 I ran away from home...
Who?
I quit.  Hit my dinger and hung 'em up.
Yeah...you a witch?
Praise the Lord, eh?
You got a live arm there.
Who's he play for?
Well, he sort of pitches for the Cosmic All-Stars.
Never heard of 'em.
Chicken bone cross take the curse off this bat and bring me hits.
Will that work for me?
It was a cocksucking call!
No!  I said It was a cock-sucking call and you can't run me for that!
You're a cocksucker!
I told him.
I just wanta play everyday despite small nagging injuries--and go home to a woman who appreciates how full of crap I truly am.
What would you think of a pitcher who wore women's panties?
I want you to throw this one at the bat rack.
Why?!  I'm finally throwin' the damn thing where I want to.
It'll keep the fear of God in the hitters.  Trust me.
Jesus.
I'm nervous--my old man's here.
You know what the difference Is between hitting .250 and hitting .300?  1 got it figured out.  Twenty-five hits a year in 500 at bats is 50 points.  Okay?  There's 6 months in a season, that's about 25 weeks--you get one extra flare a week--just one--a gork, a ground ball with eyes, a dying quail-- just one more dying quail a week and you're in Yankee Stadium!
What?
See ya at the yard, Meat.
--we had the gun on him tonight-- the last five pitches he threw were faster than the first five. 96 miles an hour, 98, 97, 97. 97.   He's got the best young arm I've seen in 30 years.
I heard he's wearing women's underwear--and he's breathing through his pingala nostril.
He said his chakras were jammed and he was breathing out of the wrong nostril.
It's a damn convention.
They called me up to the Show and I wanta tell Crash goodbye.
What?
I can't believe you're doing this.
Now, instead of the cops only lookin' at Nicky, they started looking at Green too. And he was supposed to be our squeaky...
He's lying.
Was I at that dinner?
Yes, you were.
A powerful man.
But Andy also took orders. And when he was told to give a pension fund loan to Philip Green...
Why would they want to find out? We're puttin' a hundred million into this desert here. Why would they want to lock us out?  And besides, they'll never find out. All you gotta do is keep changing your job title. Like, uh, from Casino Executive to Food and Beverage Chairman. And what happens it, they take your application, they put it at the bottom of the pile. I know guys workin' there for thirty years, don't have a license.
Fine, fine. How's your family?
Hello.
Yeah, is this Lester? This is Sam...
...listen to me very carefully. I want to talk to Ginger. I want my kid back. I want her put on a plane immediately.
Oh, no, please, please.
He bet like a fuckin' brain surgeon.
If he don't know, nobody knows. Told you it was eight.
So, I'm lucky. I'm not allowed to get lucky in this place?
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?
Nope, there's no way.
Hey, Rich.
It's impossible. It's booked up, and you gotta make a reservation.  It's...
Well, it's okay. I'll use the service entrance. I'll see you at nine.
Yeah, that's out of context. Okay.
I lost control?
My wife?
Yeah.
I - I would appreciate it if you'd stay out of my personal life, okay? You wouldn't like it if I did it to you.
Please...
And I - what was I supposed to do, throw her out?
The problem was, Nicky was not only bringin' heat on himself, but on me too. The FBI watched every move he made. But he didn't care. He just didn't care.
No, a...
Why?
You want me to get out of my own fuckin' town?!
Oh, I don't know whether you know this or not, but you only have your fuckin' casino because I made that possible!
I'm only on TV because I gotta be able to hang around the casino. You understand that. You know that. Come on.
Your fuckin' ass! You could have had the food and beverage job without goin' on television!  You wanted to go on TV.
Yeah, I did want to go on TV. That way I have a forum. I can fight back. I'm known. People see me. They know they can't fuck around with me like they could if I was an unknown. That's right.
No, it - it - Nicky, when you asked me if you could come out here, what did I tell you? I mean, you asked me, and I knew you were going to come out no matter what I said, but what did I tell you? Do you remember what I told...
Hey, Sammy, tell this Jew motherfucker over here to pay that marker.
Yeah? Nicky, I want to talk to that fuckin' bitch.
You see?  Never tells me nothin'. Ace, what do we got on for next week?
Okay. You come by the house?
Let's go to lunch. Do you want to go to the Riviera?
Well, sir, I was just...
...trying to offer you the respect that your...
I...
Mr Rothstein... well, sometimes, when you reach that pressure point, when you put that pressure point on them, you know, it shows...
It's always been our policy -
...And this is Ronnie, who takes care of the card room...
I don't care what she is. She's an institution, that's the problem. She's lazy.
Yeah, I know all that.
You sure?
It's chinchilla.
So, I put two million in cash in a Los Angeles bank under the name of Mr and Mrs Tom Collins. This was strictly my shakedown and kidnapping money.
She could be the most charming woman you ever saw. People loved to be around her.
Oh, fabulous.
Well, if you want a coat, you got it. You know that. It's not the money, it's just why do you want it?  That's all I'm askin'. Am I not entitled to that?
Isn't it bad enough you're drinkin' too much, you're takin' all my pills too?
If not for me, at least for Amy.
No, you don't.
What do you mean?
What about the money? Uh, where's the box?
It's under...
All right...
Twenty-five thousand for clothes.
Mm-hm.
I bought him a watch too.
At the most, which is impossible for him.
There's nothin' to figure out. I'm home... we're workin' it out.
You'll come back tomorrow and get the rest. Just get out of here.
I had a... salad.
Listen to me, listen to me, listen to me.  Listen, you fuckin' cunt.
You want your jewelry?
You're gonna be sorry if you don't stop that.
Don't you remember? You promised me a fair hearing when you were gettin' comped at my hotel and you were asking me for copies of your bills so -
What are they doin' way back there? Bring 'em up here where they belong. You can't even see 'em over there.
Well...
Don't thank me, just do it. You're the Slots Manager. I shouldn't have to tell you this.
Hey... Ward, you're pissin' me off. Now, you're insulting my intelligence. What do you think, I'm a fuckin' idiot? You know goddamn well somebody had to get into those machines and set those fuckin' reels.
I really think you're overreacting in this whole -
Well, thank you. Why don't you take that fuckin' pen and shove it up you ass, you fuckin' jag-off?
Yeah?
Come on, go back there? I never got paid my expenses for the last trip.
Yeah, least you could do is return my phone calls, though.
I'll to the FBI!
He tries to do everything...
Why, does it look like it's bothering me? What do I give a fuck?  Fuckin' Oscar too. All the fuckin' money I've given that prick, he don't even look over here. What's his problem?
Well, listen, uh... Good luck with the joint, huh? 
Artie! Artie!
We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting -
I'll take care of it, Remo.
You see... I wouldn't want to be jeopardizing anything for people who are our friends. You understand?
No. I - I'm just curious, you know. I was wonderin' how much he would put into a thing like that. That's all.
I understand that. But, you know, I think you should try to make the best of it now. Go slow, you know. See what happens.
You're a beautiful girl. You don't want to ruin your looks. I've seen a lot of girls get shot to hell from this stuff.
No, I really do. I think he's gonna kill me.
Oh, you're right, I know.  It's... well, I was just -
Okay.
Yeah.
Me? I said... nothin'. I said, I said, 'No, no, no.' Everything he said, I just kept sayin' no.
Get the fuck out of here. Get out! Get the fuck out!
All right, all right.
Ginger, I've been watching you all night. You've been stealing from me.
Yes.
No, Lester.
You do?
It means I got the money.
We're going to Europe. Let the adults talk.  You dye your hair... you get plastic surgery, like we talked about. Right? You're the mother. How much do you think he's gonna pay to get this fuckin' kid back?
No, I'm gonna drive.
Come on, damn it. Don't get so defensive. It could be stuck in your hair, you know.
Boy, look at this place, huh?
Let 'em complain. I'm the one who's here.
What? Get out of here? I got a marker comin'.
Angelo and Buster.
Yeah, but I'm not sure yet.
Yeah, just let me know. But you gotta be ready. You know what I'm talkin' about?
Dominick said they're in the motel?
No more! You see? Watch!
Hey.
What thing? Oh, Nicky... I thought you was layin'.
...this, uh, this Commission is prepared to act on a motion denying the Rothstein application.
Do I hear a motion seconded?
There's a lot of people here.
Mom, I'm sorry, they're beatin' me left and right.  Ma, I'm sorry. I'm all upset.
Having a good time?
That's a good one, dude. He says we're going to kill you whether you tell us where the disc is or not.
Guilty. I am.
There's a nice cafe down the street...unless you're afraid of this Catwoman prowling around. We can always dine at the mansion, if..
No it's not.
Fine. You're angry. Don't be. The important thing is we're together now..
It would be honor, Brock. Now let's go get this guy...
We'll hunt him down together...
I lied.
She has a real spirit.
Yes, did you call us here for any particular reason?
But it's true!  You can call him yourself.
Your uniform, that first time I saw you, was a ghastly cage I vowed to unlock in order to..
Quiet, Blender Boy. I told you from the beginning, Selina, I'm not a very good liar. I am not Captain God, or whatever else he may be calling himself this month, but when I find out who is--The Man will pay.  My sister died in that Museum attack. You can check the Atlanta obituaries. I've tracked these monsters from city to city, waiting for a time to exact my revenge. Why else would I come to Oasisburg and create the most obnoxious casino in the world?
Priceless...We have a showdown in this alley, right?
What do you want from me?
At this point, a nap. Oh by the way, I killed your butler and your dog..
You were right all along--the two parts to a person are the reality and the lie.  I was making good money as a top architect--but that's not who I am. I'm not an architect, I'm a..
Well then, let's agree to disagree...Now how about a picture for my scrapbook?
"Well done," Cactus.
What did you say?
I know how you feel, humiliated in the hands of a woman. I'd rather eat my soul on a paper plate...
Yeah...pretty gross. Hurry, we've got work to do.
Absolutely.
What's the matter with you, Spooky, my most trusted comrade?  We are warriors!  These are the challenges we live for!
Kelly, get to work on those new uniforms.  I'm not running a summer camp here..
Ah!  Ah!--God no, don't tell me you're one of those women who are attracted to ruggedly handsome and brilliant architects..
Nothing. How's your hand?
Not too cool...
We have to do something. What can we do to help, Selina?
Maybe.
What kind of name is "Brock Leviathan?"
Mom, not now!  I, I don't know what to do..
I don't know if I can do it alone.
I'm not sad, no, I owe the Captain my life. It's just you think you want to help prevent crime, but you realize that's too complicated. It's a lot more fun to punish crime. Then after a while, you don't care what's a crime and what's not, what you became a Warrior for. You just want the kicks. The rush.
Do I hear a woman's voice?
This is my conversation.  I'll say what I fucking please.
Any trouble, we whip out our Treasury Department badges -- show them the wire I'm wearing and read them their rights.  Theo seizes the Krugerands as evidence. Naturally they start negotiating. Offer to give us up somebody else. And we listen.  Take notes on who bought what stolen art and tell them we have to clear it with our superiors at Justice.  We pick up their passports -- escort them to their room and leave them all in the bathroom handcuffed to the plumbing.
We've already got an ambulance on the way.  Don't try to get out.
Mind letting me make the best of a rotten situation?
You never miss a trick.
I'll see that he stays calm.  Pack the money up and put it in the trunk.
Bullshit.
Will you relax?  This in no way affects our business.  Go on.
Make a "U" and go back.
Let's hope so.  Once you come out and okay everything I'll give Caitlin the sign that she can bring the painting on over.
We'll toss it when we make the blind curve.
I'm still in my cab -- jammed up in traffic.  Are you there yet?
And what're you whispering for?
You may be our only chance.  I don't know if I can do this again.
Well I'm not tolerant of being bothered with this bullshit story when I'm about to make the most important score of my life.  This has gotta be some "put-on," right?
Because you know you'll be killing us.
What makes you say that?
He pulled us over as we left the Riviera Tennis Club.  Claimed we'd run a stop sign.  And when Elliot was reaching for his license --
They don't know you.  They won't listen.
Forget who I am.  Where's this school located?
She would if she heard my voice on the phone.
Just hang on.  I've got a life of my own.
A woman?
I didn't mean to open up any old wounds.
I sure as hell got my wish.  She doesn't exist.  So maybe you reached the appropriate person after all.
Lady, you don't have to keep up a running commentary.
I'm afraid if I stop talking I'll lose you.  Just name any reasonable amount and it's yours.
You're breaking up.  I can't hear you.  Theo?
I might still get there first. The lights are with me.  How would I identify the guy who shows up at the bank?
Yeah, sure that's me.  Ask anybody.
Hi Lenore.  It's me.  I got you back.  Courtesy of Star 69.  Are you hurt?
Yes sir.
Put the man back on.
The rest of the money is here in the car.  Why don't you come and get it?
You timed that beautifully.
He seems to think he's entitled to it all.
Do you have to point that?
Naturally you didn't learn your lesson.
You wouldn't --
Stop talking like that!
Then scream for me.  A repeat performance.  Let me see how easy you can turn it on.  Scream!  I want to hear you scream for me!
The money, Nels ... ?
Why are we stopping?
Only one way to find out.
Toss them -- one at a time.  I don't want to lose count.
Don't leave me here to die -- Theo, please -- you can't let me die --
You got time on your side.  Pretty soon they'll be missed and we'll have the law up our ass.
What time frame have you got in mind?
I'm three quarters of the way up the lot behind the concession stand.
Stay there.
It's your call.
I don't want to see her later.  I want to hear her <u>now</u>.
It's in the process.
I make my end of the cash at 184,000.  Now I'm trying to figure out the bonds.  What the face value is.
Negative.
And they run straight to the cops who start looking for our van.
That's how it is.  You see her approaching you toss out installment one.
Put the girl on.
Okay Nels, you can always keep what you've got and haul ass leaving the lovely lady for me to worry about.  I'll bet she can be friendly when it's in her best interests.
If you're looking for a quickie all you've got to do is ask.
And I end up in a fucking neck brace for life!
Then you can sue the cops. Collect from both ends.  Tighten your belts.  Here it comes.  Ready?
That bitch.  What's keeping you from taking off?
Sweet revenge plus maybe a bit of vigorish off your end.
How do you know?
In your dreams.
Don't underestimate me.  I've got original ideas of my own.  Warhol got famous doing a soup can.  What would you think of a cellular phone done in acrylics?
Where is this canyon house where you're supposed to hook up?
Is that good or bad?
Thanks.
Who knows the secrets of the human heart.
Persistent.
Did I?
Like treacle.
Not you. How quaint. How old-fashioned and quaint. Isn't it, Col?
Like what?
Must be.
Tough guy, huh? Are you going to be all right on your own?
How different?
Tell me about him.
What is this?
I'm thinking of your man.
Dil --
I have to talk to her, Col --
Nothing's wise.
Make it up to me, then.
Know what I didn't know. And don't call me that.
Okay. Be a good girl and go inside.
You could say that.
And you're not going to tell me more?
Told you to stay in the hotel!
I like you, DIl
Anything.
I'd do anything for you, Dil.
I asked you a question, honey -- were you there too --
Do I?
Meet Col --
Please, Dil --
Need to lose myself awhile.
No way, Jude. I'm out.
Of course. I forgot.
We'll be on the other side. We'll move when you do.
Fergus, I think you don't trust me.
Yes.
Why?
Would make me feel better about it.
Should blow you away, you know that?
Doesn't matter who he is. He is what we would call a legitimate target.
No?
Could you?
Not in your nature.
No, what's the funny thing?
My inside pocket.
Don't you think of it, fucker.
You fuckers set me up. That bitch --
That game where a bunch of paddies whack sticks at each other?
Come on, man. If this shit was all over.
We got simple tastes, you and me.
Yes.
Some kinds of women are...
Dil wasn't trouble. No trouble at all.
If they kill me --
Stop it --
When I was a child...
Yeah?
So if I ran now, there's no way I'd beat you, is there?
Hurling --
You didn't?
You shut your face --
Shut the fuck up, Jude.
You greenhorn -- you half-witted, thick-skulled, hare-brained, greenhorn! They wuz both too smart for us!
Is there a Mrs. Canfield?
I think that's what you ordered.
How was I leading you on?
What?
Grandpierre asked me about an appointment Charles had -- on the day he was killed.
I'm through listening to you!
What a terrible thing to say. How could you even think that?
Mrs. Lampert -- Mrs. Charles Lampert.
You mean spies and things like that?
Someone has to do it, Mrs. Lampert --
Yes -- That all he needs is a code book and a cyanide pill and he's in business.
Your husband was wanted by the U. S. government.
Oh, haven't I? The money -- Mrs. Lampert -- the money. The $250,000 Charles Voss received from the auction. Those three men want it, too -- they want it very badly.
But --
Were you followed?
Well, if I'm going to die, I might as well do it for my country.
No, Mrs. Lampert.
You're in an ideal position -- he trusts you.  Besides, you said yourself, women make the best spies.
I told them what you said -- about this man being Carson Dyle's brother. I asked them what they knew about it and they told me -- you're not gonna like this, Mrs. Lampert -- they told me Carson Dyle has no brother.
Is there a Mrs. Cruikshank?
My mother -- she lives in Detroit. Come on now -- give me those stamps.
You're out, Dyle -- right now!
I had to -- for all I knew you could have been in on the whole thing.
Scobie?
Would you like to see where I was tattooed?
There's an old riddle about two tribes of Indians -- the Whitefeet always tell the truth and the Blackfeet always lie. So one day you meet an Indian, you ask him if he's a truthful Whitefoot or a lying Blackfoot? He tells you he's a truthful Whitefoot, but which one is he?
Okay -- I'll tell you what -- we'll just sit around all day long being frivolous -- how about that?
Who told you to do that?
Whoever it is won't give up -- and neither will I.
I'll be right there.
I don't know -- it depends on whether or not they've already eaten.
No -- Gene Kelly. Remember the way he danced down there next to the river in 'American in Paris' -- without a care in the world? This is good, want some?
Shut the door!
I don't think I know that one.
I keep thinking about Charles and Scobie -- and the one who's going to be next -- me?
Carson Dyle didn't have a brother.
Why don't you shut up!
Well!
No -- he's not the same. Alexander Dyle was interested in clearing up his brother's death. Adam Canfield is a crook. And with all the advantages you've got -- brains, charm, education, a handsome face --
The man who bought them last week was American. I did not see him but I heard. I knew you would come.
The best for the last -- le chef- d'oeuvre de la collection. The masterpiece. It is the most valuable stamp in the world. It is called 'The Gazette Guyanne.' It was printed by hand on colored paper in 1852 and marked with the initials of the printer.  Today it has a value of $100,000.  Eh, bien -- I am not a thief. I knew there was some mistake. Take them.
I don't know anything.
I'm very cold.
I don't know. Perhaps he met somebody.
Is that all? Can I go now?
I don't know -- how would I know?
Well, you go in and you ask for some toothpaste -- the small size -- and the man brings you the large size. You tell him you wanted the small size but he says the large size is the small size. I always thought the large size was the largest size, but he says that the family size, the economy size and the giant size are all larger than the large size -- that the large size is the smallest size there is.
Is your husband with you?
I phoned but nobody answered. I wanted to tell you how sorry I am -- and to find out if there was anything I could do.
Fun and games. Evidently we're the floorshow.
I wasn't --
How do you shave in there?
What was what?
What your husband was mixed up in.
Where?
Good night.
Of course I'll help -- I told you I would, didn't I? Come on now --
What is it, Reggie -- what's he saying?
He -- he said if I didn't give the money, he'll kill me.
Don't ask me -- I'm only the widow.  If Charles had died in bed we wouldn't even have him.
Those stamps -- they're worth a fortune!
Don't be un-neighborly-like, Herman -- don't forget he done us a little ol' favor.
We want that money -- now!
That's an awful lot for ten minutes of beasting?
I get the imports.
Oh GOD Brent, is there anything you don't feel guilty about?
I'm going to tell them everything I know. I'm calling a town meeting for eight p.m.
Daddy you scared me!
You're grounded Friday night!
I want you to head right home after school.
Daddy, are you upset that I'm still a virgin?!
I am. I'm so very proud of you. Go back to sleep.
Are you sure?
She said she was Kenny's aunt Lisa.
Who is she Daddy?
There's a Lisa Shermer living just sixty miles west of here. Over the Indiana border. I'm going.
No?
Are you sure?
She's still a virgin.
A bullet to the right cerebellum.
She was murdered?
I've been in a lot of people's houses and this one's the creepiest.
Call Brent on the horn. See where he is. What he wants us to do. I'll head over to the school.
Ok. Should I put my bike in the back of your car?
Of course I'm scared.
Lisa Sherman was my mother. Do you know who that is?
Don't you want to talk to him? You watch him eat everyday.
How do you know what to type back when they start to cyber with you.
FINE. Are you?
Especially not your dad.
Stag?
Jody, you have to go to the party. For your own safety.
They're all on microfiche. What year are you looking for?
Not at all. In fact, I thought about going.
No.
You're sweet. I really wish someone had thrown a party like that when I was your age. My life might have been very different.
Three of our classmates are dead. That's not really the occasion for a party.
You know I want to go with you.
But if he'd been sent to jail, there would be no Jody.
Just making me feel like a piece of meat.
Quick! In the house. He won't look for us in there.
Pretend we're just another couple.
Mom?
I need to ask you something.
You can ask me anything.
That's what he said.
Did he say anything else about her?
You didn't believe her?
They were proving to her they weren't. They were very drunk. Things were different back then. You think kids are sexually bottled up today....
What?
No, you keep one.
Ok.
Maybe you better just drive me home.
On our way home, a drunken driver could hit us head on and send us flying through the windshield. Terminate us instantly. We'd never experience what it means to make love.
That wasn't me ...
I know. I'm kidding you. Chill out.
Unfair?!
INT. ANDY'S ICE CREAM FACTORY/STAIRWELL - DAY.
Uh, between this month and last month, you owe four hundred and seventeen dollars.  And we need that in cash.
Yeah, well, Darlene didn't say anything about it to me, so tell Andy to bill her like usual and let them sort it out. Move.
Well, he told me to collect cash.
Andy.  Another fuckin'...
...for Andy, I'll tell him I lost a few cartons comin' over  the mountain.
Huh?
No, no, no.  You don't need my truck. You need somebody else's truck...
Hey, listen!  Do you know what I think?  I...
Wait, wait, wait.  Hold up.  Hold up.  Look.
I got, like, uh....
What the hell's goin' on?
You'd better coast through...

To get to McGruder, you have to go through Missoula, and I ain't goin' to Missoula.
I ain't goin' through Missoula!
Look, I don't give a shit if you go through Missoula at a hundred miles an hour.  We're goin' to McGruder.
...you.
Well, then, that means it's call...


Eight and a half feet wide!  Weighs over five tons!
Oh, shit.
Oh, Petey.  Oh, Petey.  Oh, please, Pete.  Please don't do this to me.  Okay.
God, man!
Oh, shit.  Come on, old...
...Night Shift, but you might...
 
 Go, go.

...yeah.
 Aw, shit  

Oh, shit.  Okay.  Come on.

...-tion?
It won't even start half the time.
...there'd be a sales rep desk with my name on it.  But every time something opened up, there'd be some idiot cousin...
...or nephew or some good old boy...
Nobody's lookin' out for my interests.  My credit was fucked!  And then when he promoted Sam over me, I just snapped.  So I split.
So you took his...
How wonderful for you.
Started every game my senior year.  Not all-American or anything, but not bad. Anyway, the real star was my best friend, the quarterback.  Got taken in the first round.
Not completely, anyway.
...Long.  Somethin' about that look in his eye when he talked about that Elvis...
That is loud!  I'm 
 Come on!
Oh.
Come here.
...to him. 
You got Elvis?!
Go!
Okay.  Okay.
Whoo!
What do you think I'm doin'?!


Sorry.
They'll meet you at the top.
...us.
Don't be tedious, waiter.  Dr. Long called it Elvis.
Oh, my God.
So...where's my truck?
I had no idea how powerful it was.
...about the man who did this, he's-he's comin' after it.
 ...have it.  You have to...have to get it to M...to McGruder.
Hold it!
Your country and a lot of innocent people in it...
I'd say we're about even.
The NSA thinks the UN is onto your work...
 All right.  One more shot, provided...  we're off the island tonight.

Damn you, Long!  My people are out there! Your people are out there!
It's too...
...not at all like a man responsible for the deaths of eighteen peo-...
Oh, I'm well aware of what the government did, I assure you.  Actually, I've just come to say how grateful I am to you...
...and the government.
Mm-hm.
Together, you gave me the opportunity to realize just how very wrong my life had gone.
What rational man could fit in with the sorts of things our government was doing? The sorts of things you've...
...happen if I drop this?
Pleasant surprise.
And I certainly can't say it's pleasant.
...I lost all my squeamishness at Leav- ...
...here!
Closin' down, sir.
We're in.
No.  A pair of average citizens have decided to risk their lives for their country.  I almost remember what that feels like.
Having witnessed the effects myself, I can assure you it'll be very useful when the bidding starts.
Carl, Dennis, get out of sight.
We were called in by the Jerome base...
...to pursue a man who's stolen government proper-...
Right.  Tim Mason.
...-fall.
 But...
...screwup?
Yeah, they call me Dar-...
...Long.
...and ask a simple question -   Are you actually prepared...
...to die for a country that's...


Oh.  Well, I have got to get to the dentist be-...
...somehow. 
His I know.  Yours I don't have a clue.  But if it wasn't for you, I think he'd have drifted right on through this town.
Go.
INT. VITELLI'S HELICOPTER - DAY. 
And where are you going?
I don't suppose you'd like to tell me what this is all about.
Have you I.D.'d the bodies?

Been trying to figure out your secret.
...like a fish.
...sensitivity without neurosis.  He's...
...without caution...
Doc!
And what if it does?
Doctor.
If you're not out of there soon, I have got to seal the...
...uh, drifting around like the trash you are, or were you here workin'?
...badge someday, then you can ask the questions.  Until then...
I don't sell beer to minors.  I take that kinda thing...
Then how about if I call you "ass-...
...hands!


BLACK BACKGROUND.
INT. GOMEZ'S HELICOPTER - DAY.
INT. TUNNEL - DAY.
Sir, this is not a lending library, it's the Hall of Records.
They're calling it an accident.
Too bad?
Was he right?
You mean the little chippie he was with at the El Macando?
No. She's probably scared to death.
Wouldn't it be useful to talk to her?
What about her?
Have you got your checkbook handy, Mr. Cross? I've got the girl.
Off the alley.
Could you drive me somewhere?
The apple core?
Well, to tell you the truth, I lied a little.
Well, sometimes it takes a while for a man to find himself and I guess you have.
Since when?
I'd like to talk to him.
You're welcome to try. There he is.
You mean that's what you're going to call it.
Didn't you call?
Let me show you something.
I want the rest of the pictures.
This broad hired you, Gittes, not Evelyn Mulwray.
What for?
Gee, thanks, Lou.
Let her go. She didn't kill anybody.
Jake, you're very disturbed. You're crazy. That's her father.
But there is no possibility he would have taken his own life?
He... we did... he wouldn't tell me her name.  We quarreled over her... of course. It came as a complete surprise to me.
A private investigator?
What are you having?
Mrs. Mulwray?
Well, I've been accused of many things, Mrs. Mulwray, but never that.
Look at it this way. Now this phony broad, excuse the language, says she's you, she's hired me. Whoever put her up to it, didn't have anything against me. They were out to get your husband. Now if I see him, I can help him.  Did you talk this morning?
Well, how much would you like?
I was grateful.
Mr. Gittes.
Did he know?
I can't tell you.
What about you? Do you and your father get along?
Easy, it's an innocent question.
Oh that... It's a flaw in the iris...
What does it look like?
Did you have lunch? Kyo will fix you something.
Yes, we've got a 4:30 train to catch. Why?
What are you saying?
She's my daughter.
...so that's why you hate him...
You can't go by train. Escobar'll be looking for you everywhere.
That's worse... Just get out of here. Walk out, leave everything.
Oh yeah? You pick up the watch?
Isn't everybody? What can I do for you, Miss Sessions?
No, Mr. Gittes. Just look in the obituary column of today's Times...
Who?
We understand, c'mon, sweetheart.
He never even kids about it.
I'm sorry, I --
Yeah, must be especially tough to take over under these circumstances.
Yes?
Well, tell you what, pal. If Ida wants to see me she can call me at my office.
Of course not.
Yeah, I'll do that.
I take a long lunch. All day sometimes.
Yes.
How did they get it away from him?
Mr. Mulwray felt the public should own the display. The water. If you'll just read the display.
Mulwray? I thought you said Cross owned the department.
Yes. Yes, they were partners.
Sue people like that they're liable to be having dinner with the Judge who's trying the suit.
But that's what you told your wife.
She ain't exactly long in the tooth now.
She must be about thirty-three, thirty- four.
She ran away?
That's for sure.
Fifty lire... 
Because I don't want to, Toto! This is not a job for you. It's like being a slave. You're always alone. You see the same film over and over again, because you have nothing else to do. And you start talking to Greta Garbo and Tyrone Power like a nut! You work on holidays, on Christmas, on Easter. Only on Good Friday are you free. But if they hadn't put Jesus Christ on a cross...You'd work Good Fridays too!
With time...you get used to it. Besides, when you hear from up here that there's a full house and that people are laughing, having fun... Then you're happy too.  So I've been wasting my breath? You pretend to agree with me, but as soon as my back is turned, you do what you want!  Get out of here! I don't want to lay eyes on you again! This is the last straw! Your mother's right, you're crazy!!  But how'd he do it? The little bastard! By watching, he's learned! It's incredible!  I'm letting the box office know you're not to set foot even into the theatre! There are no more tickets for you! And I'm also talking to Father Adelfio! You won't be an altar boy any more either!!! You little runt! 
Toto, this isn't for you. For the moment, the Cinema Paradiso needs you, and you need the Cinema Paradiso. But it won't last...Some day you'll have other things to do, more important things...  That's right, more important. I know it. Now that I've lost my sight I see more. I see everything I didn't see before...  And it's all thanks to you, who saved my life. And I'll never forget it...  And don't put on that look. I haven't gone off my head yet. You want proof?
Is there a woman?...Tell me the truth...  There is a woman.
What's she like? What's she like?...
What you say is wonderful! But sad...
Don't think about it, Toto. Don't even try. With feelings, there's nothing to understand.
I want to make you happy, Toto! I'm going to tell you a story.  Once upon a time a king gave a feast and there were all the most beautiful princesses of the realm. Basta, one of the guards, saw the king's daughter: she was the loveliest of all! And he immediately fell in love with her. But what could a poor soldier do compared with a king's daughter?!...One day he managed to meet her and told her he couldn't live without her. The princess was so struck by the depth of his feeling that she said to the soldier  'If you will wait a hundred days and a hundred nights beneath my balcony, then in the end I'll be yours.' Christ, the soldier ran off there and waited! One day, two days, ten, twenty...Every night she looked out of her window, but he never budged. Come rain, wind, snow, never budged! The birds shat on him and the bees ate him alive! After ninety nights he was gaunt and pale and tears streamed from his eyes but he couldn't hold them back. He didn't even have the strength to sleep any more. The princess kept watch...And on the ninety-ninth night, the soldier got up, picked up his chair and left!
No particular reason...  Nice day, huh? 
For you to fall in love with me too. Listen carefully. Every night, when I get off work, I'll come and wait beneath your window. Every night. When you change your mind, open your window. That's all. I'll understand...
Don't be silly...I'm old.  Don't look at me like that, please.  Why'd you come back?
Somebody stole it.
What the fuck you talking about? You getting into the act too, Toto? Titanus has trouble giving me even one copy and I have to say thanks! If I ask for two, the least they'll do is cut off my head and play ball with it!
Where is he?
Get me a typewriter.  I'll finish the notice.
Oh!
Two hundred and one thousand, six hundred and forty-seven.
Well, Mr. Bernstein, you were with Mr. Kane from the very beginning -
I'm going back there.
He made an awful lot of money.
You don't say!  Why I had no idea -
Nothing particular the matter with him, they tell me.  Just - 
Who said anything about brooms?
Mr. Bernstein, these men who are now with the "Enquirer" - who were with the "Chronicle" until yesterday - weren't they just as devoted to the "Chronicle" kind of paper as they are now to - our kind of paper?
Go and get yourself washed up, Mr. Bernstein.  There doesn't seem to be an serious injury.
I don't my plans myself.
The "Chronicle" doesn't say she's murdered, Mr. Carter.  It says the neighbors are getting suspicious.
It is accepted, Mr. Carter, with assurances of my deepest regard.
Exactly according to your instructions, Mr. Kane.  We've got two spreads of pictures.
Yes, Mr. Kane.
Thank you.  I can't imagine how Mrs. Kane came to make such a silly mistake.  The sedative Dr. Wagner gave her is in a somewhat larger bottle -  I suppose the strain of preparing for her trip has excited and confused her.
The story about him and Miss Alexander, Mrs. Kane.
Emily -
Emily, you -
If you're asking me to sympathize with him, Brad, you're wasting your time.  There's only one person I'm sorry for, as a matter of fact.  That - that shabby little girl.  I'm really sorry for her, Brad.
Emily - you musn't leave me now - you can't do that to me.
I insist on being told exactly what you have in mind.
No.
You are.  You look like you've been making mud pies.
You're no Venus de Milo.
No.  They've passed on.
I know...  But you do look so silly.
A rooster?
You're getting farther away all the time.  It's a duck.
Is that what you want to do?
I want to be a singer.  I mean, I didn't.  Mother did for me.
That's when you've got to fight them. That's when you've got to make them. That's -
I'll discuss what's on my mind when I want to.  You're not going to keep on running my life the way you want it.
Susan, I really think -
Susan!
I'm going to be elected governor. And the first thing I'm going to do -
I know the facts, Mr. Kane.  And I happen to have the incredible insolence to differ with you as to what they mean.  You're a man of great talents, Mr. Kane.
Not my wife - not either of them.
It's been a tough day.
A wasted day.
Our readers are, anyway, I don't know about the rest of the country.
I mean I've got a job for you.
I'd like that.
Yes?
Why not?  Well - nobody's a great man in your estimation until he's dead.
Look out that window.
I've got to think of Emily -
I'll get you some coffee.
Do you think the "Enquirer" shouldn't have campaigned against the oil leases?
Are you finished?
It's simpler than that, Brad.  A society girl can't stand the gaff, that's all.  Other things are important to her - social position, what they're saying on the front porches at Southampton, is it going to be embarrassing to meet somebody or the other at dinner -
What do you mean by that?
What check?
If I want to, I can go to court. A father has a right to -
It is.  Go on, Mr. Thatcher -
I guess maybe I'm not as hard to see through as I think.  Anyway, I never even answered his letter. Maybe I should have.  I guess he was pretty lonely down there those last years.  He hadn't finished it when she left him - he never finished it - he never finished anything.  Of course, he built it for her -
Sure.
I wonder -  You put all this together - the palaces and the paintings and the toys and everything - what would it spell?
Ask the question anyway, Thompson! Build the picture around the question, even if you can't answer it.
Millions - if anybody wants it.
The last ten years have been tough on a lot of people.
She'll snap out of it.  Why, until he died, she'd just as soon talk about Mr. Kane as about anybody.  Sooner.
It's a picture of a cancer-ridden lung. Keep it.
Do you mind if I drink this here?
Sure. Go ahead.
If you're going to drink it in here, I'd appreciate it if you'd not bother the customers.
Now he's going to launch into his rap about how he's just doing his job; following orders.  Friends, let me tell you about another bunch of hate mongers that were just following orders: they were called Nazis, and they practically wiped a nation of people from the Earth... just like cigarettes are doing now! Cigarette smoking is the new Holocaust, and those that partake in the practice of smoking or sell the wares that promote it are the Nazis of the nineties! He doesn't care how many people die from it! He smiles as you pay for your cancer sticks and says, "Have a nice day."
You want me to leave? Why? Because somebody is telling it like it is? Somebody's giving these fine people a wake-up call?!
Ladies and gentleman, Mrs. Asian Design Major herself: Caitlin Bree!
Few are. So what makes you think you can maintain a relationship with Dante this time around?
Such a sordid state of affair.
I'll try to manage.
Territoriality. He was mine first.
Awww. That was so cute.
Just now.
It's not what you think.
I know, I'm sorry. But when we started talking... it's like I forgot I had a boyfriend. And then he proposed last month...
And you said yes?
Is that what they teach you at that school of yours? Kind of, sort of? Everyone knows about this except me! Do you know how humiliating that is?
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
No, I wasn't. Not really. I told you'd I'd been seeing other people.
We could introduce them. They might hit it off.
The Dante Hicks Dinner and a Movie Date. I think I've been on that one before.
Sang.
You're such an asshole.
I'm not fooling around!  Who went back there?
Um... I don't know.  What time did hockey end?
Just me.
Then who operated the store?
Nobody. It was closed.
Sir! Sir, I'm sorry! He didn't mean it! He was trying to get me.
This doesn't even have Burt Reynolds in it.
Why are the shutters closed?
That's what I said.
Shit, if I'd known you were working, I would've come even later.
Don't screw with it. It makes us look suspicious.
No, thanks.
One fight a day with Veronica is about all I can stomach, thanks.
Seven months.
Five years.
In the middle of it, she calls me Brad.
Oh, my God.
Chess team Allan Harris?!
I'm talking to myself here.
...and she's looking to me for support. And I think that this is leading our relationship to a new level.
All right, Vader's boss...
Yeah.
Something just never sat right with me the second time they destroyed it. I could never put my finger on it-something just wasn't right.
Basically.
So?
Exactly. In order to get it built quickly and quietly they'd hire anybody who could do the job. Do you think the average storm trooper knows how to install a toilet main?  All they know is killing and white uniforms.
All those innocent contractors hired to do a job were killed- casualties of a war they had nothing to do with.  All right, look-you're a roofer, and some juicy government contract comes your way; you got the wife and kids and the two-story in suburbia-this is a government contract, which means all sorts of benefits. All of a sudden these left-wing militants blast you with lasers and wipe out everyone within a three-mile radius.  You didn't ask for that. You have no personal politics. You're just trying to scrape out a living.
Perfect dozen.
You know how much money the average jizz-mopper make per hour?
What's a jizz-mopper?
The jizz-mopper's job is to clean up the booths afterward, because practically everybody shoots a load against the window, and I don't know if you know or not, but cum leaves streaks if you don't clean it right away.
Can you believe this?!
See? There you go again.
I can't believe I'm going to miss the game!
Then where're we gonna play?
"It's not like we're gonna sell out."
Sanford's brother dates her cousin. He found out this morning.
Embolism in her brain. Yesterday.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't she one of the illustrious twelve?
Why not?
One night only. She's buried in the morning.
You hate people.
But I love gatherings. Isn't it ironic?
She meant nothing to you!
I'm going with you.
You just closed the store to play hockey on the roof!
Broke his neck.
I swear.
Come on. Haven't you ever tried to suck your own dick?
Yeah. Like you said, you know. I guess everyone tries it, sooner of later.
I'm telling you, it wasn't my fault!
Does anyone ever knock over a casket on purpose?
Her fucking body fell out!
Just... go! Go open the video store.
I don't want to talk to you.
Let me borrow your car.
Two reasons: one, I hate when the people can't shut up about the stupid tabloid headlines.
I know I'm your hero.
And this is what you rented?
Five hundred dollars.
Really?
Holy shit. That girl?
I'm not. She just left.
You're kidding.
She went home, she's getting ready, and we're going out.
Bunch of savages in this town.  Hey, Caitlin's in the back. You might want to see if she's okay; she's been back there a long time.
I love your sexy talk. It's so... kindergarten: Poo-poo; wee-wee.
I'm stuck in this pit, earning less than slave wages, working on my day off, dealing with every backward fuck on the planet, the goddamn steel shutters are locked all day, I smell like shoe polish, I've got an ex- girlfriend who's catatonic after fucking a dead guy, and my present girlfriend has sucked thirty-six dicks.
You're comfortable. This is a life of convenience for you, and any attempt to change it would shatter the pathetic microcosm you've fashioned for yourself.
Thank you. Why don't you go back to the video store?
It's the same thing with Veronica.
Leave her out of this.
So you'll continue being miserable all the time, just because you don't have the guts to face change?
The swelling's not so bad. But the FDS stings.  How's your neck?
Why the fuck did you tell Veronica that I was going to dump her for Caitlin?
Like ten after.
You wanna grab something to eat tomorrow night... after I get out of here?
I don't have love handles.
You remember Alyssa Jones? She hung out with...
I'm her sister.
Excuse me?
I don't know.
Pretty girl, about this girl's height- dark hair-gorgeous body?
I should start.
Probably saw that Caitlin chick. I know I felt like beatin' it when I saw her.  Come here, bitch! You like this? Is this what you want? Hunhh?
Maybe.
You calling me a liar?
If you'll just tell me the title of your rental choice, I'll have him hold it for you.
Oh... Can I help you?
I'm not asking about the color. I mean is it rough or cottony?
Jesus... go ahead.
I said go ahead.
Here. Now leave me alone.
Please, Veronica. Last thing I need is a lecture at this point.
Somebody jammed the locks with gum.
What were you doing up so late?
Who's fighting? Why are you so defensive?
Theoretically, people see money on the counter and nobody around, they think they're being watched.
I'm astonished to hear you trivialize my role in our sex life.
These are my opinions based on my experiences with the few women who were good enough to sleep with me.
Three.
After dropping a bombshell like that, you owe me. Big.
Unlike you, I have a class in forty- five minutes.
Oh my God-I feel so nauseous...
This is different. This is important. How many?!
I'm going to class.
Thirty-seven. I just can't...
Goodbye, Dante.
Peanut butter and jelly with the crusts cut off. What do you think it is? It's lasagne.
I had to tell someone. He put it into perspective.
...it isn't there. Yes.
You've been talking to her on the phone for weeks!
A couple...?
I'm not the one trying to patch things up with my ex, sneaking around behind your back! And if you think that thirty-seven dicks are a lot, then just wait, mister: I'm going to put the hookers in Times Square to shame with all the guys I go down on now!
Can I have your name please?
I swear to God. Silent Bob, am I lying?
I don't fucking know. What am I, his biographer?  Olaf, what part of Russia are you from?
He's moving to the big city next week. He wants to be a metal singer.
He's got his own band in Moscow. It's called "Fuck Your Yankee Blue Jeans" or something like that.
I like the way you think.
Yo, don't sell all that. 'Cause I'm gonna get the cash and buy it from you at John K's. You're gonna bring it, right?
Twenty bucks.
Cursin'.  That's a penalty kick for unsportsmanlike conduct, mate.
I admit, I can be bought.
I copy.
You do, and the spring thaw is going to be worth a lot of cash!
I love you, too.
Hey, fuck you.
Look, it was a bad time for everybody.
If you want, do it.  I don't care.
Would you?
Not on that leg.
Help me!  I don't want to die!
Just hangin' out.
You couldn't.
Okay, but if you do I'll have to perform resuscitation--
Like I said, I can't turn it off.
If it's alright, I'm gonna pick up the rest of my gear.
Jess--you look good.
That's not the issue here, those people are.  He can't do it alone.
Yeah, let's go.
Excuse me?
Sure, just give it back when you're done.
I've gone this far, and right now I think I'm in better shape than you.
Want me to lead?
If we don't get out of here soon we can ask him in person.
Helluva time for vanity!
Do it, goddammit!
No, he's close, and he's using our money to keep you alive. Nobody's worth that much on the open market.  Except you, the loyal one.  Didn't I tell you to warm the place up?
Anyone else following?
Tucker and Walker, we've lost three bags.
The down drafts would wipe her out.  It's the only chopper.  If it goes, you got no ride out.
Then go fetch.
No names, this is an open line!
Good morning, Walt.
I'd like to have a word with you. This is Agent Matheson, FBI.
What did you do that for?
For being a bastard with no manners and not a dook of an idea how to comport yourself publicwise, O my Brother.
I don't like you should do what you done. And I'm not your brother no more and wouldn't want to be.
I'm sorry to hear about that, sir. His face contorted in rage.
Who are they, sir?
No! No! Don't touch it. That's a very important work of art. What the bloody hell do you want?
Thank you very much, sir.
What would you like to know, sir?
Well, shall we get down to it?
I've got to rest, Mum... got to get fit, otherwise I'm liable to miss a lot more school.
Alright, Mum... have a nice day at the factory.
Hullo love, how are you?  Nice to see you, Dad.
Wrong? Why should you think of anything being wrong, have you been doing something you shouldn't. Yes? He shakes Alex's hair.
I've been doing nothing I shouldn't, sir. The millicents have nothing on me, brother, sir, I mean. Deltoid pulls Alex down on the bed.
Nobody's got anything on me, brother, sir. I've been out of the rookers of the milicents for a long time now.
Do you still feel suicidal?
Um... well, put it this way... I feel very low in myself. I can't see much in the future, and I feel that any second something terrible is going to happen to me. He pitches forward, face into the plate of spaghetti.
Well done, Frank. Julian, get the car, will you please?
The accidental killing of a person, sir.
Fine. Absolutely fine. You see, Ladies and Gentlemen our subject is, you see, impelled towards good by paradoxically being impelled toward evil. The intention to act violently is accompanied by strong feelings of physical distress. To counter these, the subject has to switch to a diametrically opposed attitude. Any questions? Priest rises and moves to Alex.
Thank you, Fred. Thank you. Minister turns and signals. Door opens and a crowd of cameramen and reporters rush in. Aides push two 6-foot loudspeakers and a Hi-Fi on a trolley.
Aye. Glad to see you back, lad.
What about Basil? Where's my snake?
... because I don't like you horrible type, do I, and if you want to start something... if you want to start... go on... well, you just start. Please do. Alex retching.
Fair hair, sir.
No, sir.
No, sir.
No, sir.
Through there for a bath.
I hope so, Missus. She inserts a needle into the medicine vial.
Good. What do you want?
Yes.
How many did I get right?
Yes!!!
Can you... can you spare some cutter, me brothers? Alex rams his stick into the Tramp's stomach. The boys laugh.
Oh - and what's so stinking about it?
Jamey Mack! Be the hokey fly! Holy Mother of God! All the Holy Angels and blessed saints in Heaven preserve us. Alex breaks away but the Tramp toddles alongside him.
No Father. It's nothing like that, Father. It's about this new thing they're all talking about. About this new treatment that you out of prison in no time at all and makes sure you never get back in again.
The question is weather or not this technique really makes a man good. Goodness comes from within. Goodness is chosen. When a man cannot chose, he ceases to be a man.
Have you ever had any attacks of fainting or dizziness?
Very good, Chief. Chief Guard turns to Alex.
It says that you are willing to have the residue of your sentence commuted to the Ludovico treatment. Alex signs. Governor gathers up papers. Alex dots the last "i" and smiles.
Yeah... Pete the English.
Big, big money.
Something to sharpen us up, you especially. We have the start.
We've only just read about it in the morning papers.
Four in this block, sir.
Sixth is a parking lot north of 23rd this time of day.
Let me guess.  Clarinet?
Violin.  I never had the lungs for wind instruments.
Like what?
Travel...and things.
Yeah.
Most of the time.
Like you, I'm good at it.  But at this exact moment in time...like I gotta sumo wrestler on my shoulders until tomorrow morning.
Not in a cab...  I mean a disconnection...get your head straight...you know, get it together...
Sure thing.
Max?  Oh...  ...it's kind of a strange time to be calling...
You sure?  You look pretty shaky...
Was it great?  Better than great, it had to be...
Fella owned this place back then, Dix Dwyer, he let slip to Louis that I played.  So Pops, he just waves me right up.  My heart about stopped. But I got up there all the same, and we played for nearly twenty minutes.
Unbelievable...  ...you hearing this?  Unbelievable.
The crowd was most kind.  I was born in 1945, but my life began the night of July 22, 1964.  That was the moment of my conception.  Right here in this very room.
Wouldn't dream of it.
So?
Oh, right.  The guy flipped out or something?  Killed some people, then put a gun to his own head?
So?  It was a random thing.
Cabbie had no criminal record, no history of mental illness.  Suddenly, he just wigs out and pops three people, then himself?  Plus the victims weren't random solid citizens. They were all lowlives.  Wiseguys.  I've always wondered if there was someone else in the cab.
Elvis?
Something big's going down, and I'm betting the Feds don't know about it. You gotta get us in there.
No harm done, ma'am.
Tell my son.  You have to hold a gun to his head to get him to come see me.
Max never had many friends.  So much with the piano.  Always keeping to himself, it's unhealthy...
Of course!
You're gonna cheer up.
I give a shit whose fault it was, you're payin'!
...everything is not about me, don't make me the villain here.  That asshole was out of line, and you goddamn well know it...
You share it with over three million people every day.  You know that's the population of New Zealand?  What's Manhattan, thirteen miles long? That's a lot of misery crammed into thirteen miles.  Read about this one guy.  Gets on the subway and dies.  Six hours he's riding around before anybody notices. Think about that.  Here's this corpse doing laps around Manhattan courtesy of the New York transit system, people getting on and off, sitting next to him, and still nobody catches on. Three million.  That's too damn many people.
People are more relaxed.  Less stress, less traffic, better tips.
It's not that kind of job.
None taken.  There are talkers and doers.  I like doers.
You always stutter?
No-no, I-I shot him.  The bullets and the fall killed him.
It's just a dead guy.  On three, ready?  Uno.  Dos.  Three.
How long, you figure?
Play music.
I should only kill people after I get to know 'em?  Six billion people on the planet, you're getting bent out of shape 'cause of one fat guy?
Good luck.  You think they got families?
Why?
I need the job.
No you don't.
I'm...what?  Sorry?
That what we're doing?  Flowing?
You're the one who keeps talking about going with the flow.  You like the man, you like the way he plays.  How about a little jazz, huh?
<u>I don't wanna know you!</u>
There's no way I'm taking you to see my mother!
You'd do her a favor.
In case <u>who</u> checks?
Dmitri?
The man who hired me for this contract.
We've both run out of options.  If it helps, take comfort in knowing you never had a choice.
I shoulda saved him 'cause he <u>believed</u> you?
That's what you said...
That's the "why."  That's the why? There is no reason.  No good reason; no bad reason.  To live or to die.
Flip was a hero in Vietnam.
Testing some top secret seismic weapon.
You don't have to burst in here every time, Jerry.  Just call and make an appointment.
Don't tell me you're naked back there.
Oswald was an assassin.  You're not an assassin, are you, Jerry?
If you're worried about the President, call and warn him about the Space Shuttle.
Them who?
People more serious about their work. You know how to drive this thing or do you just like looking good in it?
Six months.  Eleven days.
This would be it?
It made me feel like you could see inside of me.  And I don't know how that's possible.
You run with your back to the picture.  Like you were trying to get away.  Once in awhile you sing along with music, but mostly you punish yourself.
I'll be fine.  Let's worry about Henry Finch.  P.O. Box in St. Louis.  He's the last on the list. I haven't been able to reach him yet.
Maybe you better not try... I worked so hard to keep quiet. Like a mouse.  I should have realized.
Cold War's over, Jerry.
Murdered?
Nobody dies in Newport.  They couldn't even kill Sunny von Bulow there.  Harriman drowned, but it wasn't in Newport.
They're big details, Jerry.
If you were eating Kentucky Fried Chicken and drinking Coca-Cola again.
Yeah...  Would you, I mean, could you love me then?  If I was normal.  Maybe?
Don't do this to yourself.  Jerry. You don't love me.
It would be a lot easier for me to show you instead of tell you.  But first things first.
Where are we going, Jerry?
Come on.
Is that what they told you?
Can't give you the details because I can't remember.  I went to court to kill him.  At the Ezekiel Walters hearing.  I was supposed to shoot him at the press conference.  You were there. That's the first time I saw you.
You do?
They'll trace it.
I spent two years here.  This used to bring the med-cart.  Demerol. Phenobarb.  It's Jacob's Ladder.
What about you?
That's ironic.  Because we're here to protect her from you.
Then screw you.  I'll rot.
It was my dog.  Let me ask you a question.  How long have you been acquainted with Jerry?
A charming term.  Now, <u>why him</u>?
Fine.  What the hell is going on?
If I had any idea what to charge you with or how to prove it, I'd arrest you right here.
And what did I say?
Do you <u>have</u> an Agent Lowry in your New York office?
Agent Lowry?
It's his show for now.  Look, you want to get some dinner?  Inter- Agency cooperation and all?
Your call.  Have a good night.
There is no abort procedure -- we don't know how we turned the damn thing on, let alone how to turn it off.
How is that possible?  How could all that information be encoded in --
Still settling in, really.  Where's Dr. Arroway?
So?
Very well; since my appointment he's been made interim director.
No doubt.
Then why haven't you detected any signals?  If, as you claim, there have been thousands, millions of advanced civilizations out there for millions of years then why hasn't one signal gotten through?  It'll take a month or two for the paperwork to go through; you're welcome to stay until then.
David --
It was a worthy experiment -- worthy of you; I was wrong about that part. But it's over now.
It's hardly yesterday; the signal's been traveling for over twenty-six years.  As for why...  I'm hoping your own expertise in decryption algorithms will help us find out -- to see if there's another message buried deeper in the signal.
You were right, Ellie.  You were right all along.
Ellie... you should know that I'm no longer the President's Science Advisor.
Maybe they are.  Maybe this is all part of the package.  The building of the machine has demanded international cooperation on an unprecedented scale.  Maybe requiring us to come together in this way was, in effect, part of the plan.
What would you have me say, David?
Well --
Maybe it'll be at the end of the data when the message recycles.
Nice.  Where?
Never seen the optical sky myself, but I hear it's nice too.
And current theory holds that to sustain the sort of wormholes you're talking about, even for a fraction of a second, would require more energy than our sun produces in a year, is that correct?
Just be yourself, Captain.  Find out where he is.
Could we hear to the moon?
So.  Are you an hallucination?  Or are little gear trains and circuit boards under your skin?
Originally just another species like yourselves.  Well, not like you at all actually, but...
And they all travel here through this wormhole subway system you built.
Can you help us?
So.  What happens now?
That isn't the way it works.
I find it convenient to keep my interests... mobile.  Anyway, I've had my fill of life on the ground. After spending much of this century pursuing the evils and pleasures the world has to offer -- after outliving three wives and two children...  I find I've had quite enough of planet Earth.
A page-break signal.  A period.
-- even if he doesn't receive the entire transmission.  Heaven is the mustard seed.
What are you talking about?  It's over.
Oh, not quite yet.  At least for their sake...  ... I hope it's not.  Because they're running out of time.
Can't.  Doctor's orders.  The low oxygen/zero gravity environment is the only thing keeping the cancer from eating me alive.  It's all right -- I like it here. Ever try sex in zero-G?
It's like the pre-Copernicans who swore the sun revolved around the Earth, or the Victorians at the end of the last century who concluded that all major discoveries had now been made.  I mean... try to imagine civilization a thousand years ahead of us -- then imagine trying to explain... I dunno, a microwave oven -- to someone even a hundred years ago -- I mean the basic concepts didn't exist...
'... is indistinguishable from magic.'
Thirty-one linked dishes.  You could search more sky there in a day than you could in a year here.
But the machine worked -- that's what I've been trying to tell everyone!  The tape -- it's all there, if they'd just look at...  ... the tape...
So if I let the pendulum go, when it swings back you wouldn't flinch.
I don't think so.
If you came back... you'd only be four years older -- but over 50 years would have passed on Earth.
I'm more interested in the story behind the story... How a young man goes from living on the streets of South Boston to being the best- selling media figure rubbing elbows with the President.
And yet you're willing to die for this cause, the one thing that's given your life a sense of purpose. Don't you see the contradiction here -- ?
I want to, Palmer -- more than anything.  But it has to be real. It has to be true.
Something my dad -- they -- said. 'After all the suffering, after all the desolation of the void -- the one thing that makes the vastness tolerable is each other.'  The one thing that makes it bearable is love.
I question the thinking behind sending the first ambassador to another civilization in armed -- basically announcing our intentions are hostile.
But I made this arrangement --
You never thought that's a heavy load?
No.
I don't know, Boss.
It ain't my fault you don't know how to handle your dogs.
I guess you could say I wasn't thinkin', Captain.
Well, you got yourself some time now. Two years. Hell, that ain't much, we got coupla men here doin' twenty spots. We got one who's got all of it. We got all kinds and you gonna fit in real good. Course in case you git rabbit in your blood and decide to take off fer home, you git a bonus a some time and couple leg chains to keep you slowed down a little -- fer your own good. You'll learn the rules. It's all up to you. I can be a good guy or I can be one mean son-of-a-bitch, it's up to you.
You jes' watch us!
What happened? How far did you get?
I'm dyin'. I'm dyin'.
I thought you knew, boy... they sentenced me by the mile.
Innocent?
Yeah, well, you and Koko kin handle it without me.
Luke, you got to listen to me. All you got to do is just give up nice and quiet, just play it cool.
Come on, boy, come on, darlin'. You kin do her. Just let that ol' belly sag and enjoy itself. Stay loose, buddy. Eight more, between you and everlasting glory. Little ol' eggs, pigeon eggs, that's all, fish eggs practically.
Your Luke's got more guts than brains.
Bet! Babalugats, bet here!
Cuter.
I know he's got a paira kings. He don't have to stick 'em in my ear.
Damn.
Give in? That's our Luke out there.
Would you please get your hands off my face, Tallulah?  What happened to the newspaper?
He whispered, but it was <u>him</u>!  I know it was him!
Andy?
Oh, God, I forget.  Yes.  Yes.  You go.  Poor thing, you ought to get out.
I know.  Do come and meet your guest.
Hal has it.
Oh, God, uniforms, more stress. Let her sleep.  It's a self-limiting: she hyperventilates till she passes out, then her breathing goes back to normal, and she wakes up singing like a lark.  We know, don't we, Princess?  Give her a couple of hours.  I know about this.
Tell her about <u>what</u>?
And you believed him when he told you he had done that.
Yes.  I believed him.
No, that's still in my jacket I was wearing.  We were supposed to meet on the docks, that number 47 wharf, 10 o'clock Friday.  He's gonna hand me 500 bucks.
Where is it?
She's supposed to have it.
I don't care -- she's a cop.  That's the important thing.  Cop-ness, not sex-ness.  It won't be perfect, but it'll be good.
You know where.
Where it began -- McCluskey Auditorium.
No.  Not yet.
Do it.  If that's what all this carnage is about, then do it.  Have enough guts to do it.
You're calling me a crank?
Is he out?
Yes, I did.  Poor impulse control. The accounts of the firs two murders made it so clear they were the work of the same man, but you kept announcing they were unrelated.  You'll never catch him that way.
Would you want to work with us on this?
<u>He</u> won't.
I don't look at pictures.  I look at the <u>real thing</u>.  I don't feel infected.
Maybe that's why you can't catch him.  I <u>know</u> what she looks like -- the red-headed woman in my computer.
But it's a different m.o.
Then what do you need me for?
She was killed somewhere else and dumped outdoors in an empty lot. Where it says "no dumping."  Her legs pulled apart in a kind of sexual pose.   It's all different but it seems so -- the same. Artificial and <u>posed</u>... Something's wrong with it.
So far nothing they test for comes up positive.
Injected Windex!  Why would he switch to a new m.o.?
Ah, if you knew that, you'd be half way to nailing him.  Serial killing is irrational and rigid and compulsive.  This guy has a plan all thought out, flexible and complex.  He's playing a game with us.  Who will he imitate next? Maybe he's doing all the serial killers in history, the great innovators, the murderers' hall of fame.  Just to prove he's better than all of them.  They got caught; he didn't.
You betrayed me!  Now every psychopath in the city knows I'm back in business... You lied to me!
Why should I trust you?
A man?  I thought he was a boy.  This last Christmas was the happiest Christmas I had in the last ten years... you know why?  It was the first Christmas in six years I was not in love.  Son of a bitch <u>married men</u>!  Who cares about marriage, the bed just gets crowded and noisy?!
Where's the john?  Let me clean up this mess, and get back to work.
Look.  There's the order:  you wrote it:  DeSalvo, Bianchi & Buono, Berkowitz and Dahmer.  It's going to be Dahmer next.  Which means he'll kill a man.
He can get into my computer any time he likes!  This is exactly the kind of thing I didn't want to have happen.
No.  I'm shy and I'm selective.
Listen to me.  Is there a gas station nearby?
Oh, I know.
Yeah, but she had divine guidance.
You know, M.J., when I watch you shoot, I realize I've got a little problem with my stance... could you just move over here and critique my legs?
It's mostly done, they got nobody in common, the three of them... No mutual friends -- the Landlady says nobody was ever there, she never saw her with anybody.
You came in there with this attitude...
Nada.  Lemme make the call.
Honest to God, Ruben!
How about I put Nikko on it?
Yessir.  I have reflected on that, sir.  Which explains my gushing deference to you, sir.
Christ.  How old are you?  You sure you want to be in this line of work?
Okay, now what about your sidekick punching my favorite detective? What the hell is going on?  You got no discipline in your operation.
You got a suspect...
How'd you get in on the deal?
Nikko?
So I'm maybe gonna lose three good cops?  You fucked up on this occasion, but don't be so hard on yourself.  There's something I want you to think about.  The book says if you use your gun, use it to kill, that's what it's meant to do. You tried to pick this punk off with fancy shooting, to keep him alive.  To what end?  You're not willing to kill, you can't be a cop.  Go get drunk.  I am.
No, she can come in tomorrow... gonna want to know a lot of things...
I just got here.  Talk to you later...
Don't give me six years!  You never divorced Patty, did you?  So what'd you expect from M.J.?
Why don't we save it for later? It's almost time for Letterman.
Yes, I fed her.  If she says she's hungry, she's lying to you.  Again.
She lies all the time.  Why would I say I fed her if I didn't?
That's what I don't know.  Why would you lie?  That's the problem... I can't understand why anyone would lie.
And her husband? What was he?
Outside in the visitors, car park.
What!? They brought the car here?
I wish I had. They bury the dead so quickly - they should leave them lying around for months.
You're not envious?
No. But when he's in that car...
We sat in B massive traffic jam under an off-ramp. I don't think we moved more than fifty yards.  I'm thinking of taking up a new job with the Road Research Laboratory. They need a medical officer. The salary is larger something I've got to think about now. There's a certain moral virtue in being materialistic, I'm beginning to feel. Well, it's a new approach for me, in any case.
A complimentary ticket for a special stunt-driving exhibition. Definitely not part of the big auto show. There's a map in the packet and a note requesting you be discrete about the location.
Really? What kind of exhibition is it?
No, thanks. I'll go with Vaughan.
Is that why you drive this car? I take it that you see Kennedy's assassination as a special kind of car-crash?
What?
I don't think you understand.    I won't wait.
I'm a grown woman, Dr. Emlee.   I can take care of myself.
Oh?
What's the matter?
Sage, rosemary...  Les Herbes.
Loaned you. And it's only 'til you get out of here.
Will you get time off to do that?
Especially with a promotion in the offing.
Just think, pretty soon, we'll be doing all these wedding preparations for you.  Of course, if that's what you still want. Ruthie told me some silly story about a crush on some boy here.
Mom, look, if I want to dump Paul, I'll dump him. If I want to screw Michael or live with him or marry him, then I'll do that.
I've already made arrangements.
A deal's a deal.
There's a spider in my room.
I guess so. I think that's right.
No.
I've already checked it out 17 times.
Exactly.
I had to sneak by the guards to get here. They say you're highly unstable, have a depressive personality, and may hold back my own recovery.
I'm starting to think that everyone's crazy to some extent.
Break up?    They wish.
Your family just met me.
I do.
Home free.
Yeah.
So, it's over?
Open up.    I want to see.
Let's try out the bed.
I love your apartment.
It's sex time.
Shhhh.
Would you mind if we just called it an early night?
Forget I asked.
Maybe you ought to see a doctor.
I hope you like it. It's a Marquis cut, 1.5 carats. They had one with emeralds around it, but this was simpler, more classic in its lines.  Letty?
He's a patient here.
I love him.
No way. You keep the ring.     You'll come to your senses.
Oh.
I start on Monday.
What?
I heard your friend was back in the hospital.
I know, Letty. But the incident with Zach was frightening for the children.  Now if you'd come to me, explained what was going on...
Do you know who this is?
You think I'm going to talk to you until I know if you're wired.
I thought you wanted Zammito?
You're there now?
The job is worth about two million euros. Pull this off and you and your crew could make some real money, Daniel. You leave tomorrow.
Mr. Maranzano sends his warmest regards.
-- Super what?
Yeah -- you do that.
Uh, no --
He missed three weeks.
But you were there?
Half the tapes.
And the other half?
You have something for me?
What kind of business?
I agree with Marcel. I say we go to the airport and get on a plane.
You didn't buy batteries?
No.
Good idea.
No?
Don't bullshit me.
I can see that. The man's car you stole. Raphael Ruiz. He's head of the 19th Street gang and one crazy motherfucker. And Frankie Zammito's got the word out he's looking for some French dudes. You're French ain't ya?
If I knew where they were you wouldn't have to find them, would you?
Yeah. I'll come down and make a full confession later. Right now, tell me what else you found?
Oh yeah.
Okay.    I will have a beer.
Stop talking. I'm trying to concentrate.
I don't know.     It's gotta be millions.
Give it to me, Sami.
Get in the car.
Although a cartoon I feel he shares a universal theme: We are all searching for love. No?
I'm more of a whiskey drinker myself.
And you don't speak French?
What does arresting us get them?
I've been thinking about getting tattoo. You know, a flower or something. On my ass.
The lucky ones.
You gonna forget about the money I owe you?
It's for you.
How's the arm?  Still sore?
I'm looking for someone.  Jade Fox. I'm a police inspector from Shaan Xi, Gen Su district.  Jade Fox is a master criminal.  I hear she infiltrated the Yus.  She must have come with them when they transferred here.  But with Yu's reputation, I can't just go in and accuse her.
This Jade Fox is a woman?
Stop talking like a monk!  Just fight!
Real sharpness comes without effort.
They wouldn't have found me if you hadn't stolen the sword.  Like a little girl, you thought stealing would be fun?  You, too, are responsible for that death.  Come with me.  You don't want to waste your life as the wife of some bureaucrat.  Denied your talent... As a master and disciple we will rule.
Don't bother.
I've made you silk pajamas.  Do you want to change into them?
Go to bed then.  Miss has grown up, and is getting married soon.  God knows what the future will bring.
You're too young to understand.
Sure.  No place to bathe for days, sleeping in flea-infested beds... They tell you all about that in those books?
So I heard.  Congratulations.  It's the most important step in a woman's life, isn't it?
No!  You couldn't roam around freely if you were.
Thank you for seeing me.  I hear your wedding day is near.  You must be overwhelmed by the preparations.
I am not an aristocrat, as you are... but I must still respect a woman's duties.
Then as a sister, let me wish you happiness in your marriage.
Yes, from the West.  He went undercover and and followed her here,
They forced me to marry!
Let's end this here.
With all the traffic on your rooftop these days... it took me a while to get in here.  I can't wait any longer.  I was wrong to let you go.  Come back with me.  You'll be happy in the desert.  You'll be free there.
You coward!
Yes.
The mountain must be so peaceful... I envy you.  My work keeps me so busy, I hardly get any rest.
Too many men have died at its edge. It only looks pure because blood washes so easily from its blade.
So what will you do now?
I wish there were something more I could do to help you.
No mercy will be shown toward the murderer who turned up in Peking.
Yes.  The very killer of Li Mu Bai's own master.  Last night, she killed a policeman who had tracked her down.
All right.  I'll act as the sword's custodian.
Don't be coy.  I've always known about your feelings for each other. All these years, it's a shame... neither of you is brave enough to admit the truth to the other. You're both wasting precious time.
What do you have in mind?
Who ever made that.
No further.  I'm serious.
It's only a flesh wound.
We'll discuss this later. Obviously.  You left the door open.
Mister Funboy lives there?
Does she have a name?
No name.  You sure ask a lot of questions.
You mean you'll, like' dig your way out of the grave?  Euww.
Take the dope, too.
That's ancient history.
Rowdy.  Let me fill in some gaps for you.
I ain't got no fuckin' ring.
Magic.
Yeah, I got a more fun idea myself.
Does it hurt?!  You dead-ass, clown-faced fuck, of course it fucking hurts!  What the shit are you gonna do about this?!
Interested?  Follow the crow.
You need to learn to mind your own business or you'll never get where you think you're going.
The night is young.
That's right.
I'll be fine.
Well, I'll leave you alone now. I just came in here to get something of mine.
You heard me.
I know.
What do you mean?
From who?
Now it's my job to look out for you. You're like a kid sister to me. Do I look like some kind of gossip queen?
Most people are morons. I mean who are you to knock what you've never experienced?
How do you know I've been with several women?
Well maybe you should get to know the person before you judge them instead of listening to some bullshit gossip.
Look, I've got a lot of problems and I'm trying to deal with them and the last thing I need is people spreading shit about me.
You talking to me?
You've read The Fountainhead?
You need help.
I wasn't kidding. I'd like to take you out.
Because you act like a pig.
You don't find me cute? Come on, look at these muscles.
How are you today?
How about tonight?
Tell me what to do, Annette. How can I win your heart. I'll do anything. I can't get you out of my mind.
Wait, don't hang up.
It's not about winning. You know what your problem is? You take yourself way too seriously.
I know. I wish I felt the same. Unfortunately, I feel nothing. I think it was just the conquest. Sorry, I'm completely fucked up.
You don't even know me. The fact of the matter is there is some one I love. She's smarter, prettier... you don't even compare to her. The only reason I am here is because she wants us to be exclusive.
Thanks.  Nice meeting you.
Do you want to learn or not?
Eyes closed.
Is it that obvious?
You'd do that for me?
It involves your brother. He... took advantage of me.
Why didn't you do something?
He made you give him a blow job.
Well... I don't know - it was weird. At first it felt icky, then it felt kind of okay. Then, I started getting really hot and then I started shaking and then like, I don't t know... it felt like an explosion, but a good one.
But I thought high school is only four years.
Mmmm, you're right. Those clothes don't do you justice. Why don't you take them off.
I want to go home.
And then I can go home?
Good night Cecile.
Well, you don't have to get nasty about it.
Get out of here.
Yes!
I don't know. Why don't you leave her alone.
I told you I don't know.
He doesn't scare me. I'll kick his ass in.
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer. When I get through with her, she'll be the premier Blow Job Queen of the Tri-State area and poor little Court's heart will be shattered.
Because if there's an attack made on Court it could be traced back to me. I can't allow that to happen. Everybody loves me and I intend to keep it that way.
Oh but diddling the therapist's daughter is a challenge?
B.F.D. What do you plan to do? Fly to Kansas and woo little Dorothy.
Be more specific.
In English.  I'll fuck your brains out.
What makes you think I'd go for that bet? That's a seventy thousand dollar car.
Call Cecile up and get her to come over. I'll bust that cherry in a heartbeat.
Ooo, I'm sure Mrs. Caldwell will love that.
I hate it too.
Any day now.
Yeah.
Do you mind if I take my new Porsche for a ride?
Morning.
Where is she?
She wouldn't say. She apologized to your aunt and told her she was going to stay with some friends.  You blew it, Sebastian. That girl has come to her senses and she will never go near you again.
Kind of.
It was... Fantastic.
No, tell me.
I want to fuck.
At first it was, but now it's become something bigger.
Ronald?
Come again?
It's Cecile.
What about her?
She's out.
Later. Listen, we're entertaining some guests so -
Uh huh. You beat me three times.
I did?
Do you mind if I check upstairs?
Kathryn? Oh Christ, she got to you too?
Wouldn't it be just the same, darling, if daddy dropped the present at Mrs. Farren's on his way to town tomorrow morning?
Yes, darling,
Gosh, in my day kids arrived at birthday parties before anybody was ready for them,
I'm not shouting at you, but there's no doubt in my mind that you spoil this child!
That's the Farren house.
But this is different.  Go on blow,
Yes, darling.
I'm your friend.
Will you be friend for always?
For as long as you'll let me.
I shall want you for always.
Oh, I like the sound of that.., Amy and her friend... Amy and her friend.
Yes, yes! I see Prince,
That's right!
light shining) in her eyes) Throw sea weeds into the flames, and the fire turns blue!
Oh, but the winter's fun. There's the wind and the snow. You'll like the warm fire upon the hearth, and the long, long nights.
Oh, that is more beautiful than I ever imagined it!  I wish I could show you to mommy and daddy.  I wish you could enjoy Christmas with us.
A merry Christmas to you, Amy.
I want to touch it.
A lady threw it to me.
Oh, I suppose it was to the wind you sang, or maybe to the sun, or the clouds, or maybe it was to the flowers in the garden.
I do suppose so. But if you were there yesterday, guess you can get there today.
Probably hit by a car. Hard to see things in the twilight.
The ring? We'll have no more nonsense about the ring.
The storms have done everything they can to me, I don't hate them. I don't even hear the wind. It blows beyond me. It was on such a night as this that Barbara died.
Yes...yes, that's true.
Now, I don't know Amy --

Indeed I did. Up and down the garden she went, laughing and singing to herself.
Can we get some service here?
Yul Brynner. They're all dead.
Anything's better than Mark.
I get a little bloated sometimes.
They better. Of course, trouble is, you never know what they'll expect for it. You gotta know what to order, and what you're willing to do. Like if a guy spends a fortune on you, he's gonna feel like you owe him something.
Rule one: always wear make-up.
You're at his place, and you come out of the bathroom looking all shy and say, "I'm so embarrassed but could you run out and get me some tampons?" If he says no, he's too embarrassed, then you know he's a wus. If he says he's got some in the bathroom, then you know there are other women around a lot. But if he says yes and goes to get you tampons, well then he's a decent guy. Then, while he's out...
You have to stop being so self- critical Frida.
We almost slept together... and... then the hair started and I booked.
Great. George is meeting Carlton first for drinks. We can meet and go together. It'll be a blast.
Shit, I guess I missed work.
Oh no.
Yeah, I guess. Mark?
You're cheating on George? Jennifer, how could you?
You say murder, but you have no idea what happened. You don't remember doing it, so it's out of your control.
We don't know you're a werewolf. It might never happen again. You have to get on with your life.
Yes, just check on me once a day for the next three days. Then the PMS should be over.
I do development for TV movies.
No, I'm serious. How about we have dinner and I tell you about it?
That's great. Highly original.
My apartment's just such a mess.
No.
You haven't even paid me back the thousand bucks you owe me!
I'm working on it...
Okay, if you think of anything else, please give us a call.
It's stupid.
I've had time to get over it. She was killed by wolves they think.
The weird thing is I've had an odd, morbid fascination with wolves ever since.
My period? No.
Frida, wait. Don't go. We can just sleep. I just want to wake up with you.
Uh... the buzzer's broken. I'll be down in a second.
He was ripped to shreds also. In his apartment.
I'm staying here with you tonight. There's no getting rid of me.
No way can anything be proved. All they have are some wolf hairs. No one believes in werewolves.
I'm so sorry... I... I couldn't help it. You know I didn't mean to... to do any of that.
You say you killed a man and don't remember it. Couldn't you have had sex and not remember it? It's sexual. Why did you choose "eating him" as the method of killing?
Oh my god, what happened?
She's just so... pathetic.
She'll talk about PMS and stare at her salad.
She's my best friend. I gotta be there for her -- no matter how crazy it sounds. I've been in some bad relationships and she's been there for me. She's lonely. If pretending she's a werewolf helps, then more power to her.
We can just take this pillowcase.
That dude was torn limb from limb. No way a woman like that could have done it. You never seen blood on a chick's sheets from her period?
Hey, there was a lot of blood.
She was never a suspect Lloyd. Some animal must have done this.
Hairy women are kind of sexy. Women in their natural state.
Yeah okay. I still say Frida's involved. She's the last one to see two dudes alive...
Hard to tell. Looks like he's been cleaned up and he's decomposing as we speak. This case gets weirder by the minute.
He tried to kill me!
Really?  And how is his state of mind?
Yes, of course.  Everything's fine...
You are mistaken.
Sheís getting better, thanks.  She...
You wonít regret this, sir.
All the important stuff.  Wrap it up for me.
What?
No...  No doctor...
Shut up, freak!  Monster!  You are insignificant.
You think I haven't been trying!  It's like there was never anything there.  Just water.
Asks my name.  Over and over.  Just like a broken record.  Only thing is, I can't answer.  I've no idea what my name <u>is</u>.
You remember nothing, eh?  Let me show you something.
Not that again...
Why?
We are...  living in their dreams...
Of course you are.  You couldn't do those terrible things.  Come home with me  -  maybe things will make sense then...
That's easy.  You...
Great.
No...
Look... at some point we're going to have to call the Vice President...
Don't call the Vice President!
Well, start by going on television and saying that he's had a mild stroke...
Yes - - and that he ought to be up and around sometime soon.
Her?... Oh -- the First Lady...  She was giving that commencement speech up in Bryn Mawr.  I managed to catch her before she left the hotel.
And...
I told her his blood pressure went up after a little incident at  `the hotel.' She seems to hate him more than ever.
Clean.
Clean.
Remember that First Liberty stuff we almost got nailed on?
And look at this.  Russell came around on the trade bill.
I'm going to kill him.
Well, I didn't mean it, Alan. Why the fuck would I want to save a homeless shelter?
Then we'll all go to jail together.
... But as I began to investigate, I realized that this pattern of corruption extended much higher...
They could put you in jail.
I'm not sure.
I'm not surprised.  Can we save anywhere?
Now,  let's say the whole country. Was in that car.   The entire United States of America.
Oh.
That's at a press conference. Otherwise he just puts `em right out there.
We vetoed that?
You're spending forty-three million dollars on an ad campaign to...  'Boost consumer confidence in the American auto industry.'
Perceptual?
I just fired Bob Alexander.
We'd like to hire you.
Huh.  You know what I always wondered the way they say you guys'd take a bullet for the President.
I had a feeling.
You're kidding.
The Vice-President...
Well...
I'm outta here.
Oh... Yeah.
I don't know.
I don't mind.
Yes.
It's just more than anybody else does around here.
Well don't get carried away -- I'm not that good at it.
Hi.
It'll be on the teleprompter with the rest of the speech.
Oh yeah.  Did you take care of later on?
And if I don't? If I don't you'll come back after your death. You'll come back and find yourself hanging there...wanting to eat...needing to eat human flesh. You hate that thought, don't you? That's the ultimate sin for most of you fools, isn't it?
Leave him.
gonna change, young lady. Now if you still got a statement you'd like ta make, you can jus' hold onto it 'til tonight.
We thought we were escaping here. We thought we'd found an uninhabited island. Christ! This place is a worse nightmare than anything I've seen yet!
That's why we didn't use prayers on this here white coat 'til after he was destroyed. We ready to fight when we have to. And we gotta fight now.
Look. I BEEN fightin', mister. I been fightin' for what feels like a hundred years and I'm finished. I don't need religion. I don't need prayers. I need a couple guns and a couple hands. We can sail on outa here. Find another island where there ain't so much....traffic.
Datura! Miguel knew it! Datura, he was shouting! Datura Metel!
Come on. Let's go.
You are dying, too.
God....damn you, Rhodes!
Sir, Tyler is innocent of any crime against the State. Captain Rhodes is...
We're both gonna leave. Leave the island. I've been talkin' to Tricks. We think we can smuggle out one of those inflatable rafts. They're crated up real small. They've got air canisters. There's food inside. Even a little motor.
Women swoon!
Meeks, you're the brain here.  What do the dead poets say about somebody like me?
So much the better.
I'm sorry.  I, we
Miss it?  It drives us crazy.  That's part of what this club is about.  In fact, I'd like to announce that I've published an article in the school paper, in the name of the Dead Poets society, demanding girls be admitted to Welton, so we can all stop beating off.
This is better than sex any day.  This is romance!
Good.  We're very excited about him.  He was a Rhodes Scholar, you know.
what?!
It's only me, Mr. Nolan.  I swear. I made it up.
Well, Meeks aced Latin and I didn't quite flunk English so if you want, we've got our study group.
Sure, but Cameron asked me too.  Anybody mind including him?
You're welcome to join us, Todd.
Hey, would you not worry about your precious little necks?  If they catch me, I'll tell them I made it up.  All your asses are safe.  Look, Gloria and Tina didn't come here to listen to us argue. Are we gonna have a meeting or what?
It's better than doing nothing.
You know,
Hello Chris, this is Knox Overstress.
But, Chris...
Knox, why are you doing this to me?
You can't be in here.
God, if Chet found out he'd...
My Word
They perpetuate mechanical living, sir. They limit your mind.
I always thought education was learning to think for yourself.
Don't stop!
Nothing wrong with research.
Mr. Keating, my father is making me quit the play at Henley Hall.  When I think about carpe diem and all that, I feel like I'm in prison!  I mean, I can see his point.  We're not a rich family like Charlie's.  But he's planned the rest of my life for me and he's never even asked me what I want!
Eighteen!  That's two years!  What about the play?  The performance is tomorrow night!
Isn't there an easier way?
Not if you're going to stay true to yourself.
But she's in love with: the moron son of my father's best friend.  What would the dead poets say about that?
Then you can help him.
God, I want to do everything!  I'm going to explode.
Good luck.
Did you really think I wouldn't find out?!  "My niece is in a play with your son," Mrs. Marks says.  "You must be mistaken," I say.  "My son isn't in a play."  You made a liar out of me, Neil! Now you will go tomorrow and tell them you are quitting.
Nothing.
what?
Yes, and acting!  It's got to be one of the most wonderful things in the world. Most people, if they're lucky, live about half an exciting life! If I could get the parts, I could live dozens of lives.
Lots of girls.  The girl who plays Hermia is incredible.
We have to make it to the third deck...
What the hell are you talking about?
I saved your life is what I did!
Who asked you to!
Since I'm a kid, I had this dream... I want to own my own tropical island... Beaches, warm ocean, lots of food, little clothes...population of one...
You're saying they can think?
The quiet...
A meat locker.
What?
This time, make an exception.
Why don't you just stop figuring and keep working so we can get the hell out of here?
You don't give a shit about anything do you?
That's it? That's all you give a shit about?
...Like a house in the suburbs... maybe a couple of kids...some sort of business...be in the bowling league...go to the ball games...
I'm stuck...
If I don't, I ain't going back to get it...you think we're safe?
Those are mine!
You want 'em?
You just put mustard on your Hershey bar.
Who's going?
Nick...?  Jesus, Nick!
What do you think? You think he's been picking flowers? Fuckin' guy's been saving your ass, Albert. Everybody's ass! Even in Europe!
You gotta hit it here. Here, Albert, not there.
Jesus!
Nick...
Yeah.
But you must come in.
You call me Linda, just like home.
Too bad.
Yeah?
Yeah?
Not so good.
Linda, Linda...!
Will you marry me?
Would you?
What kind of beer would you like?
No.
That was nothing. That wasn't anything.
It was just the complications. I mean, you take a little thing over there and then you get complications. I mean all the guys had it.
Great. Fine... Once or twice it did fall off the blocks. I don't know what that's from.
Sal... listen to me, Sal! You have to do it.
Yeah.
You do?
You have to think about the shot. It's the shot. The shot's it.
Well, where's he from?
From Nam?
Huh?
Hunt with Vince?
Forget Sal... Listen to me -- forget Sal! I've been working on Sal since dawn, Nick. Sal's in a dream and he won't come out. LISTEN!!! From here on you gotta go for you. You hear me? For you!
Merle...
With more bullets?... Against each other?... Are you crazy!!! Are you fucking nuts!!!
When you get the AK, open up. You got me? Open up.
Merle... Hey, Merle, listen...  Why?
Then lemme have 'em.
Just forget that. Forget what it says in the book.
What's that noise?
Listen, Nick --
What?
It's okay. Hey, it's okay! Just a week. Just to see Phantom Mary.
No.
You loaded it, Vince! I saw you!
Down ribbon!
Witnesses say some wacko went Judge hunting with a late model.  I got an artist working on a computer composite now.
This monster escaped from Cryo- Prison this morning.
Wade did a little reminiscing.
I think he wants more than your cookies.
Your mother.
Jury found you guilty, not me.  I just called it as I saw it.  Fuck that.  You were brought here for a reason.  Doucet's escaped.  Re-animated for his parole hearing.  Killed a lot of people.  Most of them cops.
We have an antidote that'll retard the aging process.
Where?
That wasn't your plan, was it?
I'm thrilled beyond belief.
Well, that's good enough for me.
You have to use the steering wheel to turn.  The pedal for gas...
Lean year for role models.
Doucet killed my partner.
'Bout the same time I busted Doucet I tried to nail this big-time dealer. I didn't have an ID, but I was close. Too close.  Gained the confidence of a badass named Dubbs.  He was going to turn me onto the big man.  He made me for a cop.  Mysteriously my fellow officers discovered ten pounds of heroin in my cruiser.
Nothing makes sense when you're a cop.
Yeah.  Least I think so.  Twenty- six years this March.
I'll be okay.
Lighten up.  You're going to give yourself an ulcer.
No, sir.
Fire up that thing of yours and tell me all credit card trans- actions after eight o'clock.
Aaah... Mother of Jesus.
You startin' a fan club or some- thin'?
Says here one of our boys brought him down.  You ever heard of a badge named Wade?
But he was such a good cop.
They always are.
Well I've got news for you.  This dirty cop was the <u>only cop</u> who could bag Doucet.
This little thing says I can't.
It's stuck, but thanks for the offer.
Lying to you -- Why should I?
'N Daniel Webster will be there.
I think I'd like to begin with the fire-eater --
Well, I thought he'd come in the middle.
Yes, it's the debt and the lien and the mortgage that eats up the farmer!
We'll be mighty glad to have you with us.
-- of what happens after we die!
Yes, of course, people forgot -- or the men who knew about it died, you know how these things happen.
A pin, Neighbor Stone! I'm afraid, you'll have to prick your finger -- but what's a little pain to a lucky man?
1840. Well, that'll take us to the seventh day of April in 1847.
Yes, I did -- but you tricked me into signing it! You told me my soul was nothing ... that I could forget all about a soul, in exchange for money. That was a lie, a lie, a lie.
Not at all, lad -- not at all.  For a good game of horseshoes I would always sacrifice fame and acclaim.
What -- what's on your mind?
They'd have a good neighbor, Jabez -- and that's worth much more than anything else -- much, much more!
Oh, come, man, come. Just because you've sold your soul to the devil that needn't make you a teetotaler.
Dan'l Webster is coming to my party.
That's fine. Now you can tell people all about the house, but don't mention Webster.
Oh yes -- I am -- want to bet?
Hold the splint tighter -- it's almost done.  Go on reading, Ma. This man, Job, he had troubles, didn't he?
I will, Mary -- always thought a man could be stronger alone -- seems I've been wrong about that.
You'll never change -- will you?
Jabez --
I'll get it, Jabez.
I'm serious.
And I don't want to have a washwoman for a wife.
Isn't that your own fault?
Well -- I am worried about the way you've changed. That was one thing you said you'd never do -- remember?
Jabez! What kind of talk is that for the Sabbath? And me a-reading the holy word!
Well ... make him keep quiet.
Hush up such talk, Jabez!
Most outlandish thing I ever heard tell.  Don't seem right, somehow!
Say, Mary, how is your shoulder?
I know, Ma, but -- Suppose a man got his money in bad ways --
Wouldn't profit him none.
I say -- it don't matter.
Me? Why, look here, Mary Stone -- I'm worried about you, that's all.
You aren't angry with me?
Gee, would you, Mr. Webster? Honest?
Mary -- you've talked to me as you might have talked to your father and I believe he wants me to help you a little. You see, sometimes we think we're licked in this life -- but we weren't put here to be licked. Don't you believe it. Sometimes the shadows seem to get hold of us -- the shadows and the evil -- but it is still up to us to fight. Now I was thinking before you came, of coming over to Cross Corners end of the month, to get acquainted with my Godson -- and other things.
Mr. Webster -- you will help him?
I'll be there, too!
And who with better right? When the first wrong was done to the first Indian, I was there. When the first slaver put out for the Congo, I stood on the deck. Am I not spoken of, still, in every church in New England? 'Tis true, the North claims me for a Southerner, and the South for a Northerner, but I am neither. To tell the truth, Mr. Webster, though I don't like to boast of it, my name is older in the country than yours.
I can't be honest with them.
The past six months.
But meant her moving here.
Mind if I play some tunes?
Not any more.
I'm tired of sitting here waiting to see who gets us killed first... them...or your husband.  Hi there.
Don't you think I know that!  Put Hans on!  Hans, listen to me, that shithead doesn't know what kind of scum you are, but I do --
It's useless to you!  There's seven safeguards on our vault, and the code key is only one of them!  You'll never get it open!
Sounds better than nothing.
'Yippe-ki-yea, mother fucker'?  Now you are fucked.
I told you...
I've seen enough phoney ID's in my time to recognize that the ones they've got cost a fortune.  Add all that up and I don't know what the fuck it means, but these are bad ass preps and they're here to stay.
Then this won't matter.  LAPD's not calling the shots anymore.
Stand by, Powell.  I gotta check something out.
Dwayne Robinson.  Well, what have you learned?  What do they want?
We don't exactly know, Sir.  He won't give us him name.  He appears to be the man who called in the report...he's killed one of the terrorists for sure and claims he capped two others.
Who the hell knows?  Maybe he was a stockbroker who looked at the Dow Jones and opted for early retirement!
Listen.
Yeah.  A lot of guns.
I love you.
You know, Sonny, I used to dope a lot, and I was into dipping?  And I did a couple bank jobs, and the Lord Jesus in his everlasting mercy saved me, you know how?
Yeah, well...maybe you better talk to one of these others, okay?
Now don't give me that deep shit now.  Don't start with that shit.
Yeah... obviously you don't... when you put a gun to somebody's head... and you say go to sleep so that it won't hurt when I pull the trigger. Death?  Don't talk about death to me.  I have been living with death for the last six months.  Why do you think I'm in the hospital?  I take a handful of pills to get away from you.  And then here I am out of the hospital talking to you on the phone... again.  I have no friends left.  No job.  I can't live.  I have to live with people. This death business... I'm sorry!
God, Algeria!  Do you know there's a bunch of... they walk around there... God!  People walk around with masks and things on their heads.  They're a bunch of crazy people there.
Sal... Sal... Naturale, oh boy!
What?
That's great.  Just terrific.  You talk to me with them on the phone, right?  That is really smart.  And, you don't tell me?
No!  They're standing all around me. Seven thousand fucken cops... all around me.
They won't talk to you.
That's good then.  You've found something.
Well... I don't know if I have or not.
It made him crazy - so much demand, he'd fly into this rages.  And I got more depressed than ever; I saw I'd never get the operation.  So I tried to take my life - I swallowed about a half pound of pills ... blues, reds, yellows, downers, uppers, screamers ... you name it. But I just threw them up and wound up in the hospital.  Sonny comes there and looks at me and just says: 'Wow!'  So when I hear he's in the bank, I almost go crazy because I know he's doin' it for me.
How is he gonna hurt you on the telephone?
How many you got in there?
Call me Sonny-boy.
Call me whatever you want.
They're what's keeping me alive. You think you're dealing with an idiot?  Talk to me then.
I don't forget about Sal and the boom boom room.  I want you to see this.
It's okay, you got a lot of protection.
So, what were they doin'?  You're tellin' me you had nothin' to do with that back there?
Well, what were you doin' back there?
What else?
He's all doped up.
What makes you think you'll be able to control it?
Gimme the traveler's checks and the register.
Gimme the keys to get outta here!
Give me the keys...
Well, they go to guard school.
You know more than the Doctor? You're not okay, look at you.  Come on ...  ... let's get him out ...
I'll be God damned if you will.
Special to me, too.
Yeah.
Everything's all right?  You okay?
I used to, but I stopped.
You're really pure, you know?  You got a perfect record.  You never used that stuff to ruin your body, why start now?
Fuck him - let him out!
Let's go, Sonny.
I want him to think that.
What do you mean?  You talkin' about coppin a plea?
Wyoming ... That's not out of the country -- that's in the United States ... Look, I'll be back.
I never been up in a plane before.
I've got a jet.  I'll have airport limousine here in a half hour.  I want the hostages.
What I said.  You just sit quiet and we'll handle Sal.
What is it?  Did you just barge in here... He doesn't have plan.  It's all a whim.  'Rob a bank!  What not?'
... Just give me time to think...
Goodbye, honey.  Wish us luck!
What's wrong with that?  The FBI was very understanding when I explained it to him.  Everybody knows it isn't you ... It's the pressures from your home life.
For God's sake don't start in on Heidi again ...
I know you wouldn't need Leon if Heidi was treating you right.  The thing I don't understand is why you come out and sleep with Heidi anyway?  You got two kids on welfare now.  What're you goin' to bed with her, you don't have enough with one wife and two kids on welfare, you want a wife and three kids on welfare?

Will you speak the fucking English language? The poor girl has no clue what you're talking about.  The boy speaks English, you know. Reads, writes, I swear it. He does this when he's around girls. Thinks it's cute.
Maybe you should fuck her mom then.
Don't fuck with me, Ed. Not you, not tonight.
Yes.
I fucked up. You can't help your greedy black lying ass from trying to get everything. All you've done is put a death sentence on Meeka.

I think that you're lying. I think you know exactly where the money is.
I became a bounty hunter because of cunts like you.  I remember all the cunts in high school who were mean to me. Eventually... they all grew up to be just like you. Angry and bitter because they peaked early... and now they're stuck in some dead end marriage... or worse yet... an unfulfilling job that keeps them from meeting a man.
Be kind to your sitter.
Why must you fight... everything that is normal? You are blessed with such beauty. Life could be so easy... if only you allowed yourself to fit the mold.
I refuse to turn out like them. Twenty-one years old and they're already looking for a husband.  Stupid fucking cunts with no self- esteem. They let the boys control their lives. Not me.

No.  I'm just a struggling Black man trying to keep my dick hard in a cruel and harsh world.
OK, but listen up.  I'm gonna break it down.
Too long!  Too long.  Now for the life of me, I haven't been able to figger this out.  Either dem Koreans are geniuses or we Blacks are dumb.

HARRY, I said don't 'dress like a Queen'!
How do you know it's for us?
Wanna bet?
Sucks for you.
I think she wants me to come over to put me into the right position to check out her delicates, what ever that means.
Oh yeah, buddy, you're gonna get "some".
Okay, I saw this in a movie once. Open the dining room window and follow my lead. Say what I say.
So, have you given him "some" yet? 
HARRY!
Oh, telling inside jokes now, are we? That's it. You're out of the cool crowd. Next time Turk's passing out wedgies, you ain't gettin' one.
I know I did.
Yeah, we should never let a woman come between us again.
Right.
Well, when 200 students are hospitalized with stomach cramps I think it's newsworthy.
No.
Look Ms. Heller, there's something fishy here, and I don't think it's Friday's special.
Don't answer me. Say what I say.
Do you want me to pet your head?
Oh Harry's doing just fine, he's just about to open up.
You know, "some". The fag stuff.
So no small talk? Good, 'cause I don't know how to make that. Yep. Small talk. Not for me. Not a fan.  Got any hobbies? How 'bout this weather?
This is so embarrassing, it's never happened before. Well, maybe a couple of times, but I was alone.
Principal of jail. Wow. What a promotion.
So I'm an "arrrrrs-hole", eh Captain Rob?
Skateboard.
So miss snoopy reporter girl, it appears that you've snooped yourself into a corner and snoopcuffed yourself to a desk. Whose wearing the Coconut bra now?
Collins can be a pretty crafty guy, what do I do if he smells the trap.
Small potatoes. This one is big time. This is visionary. This idea is genius.
I think you'll make a good teacher.
And, take some more pictures.
What?
What papers?
The evidence of what?
She's been snooping around a lot, asking questions.
Why don't you see to it the kids are ready for the parade tomorrow. I have to pay somebody a little visit.
Yes. So as soon as Zimmer shows up, we'll get our check and blow this pop stand before anyone finds out anything.
He wishes to inform you that Vendetta -- as he puts it, using the ancient tongue, the art of Kanly -- is still alive. He does not wish to meet or speak with you.
This is my son, Paul.
I shall want telepathy during his visit and a report when we're finished.
I am your Truthsayer, my lord...  He is here, my lord.
Yes.
Yes. I sensed the play in you lad, but this can no longer be play. Tomorrow we leave for Arrakis! Arrakis is real. The Harkonnens are real.
Paul!!  Paul!!
Death may be the result....  Are you sure?
It could only be one thing....  It's a crysknife.
Paul... please, Paul... listen to the Reverend Mother and do what she tells you.
You carry my unborn sister in your womb!
He knows.
Yes...
Those sounds could be imitated.
Greetings.  I am Slick Slomopavitz, Seeker of Adventure.
Uh, Greetings.  I am the Count...
No.  I never drink -- wine.
Yes.  I'm embarking on another bus- andótruck tour of "Dracula." Twelve cities in ten days, if that's conceivable.
Take my word for it.  You want to "score" with a young lady, you take her to see "Dracula."
No thank you, Eddie.  I'll be alright.
Yeah, it's gonna be a great picture! You'll love your character!  Bunny, Bela's here.  Look, hit the bars, work some parties, and get me transvestites!  <u>I need transvestites</u>!
Oh, like Jekyll and Hyde!  Ah, I've always wanted to play Jekyll and Hyde!  I'm looking forward to this production.
Well... can't I play the romantic part?  I'm tired of always being the bad guy.  You know, back in Hungary, I played Romeo!  I would like to be the lover again -- me, in a boat, with the girl...
No!  <u>Doctor Acula</u>!  You can still wear the cape, have the fangs... but you're a doctor!  Not a count.
"Beg to differ.  This casket incarpratates, er, inporporates --"
Ach!  How do they expect a Hungarian to pronounce this dialogue?  This live television is madness!
We didn't make a dime.
Stop worrying.  This is going to raise your spirits.
No.  Seriously.  I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done for me.  A great man like you shouldn't have to run around in freezing water at four in the morning.
Norma.  She changed her mind.  She doesn't wanna marry me.  Can you put down the gun?
That's great.  Let's do a take.
WRONG!  I'm getting my first series of hormone shots!  And once those babies kick in, they're gonna remove my organs, and MAKE ME A WOMAN!
These shoes are itchy.
NO!  It has to be UNDERWATER!
I know... But sometimes I get scared this is as good as it's gonna get...
Huh?!  Oh, uh, no, I didn't get the job. But something <u>better</u> happened!
I thought he was dead.
Hon', nobody's bothered but you.  Look around -- they couldn't care less.
Some weirdo who likes to wear dresses.
Who do you think's been paying the rent?!  Who helped type your script, and did all your grunt work?!
Oh really?  How much money did he put up?
None.  But his dad gave me fifty grand.
Wood Productions.  The mark of quality.
I understand you just moved here?
Yes.  Hollywood is oh so exciting.
Perhaps a small amount of money.  How much do one of your motion pictures cost?
I don't know.  Hey Bill, which dress is better for you, the green or the red one?
Yeah.  Well I need the other sixty-thousand.
I just made this picture, over at Screen Classics.  It opens next week.
Nobody in town has seen it, so I'm givin' you first crack at my talents.
<u>I'm</u> interested in the picture business.  My associates and I wish to produce a series of uplifting religious films, on the Apostles. But unfortunately, we don't have enough money.
From outer space!  It's science- fiction.  <u>Very</u> big with the kids! If you make this picture, you'll have enough money to finance a HUNDRED religious films!  <u>And</u> pay my back rent from the profits.
"Perfect"?  Mr. Wood, do you know <u>anything</u> about the art of film production?!
Mm, not good-lookink enough.
Tell me about it.  I'm supposed to do a thriller at Universal, and they want Charlton Heston to play a <u>Mexican</u>!
Don't worry.  We're not gonna film any of it.
They'll notice.  Look, why don't you let me take over from here?  I can do a few tricks: Pad it out with more stock footage, add establishing shots...
Yeah??  Well Orson Welles didn't wear angora sweaters, did he??!
The marriage already ended.
Sounds like you lived in Grovers Corners.
Thanks.  It's actually the only thing I know how to make.  Hey, can you grab that strainer?
I was a fuckin' HACK!  I let people recut the movies, cast their relatives...  I let Bela down...
Do you want your buttons on the left or the right?
The poor girl's out of a job.
But it's pouring.  And the car top is stuck!
Yes?
No.  I think my film is perfect for you.
Look buddy, I'm a big star.  I've got real offers from real studios.  I don't need to blow some dentist for a part.  So forget it!
It's terrible.  People won't even return my calls.  It's like I don't exist.
The <u>Ghoul's Wife</u>?!  God, I can't believe I'm doing this...
You don't wanna be noticed?
It's made from specially-bred rabbits that live in the Himalayas.
No, I work in pictures.  I'm a director-actor-writer-producer.
No you're not!  This marriage was never consummated.  I'm getting an annulment!
I guess -- I don't -- it's all in the contract. There's this million-page contract --
At the point -- I don't -- Look you'd be on TV maybe one or two times each. I'11 try to avoid I'11 go out of my way to avoid, getting together with you. Believe me.
Yeah. Ma...
What?
Ooh, the sister! She is hot.
Okay, so you understand? We're installing a permanent camera in your bedroom, one in the kitchen, one in the living room, plus, of course, there'll always be a couple of steady-cams following you.
Sure.
Just wait here. She's coming right back out.
I was at this comedy club last week and this comedian says "If you're over thirty and your job requires you to wear a name tag, you screwed up your life." And I'm laughing and then I realize I wear a nametag.
So do I. So what? I'm doing all right.
No! Like, ten years ago. In Texas. Baby...  Jessica!
And then, uh... you know it blew over and he went back to being a fireman again.
Oh.
No. Maybe he's watching.  Tell him you're sorry. Tell him you'11 stay away from that girl.
Holy sh--
He says --
One thing led to another. He was my husband once.
Do you think it's been easy for me? It's been years. Al can't have sex.
She left.
Well, no. You agreed to stay on the air as long as we asked you to. The station entered into this on that understanding. If you had refused we'd have begun this with somebody else. You can't just change the rules in the middle of the game, son. It's not fair to us. More importantly, it's not fair to the viewers. They're interested in you. They've devoted hours and days and weeks of their lives to you.
Not too good. That's why it states in your contract that if you do not continue to live a normal life, you're in violation and are liable for the station's financial losses. Ed, I urge you to reconsider. I urge you on behalf of all those people out there whose lives have become so entwined with yours. Play fair with them, Ed.
They're gonna mock our foibles.
I saw this show once. It was about logging. I was home sick, there was nothing else on. Do you know how they break up really bad log jams? You know, when they're really tangled... ?
Cream rinse?
I kissed my boyfriend's brother on television!
Sunday night at the Devils game, I'm driving the Zamboni.
Twenty-nine.
So my little brother's staying here. I'm sleeping with Rita.
I'm sorry.
Come on, let's go.
Where?
No... Could you?
What?
Come on.
What?
Marcia's living with a singer?
She didn't know he was a criminal. They had a relationship. They --
Oh. All right. I'11 watch at home, then.
Oh, man, I've been trying to call you.
I know.
I love you! 1 want to marry you!
Do you still have it?
Ed?
Oh, an TV a minute and already an attitude.
El/ella -
Don't tell me that.  I don't want to know that.
I know.  I know its not by choice.  I just mean, well, being the kind of person you are, it must be really difficult to find someone you can talk to.
Yeah, just --
I thought those were the rules, Mr. McAllister. If they've changed in any way --
But, they were there I counted 803 votes.
NO, that's fine
You bet.
Good luck, Tracy.
If it's about the posters, I think it's so awful. It's a travesty.
Were you or were you not working in the Watchdog office over the weekend?
6:30.  How do you know what time the posters were torn down?
well, I don't know.  It could have been anybody.  There are a lot of, you know, subversive elements around Millard.  You know, like Rick Thieson and Kevin Speck and those burn-outs.  Or Doug Schenken - what about him?  Or what about Tammy Metzier?  Her whole thing is being anti- this and anti-that.
Uh-huh.
Hmm?
Okay.  Because I know who did it.  So.. I'll just be outside.
Well, this is hard for me, but I think it's important to be honest. Don't you?
Okay.  Give me the drill.
You sure?
We'll let it run awhile
Easy, tiger.  Come by after school. I'll leave Darryl with the sitter.
I was lonely.  You took advantage
Me?  I took advantage of you?  You hugged me!  You kissed me!  You're the one who --
What do you mean?
Huh?  Oh.  Uh... pears
Oh, okay.  Yeah, sorry.
Sorry. My figures work out exactly the same as Jim's. 256 for Paul, 255 for Tracy.
But other people can see them too.
For what?
I mean at you.
I don't know.  You're her brother you should know.
It was Tammy I  That's who it was.
What do you mean?
Well, I mean, you know, I talked to him and everything, but he just said he thought it was a good idea... and how there's all different kinds of fruit and...  It's nothing against you, Tracy. You're the best.  I just thought --
Yeah.
Sure, Paul.  No hard feelings.
Okay.  Great.  I feel good.
You wanna buy your brother ten years...?  You don't have to say anything.  Just look at this list and point.  Here.
He's waiting for you to mention mention.
He takes a cut of our earnings and invests it for us.  He makes us quit the life at thirty.  He doesn't let us use narcotics and he doesn't abuse us.  Can your policeman's mentality grasp those contradictions?
Sure, boss.  Sure you can.
Yeah, sure... I got a couple of hours before I have to be at the Victory.  Want to grab a beer?
It's confidential, Bud.  Like that magazines Vincennes scams for. <u>Hush-Hush</u>.  I'll see you tomorrow.  And hey, if it works out, you'll get a piece of it.
It's a surprise.  You like surprises, don't you, White?
Someone held up a coffee shop, panicked and killed six people.
Johnny Stompanato told me when Meeks disappeared, he was trying to move the 18 pounds of heroin that went missing when Deuce Perkins was shot.
If I let you go, there'll be ten more lawyers to take your place tomorrow.  They just won't come on the bus, that's all.
Then listen closely, because I'll only say this once and if it gets repeated, I'll deny it.  I run call girls.  Lynn Bracken is one of them and so was Susan Lefferts. I treat my girls very well.  I have grown daughters, myself, and I don't like the thought of women being hurt.  I sense you share this feeling.
I think she'd been hit in the face with a tennis racket.  She is -- was -- a big doubles fan.
Susan Lefferts.
It looks like she was flailing, trying to get away.
But she's moving away from the door.  Who was sitting at this table?
<u>Ear plugs</u>.
It's like they knew they were going to kill everyone before they went in...
Clean?
Say what and so what.
Believed what?
You ain't woofin' I did.  Stupid down home niggers got no more sense than a fuckin' dog.
Say what?
What does that have to do --
The youngest applicant by eight years.
Am I...?  Would you be willing to plant corroborative evidence on a suspect you knew was guilty in order to ensure an indictment?
Dudley, we've been over this.
I... No.
No.
Would you be willing to shoot hardened criminals in the back to offset the chance --
Then for God's sake, don't be a detective.  Stick to assignments where you won't have to make those choices.  Patrol, Internal Affairs, but not the Bureau.
At least get rid of the glasses. I can't think of one Bureau man who wears them.
No, Edmund.  He's a man who can answer yes to those questions I ask you from time to time.
So be it.
Lucky for you that my wife and four fair daughters are at the beach in Santa Barbara.
What's this all about, lad?
No.
Yeah, Exley.  What's the payoff?
You should be the last person who wants to dig any deeper into the Nite Owl, <u>Lieutenant</u>.
Movie star hookers.  Whatever you desire... It's Fleur-fr-Lis again.
Yeah.  But first I want to brace Stompanato.
What?
I'm going to Lynn Bracken's.  I'll meet you at the Dining Car.
A vulgar term, but yes.
Okay.  Look, if it helps, Bud hates himself for what he did.
Where is he?
Some men get the world.  Others get ex-hookers and a trip to Arizona.
I'm not going to dignify youwith answers.  If you'll excuse me, I've got a Jack Vincennes press conference to prepare for.
What's Dudley's scheme?
Mrs. Lefferts, I just want to ask a few questions.
A sweet man.
Yeah, it's subtle.
Something good?
Don't know.  I'm chasing picture books.  Fuck shots, but the posers don't look like junkies.  It's well done stuff.  I thought you might have heard something.
Sure, he just tried to throw me off the force last Christmas as a little joke.
Jackie, all I know is what you know.  The man is very rich.  And he's invested in freeway construction so he's gonna get a lot richer.  But that's it. Patchett's what I like to call 'Twilight.'  He ain't queer, he ain't Red, he can't help me in my quest for prime sinuendo.
Something like that.
Showbiz.
Vincennes, is there someplace you'd rather be?
Brill's dead. He died of small pox when he was two and he was buried in a Kansas field.  My name doesn't matter.
He didn't give you an address? He didn't give you a phone number?
Me neither, but the upshot is I've got color live-action footage of you and Ms Hawkins and it doesn't look good.
They keep taking the bird seed. I thought since you're the expert on--
Clear as day.
Who else have you told?
When can you get it here?
I'll come straight there.
Be careful, Danny.
Except for the part about my setting up a company in Zurich and knowing anyone named Sam Vollotti and having any relationship whatsoever with the Gambino family.
That's who they are.
They're spooks.
I don't know what that--
What if--
Look, you gave me some work over the last year. We'll call it even.
And you were worried about me. That's nice, I appreciate--
Look, my wife is understandably--
What'd I tell you?
It was '72. I figured we had enough problems without monitoring a Berkeley kid's class schedule. So I sold my story to <u>Ramparts</u> and split.
They come after you?
I didn't see a warrant. Did you see a warrant?
Fuckin-A.
Tell him we're not gonna hurt him.
They've done it before. Takes maybe two minutes.
How?
I know my phone number and I know the number for SportsPhone. Beyond that--
Not particularly, no.
Who's calling?
Well then who can?
You'd like to buy your wife some lingerie as a Christmas gift.
Can you help me?
Thanks.
Because my life is being ruined.
Daniel's life is already ruined. Maybe if you guys stopped thinking about yourselves for a change and--
Thanks.  Who are you?
Because I don't know.
I'm just trying to determine if Mr. Zavitz was involved in something more than a simple bus accident.
Somebody took my blender.
Not that I could see.
Yes sir.
I think you're taking it seriously enough for both of us.
How could you let me find out like this?
I see her for business.
Do you know what I'm looking at Robert?
Stacy--
I know, but listen--
Yes.
I don't think anybody wants the drapes, Stacy, I think the drapes are okay.
Well...yeah.
That's okay.
Why the hell would I--
I want to talk to a goddam lawyer.
Never.
Yes.
I just want to make sure I'm not breaking the law.
You got a minute?
It's really not a good idea for me to be seen with you.
How?
I <u>did</u> care how.
Forget me, forget what I did for you. Don't <u>ever</u> mention my name or try to contact me again. Get it?
I got a call this morning from a source I trust. The Post is running a lead this afternoon about your involvement in the Bellmoth investigation.
I don't under--
Put David on it. He seems anxious to clear my name.
That's because your Union bosses <u>are</u> those Guido mother-fuckers.
I don't under--
Why would the Union--
Who won the fight?
I'm not goin' anywhere, Eric. I live here.
They didn't take the silverware?
I have a family.
Yeah?
It's been a few years.
Yes sir.
Who?
Help from whom?  Christ.
Yes sir.
What's your ETA?
He's carrying the damn <u>flag</u>.
I don't know what's going on, but if you people have tripped over your own asshole again, you're not gonna get any help from us. It's ending at your doorstep.
Then let's assume I don't.
Excuse me?
You've been cheated, don't worry, we'll take it back.
This is not worth eight pounds, Mrs. Clifton.
What do you mean, poetry?
Ask Al Auf. Almásy asks Al Auf in Arabic.
They're so untidy.  I'm just trying to rearrange them.
Fiction.  We had a house on that coast and it never rained blood. Go on.  More.
Oh my God, the others!
Of course.  Is it, am I a terrible coward to ask how much water we have?
Don't.
That makes it harder still.
Okay.  And what do you love? Say everything.
Yes.  A different wife.
You will.  You will.
What?
Would you let me pass?
I've watched you - on verandahs, at Garden Parties, at the Races - how can you stand there?  How can you ever smile?  As if your life hadn't capsized?
I know, darling, I'm sorry.
Don't talk.
You speak so many bloody languages and you never want to talk.
Don't leave me!
Yes.  Absolutely.
I know.
Still a car.
What did you do?
Absolutely right, shut up. Lashings of apologies all round.
Okay.
It's impossible.  I was buying or selling something.  I've been to Cairo many times.
Oh, all over.
I told her you would never invent such a preposterous name.
I've had a drink.  Fatal.
What?
There are going to be trials, they want me to interpret, don't they know I'm allergic to courtrooms?
You were the only man who knew the desert well enough, the only man who would cross seventeen hundred miles of nothing.
But finally able to explore the Cairo night-life. I shall produce an authoritative guide to the Zinc Bars and - I want to say Harems - am I in the right country for Harems?
I do so love you.  What do you smell of?
I was repairing the stairs.  I found a library and the books were very useful.
Could I have a cigarette?
Why are you so determined to keep me alive?
He's going back to the front this evening.  I can't see him otherwise.
Just go off.  I'll be quite all right.
He keeps asking me questions about you. Do you know him?  Do you recognize him?
Yes, of course, I'm so sorry. Stupid of me. Hana gets up, upset to have hurt him.
They have to clear all the local roads of mines.  That's a big job. They won't stay in the house. They're putting up their tent in the garden.
I don't think it does.  Anyway, he's indifferent to me.
Don't depend on it.  Will you? That little bit of air, each day there's less of it, which is al right, which is quite all right.
That was a dance we invented at the International Sand Club.
The mines, the wires, there's a trick. Some explode if you stretch the wires, some if you cut them.
I've done this.  I've had to do this.
No. But he hands them over.
Nya-nya-nya!
It's what I've learned.
Then come with me.
If anything happened to you I'd never forgive myself.
No.  He's - no.
Very kind of you, we can always eat in the town with the others -
A toddler
He's sleeping.
What if you couldn't find him…?  Sergeant, not today, please. Not this morning.
I'd like to spend a night with you in a bed.
We can do that when we're very, very old.
No.
Yeah. Me.
Where are you at least?
That's good. Terrific.
Excuse me?
Because you young Americans think the world began when you were born. You fall apart when you don't get your own way.
I'm sorry. This just means so much to me.
That old pirate Chiang Kai Shek personally took this to Taiwan when he was run out of China in 1949. Peking would dearly love to have this back...
Roki has a vivid imagination.
Quite a good one. A Monet. Not major, but it is Giverney.
Damn, I knew I forgot something.
What's your problem? I'm doing the job.
They're having a farewell party the last night. Before the Mask goes back to Taiwan.
Oh, I think you can do it. Probably.
Aren't we all.
Bookshelf. Sensors--
In eye of that painting.
These rooms are solid stone. They haven't changed.
The Mask.
No, no, please God, you're wrong. I'm a thief. Just like you.
What do I need a thief for? I've got the Mask.
The big job.
A billion dollars.
You don't know the half of it.
Sure, it's only worth 25 million or so, don't bother telling me what you're going to do with it.
Everyone has secrets, it's what makes us human.
Sit down, I'll show you how we're going to do it.
What? Another job? Stealing the Eiffel Tower?
They'll each be positive the other guy did it.  I fear an ugly international incident.
The disc is still in there.
No way.
Go!
But--
What about you?
Next time I'll use valet parking.
It's never big enough.
It's a death mask. Death mask means dead.
I cannot tell you a goddamned lie. She's selling you a pig in a poke. We better do this tonight.
She reminds you of yourself. There's nobody you admire more.
Faith is angels dancing on the head of a pin. I got to have trust.
You don't really think I'd leave ten million dollars worth of our chips in her bag?  What matters isn't what's real. It's what we <u>think</u> is real--what matters is the art.
Oh, hell.  I'm dyslexic.
What about in terms of medical expenses? 250,000 doesn't come close to what this family's gonna have to spend on doctors.
Oh, Jesus.  Who's responsible for his pain and suffering this time?
There's more than one?
Yeah.  There's two.  Why?
He came tearing around the corner, out of control --
Yeah?  I should learn to do stuff like that. They make the place feel real homey.
For what?
Any school you want.
Yeah.  I know.
You did?  Wow, sorry about that.  Listen, Mario's a little not so bright.  He seems to think that you said --
I'm sorry about that.  Really.  But --
I don't wanna take your money, Mr. Masry.
Good.
That's not how we work here.  You don't just leave a message and take off.
It doesn't take a genius to look at those medical records and think something's wrong.
Ten.  There's a lot of other places I could work.
It's not about working hard --
Kinda like David and what's-his-name's whole fucking family.  Okay, here's the deal -- if, and only if, you find me the evidence to back all this up -- I'll do it.  I'll take it on.
Another raise wouldn't hurt.  And with all the time I'm gonna be spending on the road, I'll probably be needing my own cel phone, won't I?
It didn't help, but no.  The real problem's on the bottom.
I would now.
Boy, this job takes me to some of the best damn places, huh?
Things like the head counsel for PG&E calling me with an offer.  20 million, plus attorney's fees.  Take it or leave it.
Bullshit.  You stuck me in Siberia dictating to some God damn steno clerk so you could finish this thing without me.  After all I've done for you, that's the thanks I get.
Perks?  Jesus -- <u>perks</u>?
With nothing linking it to the corporate offices yet, I'd say we'll end up on the lower end of that.  Still a lot of money.
Tuesday at seven, at the Hinkley firehouse.
The luckiest son of a bitch in the universe, Erin.  The luckiest son of a bitch in history.
Sixty-nine.  We've got good answers to all of 'em.
Right.
At the time, I thought, I got six kids, some of 'em want to go to college.  I can't afford to lose my job.  I told myself I was being honorable.  But there's nothing honorable in what I did.  Maybe that's why they picked me for the job. Maybe they knew what kind of man I was.
You just tell me what you want to look at and I'll be glad to dig 'em out for you.
You're married.
Ross -- you are an absolute angel.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Every county has one.  They keep records of anything water-related within their jurisdiction.  You should be able to find something there.
It happens all the time.
When?
I never forget, honey.  I try, real hard. It's just, for some reason, I don't seem to be able to organize things right and -- when it comes to you guys, I end up falling short.
You don't know six hundreds plaintiffs' numbers by heart.
I do.
You got more than one?
Cause I don't even know you.
I'm not a deadbeat.  I work when I need to.
Why in the hell would you want to watch my kids?
I guess we get what we pay for, huh?
What?  But you been working so hard --
Well, I'm sure as hell not what I thought I was gonna be.  I was supposed to have one of those great lives, with everything all laid- out and perfect.  I mean, hell -- I was Miss Wichita, for God's sakes.  Did I tell you that?  You live next door to a real live beauty queen.  I still got the tiara.  I kept it cause I thought it meant something.  I thought it meant I was gonna do something great with my life.  I thought it proved I was gonna grow up to be someone.
Well, hell, I guess that's it, then, huh? They're scarred for life.  They're gonna start holding up 7-11's any day now.
I know what you're saying, and I don't wanna hear it.  I am doing the best I can.
I'm not in danger.  I have a dead bolt. Remember?
Keep your voice down.
No, no jokes, I gotta pee.  Just tell me about your day.  What went on back there?
It's a pair of earrings.  I saw 'em in the mall one day, and I thought, damn, those would look good on those beautiful earlobes. So I bought 'em.  And I said to myself, next time Erin says something nice, does something nice, I'll surprise her with 'em.  Know how long ago that was?  Six months.  In six months, you haven't said one nice thing to me.  That's a long time.
Yeah, you can.  You could just quit.  People do it all the time.
It's not for me; it's for my kids.  You're the only one I trust them with.
Hunh-uh.  Not yet.  Look, don't take any of 'em on your bike, okay?  Call a cab if you wanna go somewhere.
I'm real sorry, Laura.
What's going on?
There may be jobs where you can disappear for days at a time, but this isn't one of them.  Here, if you don't do the work, you don't get to stay.
Hi, I'm Erin Brockovich.  I was just over in the library there, asking a mess of questions about -- I guess they call it epidemiology? -- and the fella there told me to find you, cause you know all about it.
No one put me up to anything.  I was just hoping I could ask you a couple questions.
They've both got some immune system problem. Can't say what from, whether it's viral or genetic or what, but something's wrong.  And these guys -- Donna and Peter --
You don't know that.  Even I cannot see their fate.
No, I'm alright.  I'm alright.
Barks his agreement.
Howls.
Barks his agreement.
I'm not looking for a friend. I'm looking for a Jedi Master.
It's the Jedi's time to eat, too.
Our destruction?  Who?
I understand.  A death mark is not an easy thing to live with ... Until our paths cross again, may the force be with you.
Fine.  But they'll have to take care of themselves.
I do hope he's all there ... if you take my meaning.  I would hate to see Master Luke develop a short circuit ...
The energy shield is down.  We'll be stuck here forever.
You said you were going to stay. What happened?
Me?  I don't know what you mean.
Come on, your highness, are you telling me you haven't been thinking about that kiss?
To get killed ... you're not seriously going into an asteroid field?
Aren't I?  Hang on, sweetheart. We're gonna do some flyin'.
Would you please stop calling me that?
There will be more of them.  They always travel in groups.  And there's nothing they like better than to attach themselves to ships. Just what we need right now.
It's not my fault.  I can't under- stand it!
Oh, so sorry!  Didn't mean to offend your droid.  You think braking and shutting down in that amount of time is easy?
I'm still not sure what you've accomplished.
Let Ôer go, Chewie.
That's two you owe me, junior.
What have you done to my ship?
Shut up a minute and listen.  I'm doing what I can to make this easier for you.
Yeah, you're a real hero.
I think not.  But I don't wish my prize to be damaged.  We'll test it first.  Bring in Captain Solo.
Would you care to join me for a little refreshment?
And when do you betray us again?
This is no time to be choosy, honey.  What do you say we debate this later?  There's still a chance I can get you out of here.
Luke needs help.  We must go back.
Wait a minute.  We're not going back there.
Slim, but yes, there's a chance. They have a shelter.  It's not much, but ...
Oh my, no!
Snow creatures ... they're here?!
Size has no meaning.  It matters not.  Look at me.  Judge me by my size do you?
They're a lot stronger than I'm used to.
Free your mind and return he will.
I've learned so much since then.  And I'll return to finish ... I promise that, master.
Good God.
A display of primitive apparatus --
Zero emotional developments. Total lack of compassion. A highly developed psychopathic instinct to survive.
Sure, Cuervo, but look here. I've done it all, man. I killed Plissken, I got your girl back, I got it all. Just for you, Cuervo. Just for you.
Where's Plissken?
Cuervo Jones has more firepower than two armies. No one gets near him.
What's in it for me?
I got a new deal for you.
I don't know yet.
So what's the deal, huh? Go into L.A., find the President's daughter, secure the box, and bring 'em both out - and I'm free?
That's the deal.
Having second thoughts?
Let's just say it's what's best for the country.
Lock fuel rods.
Yeah, kinda.
So maybe we can pull off a Texas switch on Cuervo.
They live here, used to be like us. But after too many silicon implants, their muscles turned to jelly. The only way they survive is to have body parts transplanted over and over again.  Snake, nobody who comes into Beverly Hills gets out alive.
The freeway.
Utopia is lost to me. My daughter is gone.
You're running out of time.
I will not.
...Gawain and Perceval, Bors and Bohort, Caradoc and Ector, and all the others--lost to me. Only the echo of their voices remains in this empty hall. All I have left is the memory of their fellowship. Echoes and memories. I am a ghost of the King that once was...  ...Mordred is real, alive, my own flesh and blood. I will see him, I must.
I dreamed of him too... Merlin lives! He lives in our dreams now, in that dark and shadowy place that is as strong and real as this more solid one. He speaks to us from there.
That's not why you came.
Because you must! You and only you. Have you forgotten that it was you who freed Excalibur?
What book is that?
The dragon! There...
The Lady of the Lake. Take it. Take it, quickly!
Never where you expect it, that's all I know.
What is it my child?
And I offer only this, Father. To commit with passion and pleasure all the evils that you failed to commit, as man and king.
I don't know. Merlin brought you to me when you were newly born and charged me to raise you as my own. At first, I did so because I feared Merlin, later because I loved you.
I am wasting away and I cannot die. And I cannot live.
Yes. I would swear my love to you.
Love demands it.
--It must wait, child. These good ladies, for whom I intervened once, will honor me with a meal. I am beholden to them now as I was when they begged my protection.
It is.
I'm not jealous!
Shh... yes, yes. Sit with me, please... Morgana.
What's behind that beauty? A wizened, cold-hearted snake.
That's right Mike. But he's finished and came back around three ot four months ago, He's in Woodstock now.
In here!
Oh great, anything else?
Dinner at the White House.
Of course. Have you got a pen?
I just heard them Karl.
Fine thank you.
Do you think I should take her to see a psychiatrist?
And those lies she's been telling?
Never.
Well, she let loose quite a string while I was examining her, Mrs. MacNeil.
Well, I'd say her vocabulary's rather extensive.
Well, what, for example? I mean, give me a for instance!
The shaking of the bed, that's doubtless due to musuclar spasms.
Sure did.
If he came to me for spritual help, I'd say no.
To begin with it could make things worse.
Not at all. Why d'you ask?
No
What's the difference?
It's not even a good picture. Looks to mature.
Your not gonna marry him are you?
But you like him.
Okay.
You might loosen the straps then.
It would bring us together.
Tseirp a si eh! Eno on ma I! Eno on ma I! Ahhhhhhhhhhh!
Last month.
I would like you to go quickly over to the resdence Damien, and gather up a cassock for myself, two surplices, a purple stole, and some holy water, and your copy of The Roman Ritual. The Large one. I believe we should begin.
Be unto her o' Lord a fortified tower.
O'Lord hear my preyer.
Defender of the human race...
You've seen him. You're also familiar with how last week he died?
Really?
Yeah, a fall.
I get passes to the best shows in town. Mrs. K though, she gets tired and never likes to go.
That's to bad.
I've seen it.
Answer the question, Father Paranoia.
I could have you deported, you know that?
Bastards! Stop!
Shove it up your ass you faggot!
We want to see Mrs. Karras.
Is it Captain Howdy?
I'll take her inside.  You too, little Frank.  Out of the pool.
Baker.
Teeth.
Yes, yes.  It's just that John is so much nicer. Jack sounds so ... crude. When I was a little girl, we had a pig on the farm named Jack. I guess I just can't help making the association.
In the attic.  Behind some of Dad's stuff.  Look, Jack can hardly reach the pedals.
Wait.  Watch.  Here comes Dad.
Jack.
Frank.  I'm here.  I always get here.  Don't sweat it.
You look like you just crawled out of bed.
This isn't the Pine Tree Inn on Route 81, Jack.
They don't.  They're always asking about you.
It was an accident.
She threw a goddamn radio into the bathtub. How do you explain that?
No thanks.
Nothing.  Everything's great. Terrific.
Yeah, okay.
Your doorbell doesn't work.
The trees.  The flowers.  Nice.
Hey, you weren't there.  Right?
If you're unhappy with the arrangement --
I'm grateful, Frank.  How much? For the singer.
I just don't understand.  You would think someone ... anyone ...
Pearls.  White gown.  Beautiful.
I don't know.  I mean, I always did it as a kid. I figured it was no big deal.  Is it?  A big deal?
I love you.  I just wanted to say it.
It won't happen again.  Scout's honor.
How come I didn't hear anything?
A gift.  Courtesy of our courteous hotel manager, Mr. Daniels.  We, dear brother, are a fucking smash.  Yup.  They want us back.  Easter.  It seems they have this egg hunt every year.  Only not for kids. Adults.  They stuff these plastic eggs with Timexes and little certificates for free Mai Tais and everyone has a grand time crawling around on the front lawn.  Then afterwards, they have a dance.  An egg dance.  Everyone comes dressed in a different colored shell and at the end of the evening they crack themselves open.  It's our job to separate the yolks from the whites. Slippery business.
April.
A useless talent.
You could've come.
You're making things up, Frank.
Better give her pneumonia.
Are you kidding me?  Are you fucking kidding me?
What?
Sure.
I told Halloran we didn't do vocals, but he said:
Spur of the moment.
Just call me a cab.
Look, Nick.  You want us to pack up, we'll pack up.
What am I gonna do?  Put a record player out there?  Bad, Frankie.  Bad.
What do you mean?
Look, miss.  We're tired, you have gum on your lip, and we're going home.
Just like that, huh?  You're not even gonna give me a chance?
Impersonally.
You're an hour and a half late.
Uh ... Frank Baker.  This is my brother.
What I mean is --
What's wrong with it?
Just look.  What do you wear? A nine?
I wear a seven.
Okay, okay.  Here, how about this?
Switch?  What fucking switch?
Virgins.
Smells like tuna number two to me.
Yeah.
I just saw a man walk out of your room!
Susie.  It's one more show.  One more time.  That's all.
Uh ... thanks.
We trust you, Lloyd.  You know that.
Job.
Downstairs.
It's been a long time, Ma.
Yes.  I supposed you still have that old phone booth.
In and out.
Like a baby. You?
It's a shitty  song.
You're upset.
No kidding?
You sending me home?
Yeah, maybe ... No. God, I hate these cigarettes!
So ... ?
So how's the cat food business?
Oh. Carrots.  And peas.  None of the important ones.
Funny how life repeats itself, huh?  Over and over. Like a song.
What happened to the donut king?
Why not?
Merry Christmas.
Sorry, Admiral.  It wasn't mentioned in the job description.
Drive.
A few blanks?  Like what?
"Thanks?"  I guess they really did fuck you up.
Everything I say is wrong. I can't talk to her anymore.
How come?
And you wouldn't be.
Okay, you're having an emotional crisis.  You need to seek the help of a trained --
Jon, what is it?
Eve ...
Castor's still alive --  Technically.  He's a turnip, on total life-support ...
You haven't got a chance in hell of fooling Pollux. Castor drinks, smokes and walks around with a 24-hour hard-on.  He's nothing like you.
I just asked you about making love to your wife, and you started talking about your job.
Not anymore.
Too late, your kid worships me.  And your wife -- she's an animal.  Even I can't keep up with her.
Not if I kill you first ...
So's a noose.  Now keep your mouth SHUT.
Pollux is -- what?
That's your name, isn't it?
Castor's escaped!
Business first.  I went into the "Warrants" system and erased your records.  You're clean.  In fact, you're now on the informant payroll.
No -- the best part is, since it's a government job -- they can't fire you!  But how can you be sure you'll get the appointment?
All of them do.  We'll kill twelve birds with one bomb.  And we'll be rich.
A lot of people think you're a snitch.  It's dangerous ...
Done.  In fact, I was already plotting about the best way to meet the foreign bureau chiefs.
Have fun at work.
Okay, I have a confession to make.  But you aren't going to like it.
That's what I'd like to know.  She stole fifty dollars from my purse and took off.
Uh huh. The retail end, I understand.
Really. So you’re projecting what, a tad over two million?
But I think I like you better this way...
Is this another one of those Sun Tzu “Art of War” tricks?
You know how to make chocolate milk?
That’s where you work.
Ringing my bell...
It’s just two kids, right?
She is relentless.
All I’m saying it there isn’t a guy in Union County who wouldn’t give his left nut to be married to Kate...
It’s me, Jack...
Yes, that’s it...yes, we went to high school together.
Damn, you are the real thing...
You want to talk about regrets, you're talking to the wrong person.
Look Jack I’m late.  I’d love to help you out some more but I gotta go handle my business...  Happy trails.
You know what the word glimpse means, J? It’s by nature an impermanent thing.
You draw lines with pencil!  I know about this!
It’s lovely...
Very funny.  I saw you out there on lane five. What do you have the flu or something?
Believe me I know what an incredible opportunity this is for you...
I thought we had a deal about you watching CNBC in bed.
Whatever you say...honey.
Do you have any idea what my life is like?
I wake up in the morning covered in dog saliva...I drop the kids off, spend eight hours selling tires retail...retail, Kate.
I can’t believe it’s not a disappointment to you!  Jesus, Kate, I could’ve been a thousand times the man I became.  How could you do this to me?  How could you let me give up on my dreams like this?!
I think it worked out okay, don’t you?
It’s good, right?
And now...?
But you always seem so certain.
God, sometimes I think it would be so nice not to have to stretch ground beef or maybe drive a car with a CD player...
It’s like a museum.
Think bigger.
Look, you’re making this into something it’s not. This isn’t a referendum on our lives, Kate. It’s a step forward...  Don’t you see?  I’m talking about us finally having a life other people envy.
It’s good to see you...
Jack.
Hello Jack.  You don’t have to stop singing on my account...
A shelter?!  I’m the richest guy in the building...I’ve got twice the square footage you have!
That'll happen when you're about to spend thirty billion dollars on some aspirin...
Maybe it’s by the wardrobe boxes...
Congratulations. The La Guardia flight’s canceled but I got you out of Kennedy on United at nine. Am I good or what?
I wouldn't know anything about that.
My step-dad's.  I'm strictly into stone.  I was wondering when you'd walk by.
Ben.  This is business.  Just work.
No.  I cannot take orders from that underwear model.  That wingnut washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret wannabes into a flight simulator.
Actually, the engines are SMEs. Hydrogenbase, carbon propellant. Couple generations past your last ride.  I'm not as dumb as you look.
I swear to you they've done everything humanly possible.  The best plastic surgeons in the world, Ben.  You had the best --
Is it safe?
Ben, are you there?
What he's trying to say is: every team needs a mascot...
Act.  Here we go again.  Reed, what if we got these gifts for a <u>reason</u>?  What if we have some, you know...like, calling?
My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
Meet me at 4:01, top of the run. That'll give you a minute to freshen up.
Not this again --
Grow up, Johnny.  You want to run around <u>on fire</u> for the rest of your life?
Blockhead started it!
Is that what you call it?  "<i>Real</i>"?
Look around, sis!  <u>She's not here</u>.  So you can stop talking to me like I'm your little boy --
History, Leonard.  <u>History</u>. Everything else is conversation...  How's the other matter?
You remember in school we talked about working together.  That's what I was about to explain...
Ben's still out there --
Right.  That's exactly what I meant.
What?  What do you mean you --
Let's not jump to conclusions, we need a <i>massive amount of evidence</i> before making that leap.
Anger.  Rage.  Frustration.
Better than your <u>life</u>.  Victor's not the one who has to get into that thing.  <u>We</u> are.
<u>I'm</u> not the only one in there.  I got you, Vic, Ben, Johnny, all rattling around in there.
Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
I'm sure I can come up with something.
Right, of course, the company... But you see, I've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with --
Skeptical...?
We understand your concern, but we've made our decision, Doctor. Any questions? Anybody?
That would give us only three seconds to revive him...
Message to Proteus.
<Me>?
Here's the Surgeon.
Sorry, but I'm rusty on surgeons. Who's the girl?
What can I do? Except maybe pass out?
I -- I want to say...
Thank you for volunteering.
But I did. I'm positive!
Not now. We need air, not greetings!
No, it requires such absolute precision --
Depends on which end of the telescope you look through.
Not in a sealed vessel like an Artery.  Captain -- something must be wrong with your controls!
Better Judgment?! To wait until the actual operation -- when it may be too late?
You left something out.
Don't tell me they're refueling...
If I can relieve the pressure on a few key vessels...
That line was tampered with...
I can't believe it. Whatever happened was an accident.
It's possible --
I always had an idea there was only one System. The Circulatory.
Positions, please. And strap yourselves in.
Enough to breathe, but that's all.
We're entering a Capillary. Remain in the middle.
Yeah, I just came in. I decided not to park here.
I'm sorry, sir, we do have to charge you the four dollars.
No Jean, no money!
Unghh... oh, geez...
Yeah, yeah, Jesus - I'm sayin', we'll stop for pancakes, then we'll get laid. Wuddya think?
Huh?  Grimsurd looks at his thumb.
The new vehicle, plus forty thousand dollars.
I'm not gonna sit here and debate. I will say this though: what Shep told us didn't make a whole lot of sense.
What the heck're you talkin' about? Let's just finish up this deal here -
Blood has been shed, Jerry.
DON'T EVER INTERRUPT ME, JERRY! JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP!
Well, I'm sorry, but I just - I -
IS IT, JERRY?  You ask those three pour souls up in Brainerd if a deal's a deal! Go ahead, ask 'em!
...Yah, well, you stay away from Scotty now -
Oh, now he's adorable.
Oh, no, I can't let you do that.
Officer Olson.
Uh-huh.
Just a general way.
Oh sure. They say she's gonna turn cold tomorrow.
Chaska.
Uh-huh.
And yet you're gettin' C grades. It's this disparity there that concerns your dad and me.
What's the next step here, Jerry?
No, no. See - they, no, see, they only deal with me. Ya feel this, this nervousness on the phone there, they're very - these guys're dangerous -
Yeah, but -
Huh? Yah?
I wonder if I could take just a minute of your time here -
Uh-huh. Well, I'm a police officer from up Brainerd investigating some malfeasance and I was just wondering if you've had any new vehicles stolen off the lot in the past couple of weeks - specifically a tan Cutlass Ciera?
Okey-dokey, thanks a bunch. I'll let you get back to your paperwork, then.
Yah, like I told ya, we haven't had any vehicles go missing.
Yah, I see.
Well, I would know. I'm the Executive Sales Manager.
Ma'am, I answered your question.
Yah, real good.
Pretty good, Mr. Lundegaard.  You're damned hard to get on the phone.
Yah, so we're all set.
Yeah, but we have an audit here, I just have to know that these vehicles you're financing with this money, that they really exist.
All right, Jerry, you got this phone to yourself?
Well, yah, I got an idea. How's that Ciera workin' out for ya?
Things have changed. Circumstances, Jerry. Beyond the, uh... acts of God, force majeure..
Yah.
Be back in a minute. If Stan calls you, just tell him I went to Embers. Oh, geez -
You told me about it.
I mean a parking lot.
I thought you were gonna show it to Stan Grossman. He passes on this stuff before it gets kicked up to me.
Well, you know Stan'll say no dice. That's why you pay him.  I'm asking you here, Wade. This could work out real good for me and Jean and Scotty -
Stan Grossman looked at your proposal. Says it's pretty sweet.
No kiddin'! I'd need the cash pretty quick there. In order to close the deal.
...Huh?
Yah.
I'd be very surprised if our suspect was from Brainerd.
Yah? Well, what now, d'ya think?
Yah.
No way.
Uh-huh.
Yah, that's a good one.
Geez, that's a good lead. The Blue Ox, that's that trucker's joint out there on I-35?
Aw, you can sleep, hon.
Yah, I'm down in the Twin Cities and I was just watching on TV about these shootings up in Brainerd, and I saw you on the news there.
Yah.
Yah, ya know it's the Radisson, so it's pretty good.
And then I, and then I been workin' for Honeywell for a few years now.
It sounds like you're doin' really super.
I always liked ya so much...
Yah.
We've got a -
Don't go in! Wait for back-up!
Love ya, Margie.
You bet. Thanks for lunch. What do we got here, Arbie's?
They're good, Norm, but you're better'n them.
Your mallard?
Norm, that's terrific!
Oh, for Pete's - a course they do! Every time they raise the darned postage, people need the little stamps!

Give me a minute, Marla, alright... just sixty seconds.
Absolutely, you have every right.  I need you to do me a favor.
I've done you enough favors.
I can't let myself see where you're going.  Go wherever it takes you, remember... keep away from major cities...
Uh... I'm sorry.  We met on the plane.  We had the same briefcase. I'm... you know, the clever guy.
What?
Okay, everyone.
Why?  So you can say, "Oh, that's what you do." -- And be a smug little shit about it?

It's called a "changeover."  The movie goes on, and nobody in the audience has any idea.
It affords him other interesting opportunities.
No.  That's a good thing, isn't it?
The fight.
This fight, pussy.
My dad.  No question.
After I graduated, I called him long distance and asked, "Now what?"  He said, "Get a job."  When I turned twenty-five, I called him and asked, "Now what?"  He said, "I don't know. Get married."

Why wasn't I involved from the beginning?  You and I started fight club together.
I want to know --
What do you want to know about Project Mayhem?
I don't think that's true.
... is over.
But, when you fall asleep, I do things without you...
This isn't possible...
We're going to have to do something about Marla...
What... what are you saying?
I'm going to...
This is the beginning.  We're at ground zero.  Maybe you should say a few words, to mark the occasion.
Noooo, please...
I swear on my life, I won't...
Did I tell you I'd call you a fascist dickhead?!
Ain't that something?
Thank you.  Thank you, sir...
I... I don't know...

That's why Death is working backwards. It's tying up all the loose ends, sealing the rift once and for all This chapter of the screenplay contains scene that do not appear or occur elsewhere in the final movie. In order to maintain the integrity of the screenplay, it has not been edited.
Carter.
What about you, Kimberly?  Did you anyone from Flight-?
What?
I've got to stop and help those people.
I'm Officer Burke.  I'm looking for an Isabella Cruz.
Yeah, I hate to love and leave ya, but I've been over this X-Files shit since the sixth season.
I never mad it.  The Greyhound bus I was on splattered some chick all over the road and we had to stop.
Like I said, it was like I was there. I remember everything.  The sounds of the crashes, the smells, the look on Shaina's face...
...My Premonition was just like his.
Evan Shaeffer's dead.
They're next on the list.  We have to find them.
How do you know?
You said she was going to drive into a lake.  How can she when she's in protective custody?
I think a nurse named Kalarjian is going to choke Isabella to death!
No time.  Keep going.  I wouldn't know how to explain any of this anyway.
Yeah, don't make me cite you for harassment.
You have everything, Kimberly? Credit card, cell phone, AAA card?
I know, Dad.
What feeling?
He's not a witch.
Remember the gate number?
That's total bullshit. You can find death omens anywhere you want to.
Don't do it! Don't do it!
All I owe is these people.  To live my life to the fullest.
But I saved him. I intervened. Just like the plane. That's the design.
They're watching me, see if I go to Alex.
Yeah.  It's not hard once you get the hang of it.  In the wrist. Anyway, I did what I always do when I get one...
What just happened?
Read you.
Batteries not included.
This is state-of-the-art firepower.
Where's your stuff?
There's a compass in the handle.
There are no worse places.
What's that?
American?
Can't tell.  Pretty tall.  He's real scrunched up in that thing.
I go up to this camp two months ago. Nobody there.  Empty for years.
It's nice there.  He's probably digging every minute.  Got a surfboard.  Breaking girls' hearts.
Let's go.
Took bus, most of way.  I knew you would come here.
Yeah.  Got some business there. What are you gonna do?
It doesn't hurt.  Why doesn't it hurt?
Let's get that tent down!
What?
Can you walk?
This just occurred to somebody, now?
It's an awful thing, let me tell you. My Aunt used to say,  "divorce is the sister-in-law of death".
I can't believe you lived with her for that long. If I had to live with my mother, I'd stab myself six times.
Got any more bread crust?
Most men are.
Anne, they're MY moods. If you want to understand moods, have one of your own!
Two kids tried to set me on fire.
I... I stayed at a friend's.  Listen, I --
Oh stop.  Things will change.  My Aunt Mary always said, there's a remedy for everything in this world except death and having no class.
And who's Lydia?
Well, what the hell does that mean?
All right... I'll pack my stuff tonight.
Terrific. Going on alot of dates ... seeing lots of men... lots of dates..
What if I was a relative?
<u>I tell him no visitors</u>!!!
Oh please!...I was born a Catholic in Brooklyn... I've been to hell and back.... I'll be fine...  ....Thanks...You're a gem.
You're so witty.  I'm so jealous... I <u>need</u> to get out of here, Jack, and do something other than sit in this apartment and count how many funny lines you have per page.
You know, tomorrow's a very big day for me... It would be nice if you acted like you understood.
Well, since you're a member, we could...
Tonight!  How's tonight?
No... no... that's all right... I thought I knew her... Thanks...
A quest?
Listen... I don't mean to be flippant or to enrage you or anything but... you're an imbecile.  And I'm not The One... I'm not <u>any</u> One...
I wish you all the luck in the world. When you get the Grail, I'm sure I'll be seeing lots of you on various talk shows...
Please don't hug me in public again, O.K.?
I'm not. Believe me. <u>I'm</u> scum.
You're a real honest to goodness <u>good</u> guy.
WILL YOU PLEASE... please listen to me ...  You know none of this is true -                           PARRY the Grail, the voices...                           Jack... There's a part of you that                         Come on...what are knows this isn't true.                             saying... I know who you are...                              I know who you are.. or who you were.                                   You're acting really- You don't belong on the                            No, no, no, no... streets. You're intelligent                        Jack... man....you're a teacher...                         Jacck!... You were a teach at Hunter College. Don't you remember?...                               
The Red Knight!
Well, maybe he wants to stay here.  Do...do you want to stay here?
It's a classic.
Bingo!
Bad example. Just trust me. A woman who loves you keeps you going...gives you strength... Makes you feel like you can do anything...
I'm sorry....I'm just so excited.  You must have felt this way when you first met Anne, huh? Where did you two meet?
OWW...MAN...
You won't be alone for long.
No just Parry.
It sounds exciting.
Don't say that.
Well, it's enough for me.
You don't have to say that.
I mean you don't have to say nice things to me... That kind of thing is a little old fashioned for what we're about to do.
Well... you're walking me home.  I... I guess you're sort of... attracted to me and you'll want to come upstairs for... coffee...
Well, no wonder.  We just met, made love and broke up all in the space of thirty seconds and I can't even remember the first kiss which is the best part.
No, I...
Yeah, 'cause she's so "twinky"...
Well, Betty and Twinky, it sure is nice talking to you girls. I just wish I had more time...
Your little friend's real sharp there...  Yeah, I don't like to wear the wig on TV, because with two and a half million people watching you, you've gotta be sincere. I just like to wear it when I'm out slippin' around bowling alleys an' things like that. I think it gives me a little more class, don't you?
I hope that's all you gotta say, El, 'cause I'm about as tired of your mouth as I am workin' this stinkin' hole!
You're the pathetic one, not me.
You go slippin' around in front a my face, an' in front a Elton an' Stoney. What do you imagine they think a someone you treat that way...
"You'll be burned out/Or smoked out/An' come back to me, I know..."
What the hell is that?
I 'magine it's me then, id'n it?
Well, is that a happy face I see?
Oh, am I holdin' up dessert?
Alaska.
No, but it was very clever... I would of just punched her out.
Am I on TV?
Well, I don't claim to have sold 'em all. They still have some left, I believe.
Well, you seem very professional...
Don't, then.
Crashes into a Jeep and totals his neck.  That's Carl...
A week or two isn't going to ruin your life, for Godsakes.
No, no, I don't think that, I'm just curious about it...  Do you think I'm a freak?
You're attractive, Tita. If you just did a little more with yourself...
Oh, let's not talk about my hair, it does what it wants to, and anyway, who cares, I want to talk about you...
Yes, intentionally.
I don't know. Let me give it some thought.
Tomorrow, then.
Well, at least you're accomplished at something...
Yes, that's what's important to me...
I don't believe vou.
I can't do that. I haven't been being fair to Carl. I have to tell you that.
Please, I'll see you later this evening.
Just give me a chance, will you?
Is she?
For two whole weeks, an' there wasn't hardly nobody there to talk to but me. The manager of the place told me it was the off season, an' it must a ben, because other'n me, there was just this 25-year-old kid, DeLyon, that didn't appear to be all there, an' this old married pair next to me that was always hollerin' for quiet. Can you imagine? All you could a heard there was a pin, an' them, hollerin' away...
I do eat slow as a bird, whereas Bobby can put it away like a speed swing...  Is there any ketchup around?
Oh, uh huh. I had a little kittycat once, that Bobby give me...
It is true.
Jesus, what a rude person...
A dispose-all, what's that but more crap? I've never seen such crap. Oofh, I don't know how people get up in the morning.
Bullshit! Truck drivers know the best eating places on the road.
There's some good things on it, though.
Not now, I'm busy
I, umm, came to see you.
That's it?
You look good.
Yo, can I talk to you for a minute?
Wha'?
I can't man, I'm punished!
Pitt.
If we were at 10th Street Pool you woulda done it right in the water, right?
You said before, that he got boxes?
A girl named Amanda.
I'm a good friend of hers.
Unbelievable.
Comanche Indian.
Would you like me to change anything?
What?
I wasn't asking.
Fletch.
I see. And what do you do for a living, Mr. Fletch?
I'm President of the International Fletch Corporation.
It was planted on me, sir.
My God, you're serious.
Ask anybody.
We play tennis at the club.
Really. The California Racquet Club?
Right, and how long have you had these pains, Mr. Barber?
Mrs. Smith.
Joan or Margaret Smith.
I'm sure it's not for a lack of looking. Maybe I should get a real complete physical. You give Alan an annual, don't you?
No, not for sure. When it comes, it comes. You gonna want some shit?
Affirmative.
You don't have a piece of the action?
What?
Can I get you something?
Well, I didn't want to say anything, but I thought the dead man was my brother.
That's it.
This was last month. So Alan Stanwyk does not have cancer.
It stinks. I thought woman were independent now.
This is no joke. If some kind of payment isn't made, we're going to have to contact the paper and garnish your wages.
The thing that really tipped it off for me was something your wife said to me while we were in bed together.
Isn't that nice. Good man. Showed the Japs a thing or two.
California. San Berdoo. Utah's part of my route. Can I ask you a few questions?
That's right. Alan comes by every three weeks or so.
And they're still married... Alan and Sally Ann.
Mrs. Stanwyk, may I borrow this picture. I promise to send it back to you. It's routine, really. The actuarial people need to --
No problem.
What's that?
Nugent. Ted Nugent.
Alan Stanwyk.
My company has taken out a very large insurance policy on me. And I have a wife. Suicide would nullify my insurance. Murder does not.
What's the difference? The noise'll kill you first.
Sure, all drifters do.
They serve dinner on the flight?
What do you say, Mr. Nugent? You'll be doing me and my family a great service.
Sure.
Spot right here.
I'm sorry?
How long have they been married?
No, thank you.
It's John. John...  Znhcneelsky.
I ordered lunch.
I saved his life during the war.
No. He was. I got him out.
Your bone structure, shoulders, neck...
Trust you? I may seem a little goofy at times, but I'm not a complete Bozo, you know.
I decided I was going to tell my husband about you today.
But first I called the Hall of Records in Provo. They checked on the deed. You're telling the truth. A minute later Alan came in the room and asked me why I was shaking.
Bastard.
I don't have all the pieces yet, but I'm close. I'll know tomorrow.
You can't do that.
I would, actually.
No wonder.
Go ahead. Call them. Better tie your shoelaces first.
Practically.
So let's go! We run the pictures.
Yeah. It's wedged in between Wyoming and Nevada. I'm sure you've seen pictures.
What about finding the source?
I have some ideas.
Very possibly. Come on, say yes. I'll buy you a shirt.
It's also called getting me this close to being murdered.
You'll have it.
Fletch, I got nervous. Please....
Mrs. Stanwyk, I hate to disturb you. Tom Underhill here... I'm a new member.
I just stepped out of the shower! Can you give me a minute?
No, I ain't got you...
Who's your decorator?
I don't have a sense of humor, either.  Sorry.
Nuthin'.
Nonsense.  After what you've been through, it sounds like I owe you.
I'll buy you a new one.  I found her.
I'm not cynical.  Can I help it that life is a disease and everyone's a victim. So you're producing exclusively for Grendel Records now.  Hope you're taking Julian for a bundle.
Great pipes.
Tell me about it. Name's Kyle Troy.  Can't we bring up the bass.
Keep it.  It's your paycheck this month.
Spooky.  I'll process her.
Shut up, goodies from the ice queen.
Hello...  It's Colleen.  With answers.  She wants to meet.  Down.  Way down-town.  Late.
Johnny's C.D.?
But the funny thing is, take a look at these Swiss bank account numbers. We got Bobby, Johnny, Colleen... and Julian Grendel.
Give me your gum and grab the wheel.
Peachy.
I'm so sure!  I'm an only child and my parents are Bill and Shirley Petals of South Bend, Indiana. They run a hardware store and...
Come again?  B.FL.D., I have sex with rock stars; it's not like I'm doing something that I don't enjoy with them, like shuffleboard. Don't worry about me, I practice safe sex and next summer, I'm going to U.C.L.A.
No.  Who's Art Mooney?
Hah fluck, great video, huh?
Are you okay?
Sorry, it was dark, now come on.
Reality-reality-reality -- Outrageous building, huh?
Tell me, Dr. Watson, what makes you think he's not just another piece of shit overdose.
He, he, lives in South America... he's doing that anthropologist- archeologist-dentist kind of thing ... he's real busy.
You think you're so hot just because you can get into any club. You think you're so hot, just because you have sex with great- looking women.  You think you're so hot just because you broke the Ensenada tape piracy ring...
Why do you hate me?  It's gotta be more than Me Private You, You Cop.
That's okay.  I'm quitting the music detective business to become a cop killer.  Pay's the same, but it'll be much more fun.
I'm off it!
Mmmmmmm.  Mmmm, mmm.
I must say you're an island of reality in an ocean of diarrhea.
And if I told you that you already knew all that shit, and that you had them killed, what would you do then?
Ah, I didn't say seven <u>P</u>.M., now did I?
Before Black Vomit starts its set, Don will have his head blown off. The papers next week will reveal that he was partners with Bobby, Johnny, and Collie in 'the Grendel Records scam.'  He killed them to pay off a debt to 'the mob' or something lame like that.  And then the mob iced him.  It's all more tasteful than it sounds.
Oh, wait.  One sec.  Open the window.
Oh please, Ford, I'll do any --
Yeah, it's pretty amazing how much cash you gotta give to the actual artists who create the music.  Those ingrates really take a bite.  But seriously, when Pops died, you got Vomit, Crunch, and Sutton to help finance a C.D. Cleans operation. You got greedy and they tried to get the three discs together to threaten you, but...
It's my daughter, man.  I know I never told you about her, but God, I love that girl.  She calls herself Zuzu Petals and she's been swallowed up by the gorgeous hell that is L.A. A fucking groupie partying with the pros.  You have to get my baby back, she's my pride and --
You don't use shit?
Well try, okay?
Did you ever sit on the edge of the bed, take off your socks and stick your fingers between your toes?
It is waiting for you in the garage.
My friend, I am not sure about what is going on -- but for me, I am finished.
Hell no -- my end is covered -- my associates just feel we ought to wait for a more opportune time to make the switch.
Si tu veux.
Je n'ai jamais vu tant de sérenité. Elle m'a demandé de tes nouvelles et si nous étions heureux.
We must follow it.
Gimme a break, Mr. Russo.  I'm in show business.
Get up on the bar and show me how you work.  If I like it you don't have to go in.
Marseilles.
Yeah, I know.
Willie Mays.
I hear the health department is going to close this joint for selling dirty beer.  I come by to help you carry out your money.
A piece of ass wouldn't kill me.
Morning.  Sometime.
Nothing in there except a New York street map.
Tumble it.  One end to the other.
What about the last of the big-time spenders.  You make him?
Give who a tail?
He was the bank on that shipment outta Mexico three years ago.
This could be it, Walter.  This Candy Store guy, putting on a big show in a fancy nightclub with known connections all over him. Then on our own, after working the whole day and night, we tail him out to Brooklyn and sit on him for a week practically, and who do we come up with?  Joel Weinstock.  You gotta let us have it.
Four.
Whatta you got?
Whyn't you get it dry cleaned and burned.
What is that old building?
For dead bodies.
Don't know what's behind it.
Hey, bud.
Did he?
He did.
Nothing.  I just wanted to see you.
One in each ear.  What would you do without me?
I've been talking to this...guy...this cop...on the HAM...and, uh, he...
John, hold on a second.  I'm in the middle of something important here.  You mind if...
Do you know where I found this?
No.  This isn't what you think.
Okay, okay.  I need to go say something to Julia and finish up with the guy on the radio.
He's not gonna stop, Satch.  He's gonna keep on...
Glad to hear that.
Daddy, Daddy, I can't.
Wait...
Fed up?  Lemme tell you something, in a 1000 years, when school kids study America, they're gonna learn about three things: the Constitution, Rock 'n' Roll, and Baseball.
Yeah.  It was all over after Buford nailed Seaver's first pitch outta the park.
Wasn't too tough, buddy.  Game happened almost thirty years ago.
Uh huh...
What if it's not...
We gotta be bouncing off the mother sun spot of all time.
Yeah, that's how Hams work.
Nah, I gave it up.
That can't be...that's not gonna happen.
Tomorrow.  Jesus...it hasn't happened. It doesn't have to happen.
Chief?!  Is that you?
Yeah, it's me.
Are you alright"?
There was this case.  A serial.  He murdered three women, all nurses, between '68 and '69.  The papers called them the Nightingale Murders.  They never caught him.  But the killings just stopped.
I'll warn them.
Tell 'em there's a homicide in progress... cause by the time they show up there will be.
No.
I don't think I can.  I'm not a cop.  I can't.   I can't stop this guy.
No, he tossed the wallet, but he kept the license.
Okay, okay...
Call the FBI.  Use a pay phone.  Don't give 'em your name, Dad.  Just tell 'em that it was Shepard who killed Finelli and Clark and the others.  That he's the Nightingale.
I don't remember.  Why don't I remember?
Go in where?
Yeah.  That's it.
I'm sorry Sam couldn't make it.
Are you a good cop, John?
Then I'll bet she's real proud of you, huh?
I mean, is there any place in particular where we can drop you off?
We were looking for something to keep our hands busy.  It was either this or an orgy.  Vera chose this.  What're ya gonna do?
I did?!  I broke the world's record.
Actually, I have no idea what the World's Record is.  I was just kidding.
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
Sounds disgusting.  Let's go.
What?
Sure.
Chuck... look.
And Hell is hot, but I ain't goin' down there either.
Don't do that to me!
You can say... "Hello, how are you?"... for starters.
What?
Uh... I guess I'm just not hungry.
Just a dirty window.  Next time, I'll know how to handle a situation like that.  Let's just hope that "next time" isn't too soon.
Look at it this way... things can only get better... Right?
I never said you were "nothing".
Why?
This is taking forever.  I'm starving.
Tommy, my father is out looking for you right now.  Something happened tonight and he's sure you're responsible.  If he finds you, he'll...
'Cause it stinks.
Well, Nancy, I'm Paula... remember?  This is Sissy, and we're gonna be right out there all night so nothing can hurt you. Okay?...
Which is?
Will you listen, dammit!
No.  Not here.  Come by my house tonight at eleven.  Don't be late.
I need to talk to you.
I'm kind of busy right now...
You know he's not...and he's coming for you.
Thirty.  Name your price.  Everyone has a price, what's yours?
Okay, I'll call you later.
'Night, Josh.
You think you can lock me up in this piss-ass prison?  Hell, this place is motel fuckin' six to me.
That's all right.  I was just...
I'm now begging you.
Yeah...
I'm gonna get your outta this.  Just hang tight.  Okay?
-- Bad?!
She's a waitress at Joey B's but she needs some extra cash.  Ward's the pimp.
I'm literally going to kill you!
Really?
What are you going to do?
You're joking, right?
It's not that, it's just that...  It I get caught, I'll lose my science scholarship and everything.
So there's no reason for him to come back because there won't be any of us around...right?
And I'll never do it again. Forgive me?
This is Jason's fault!
Nothing.
They're out of town.
Since the school is closing anyway, I'm going to write that novel I've been threatening on everybody.
There's something I haven't told you...
Only one young boy ever drowned in that lake, and that was before you were even born. His name was Jason Voorhees.
Hi, Sean.
But I didn't get you one...
Forget it. It's a dumb little thing anyway.
I'm not going near any lifeboat!
I'm not!!
Drugs...  Then Jason came. He's here, Sean.
I opened thousands of brains.
You are going where?
I don't want to hear about it.
That sounds so final. But are we really surprised?
I can tell you the year, the day, the night, the minute.
Suffering. You exude a person who sits in a small dark apartment eating soft white bread.
Tonight. What's tonight?
What was it like?
I think we Nought to wait.
I'm not ready.
I don't have the problems that artists have.
What about the haircut?
Where is it?
Keep going west. Last building before the river.
Yes. What are you implying?
This could be it.
You know about Adele.
What about her?
Our Peter?
I go to college. I thought you knew.
What do you want to talk about? I'll talk about anything. What's this?
You're too young to be studying criminal behavior. It's making you obsessive.
I didn't turn her into Mother. You did.
I have a class. I'm late.
Everything.
Brilliantly moving.
I've seen it twice. I went back tonight to be sure. It's a brave and honest piece of work.
The whole thing is my fault. I took unfair advantage of your patience and understanding. You understand me.
You know why, don't you? Because I am patient, chain-smoking Lillian.
It violates so many trusts.
This place becomes famous. Tour buses. Blind people feeling around for bullet holes in the wall.
A thousand things.
Life is real.
You know the answer to that.
Of course they're gonna lose. We'll watch them lose. What good is heartbreak if we don't experience it firsthand?
But the son is suppose to stop crying.
You didn't think it was okay when you lived here. You wanted to get out so fast I thought you were running a marathon.
Everybody else does. Why not you?
Matthew, look at him. When I lived in Roxbury, the media followed this man everywhere. He was bigger than ten movie stars.  Where's your white Lincoln limo?
Wife and daughter. My father's still alive. He outlives me, starting tonight. Because the Mets just tied the score. It was only a matter of time, wasn't it?
An how many years does it take a person to make his family safe and secure and happy, and then in one dumb moment, what does he do?
Postpone. We have every right.
Eleventh inning. What else?
Get the hell out of here. I don't want you bringing our food. Send a real waiter.
Mine was cobalt blue.
That's the line I can't ever, for the life of me remember. I just can't get it.
I was in the fish-market play. What happened to him?
Not one of Steven's finer moments.
I was one of those silent, listening children. Glued to the shadows.
Steven goes to extremes to protect his privacy. No friends. No phone.
And I thought, at last, she's here, she wants me.
I am your wife.
Nothing's more dangerous, especially for an old man.
There are unjust laws -- as there are unjust men.
An eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind.  We must stop.
If you did this, no one could control it. No one.
There are a few million miles to go yet.
You want to give your child the best possible start.  Believe me, we have enough imperfection built-in already.  Your child doesn't need any additional burdens.  And keep in mind, this child is still you, simply the <i>best</i> of you. You could conceive naturally a thousand times and never get such a result.
No, <i>this</i> is your man.
--What <i>about</i> his profile?
So there's a 20 percent chance he's <i>not</i> dead.
--I've already run it.  There's no record of any living relative.
Don't underestimate these imposters.
From what budget?
We have to be certain.  Once they're up, we can hardly turn the boat around.
Thank you, no.
He's probably leaving some more of me around the place before he goes.
What's wrong with him?
Six one.
German.
You had to be a right-hander.
Hey, how much of you can be there?  Even if the "J. Edgars" do find something, in a week--  you'll be slightly out of their jurisdiction.  Come on, we've got to get drunk immediately.
You're going to have to earn your supper.  I've got my final physical tomorrow.
You know I'm scared of heights.
--I walked right in front of it.  I was never more sober in my life.
We can't stay here.
They think I offed the Director.
You know how it is with these altered births --somebody told her she's not going to live forever and she's been preparing to die ever since.
You're not thinking of telling her, are you?
Don't worry about your little pin cushion. To be honest, I'm looking forward to having the place to myself.
I got the better end of the deal.  I just lent you my body--you lent me your dream.
Vincent, come down.  I've found him.
How tall are you?
I've found him too.
I was at home.
Yes.
So we don't know for sure about you, either.
No.
Those checks take forever.
Let's walk.
It's not safe.  I shouldn't have brought you here.
Come on.
Honey, you've made <i>one</i> mistake--
Not like <i>this</i> one.
No.  My old lady must have made a lot of promises.
I want to take a walk.
Small town, small bank, big money.
It's all right.
Really?
I couldn't have... much longer.
Usually on the right side as you go in.
If we are clean Gollie will take us over at Nogales. If we are hot we'll have to try Laughlin at El Paso.
Waiting's hard. You never learn how.
I see it...
Call the ranch, tell Beynotr we'll leave his cut here --
You sent me to him.
I'll bet you can.
When they find it, they find it.
I think you liked it with him.
El Paso.
What's wrong?
Get in the shower. You'll feel okay.
Whatever you say.
So what?
Get your clothes on, move your butt.
Thanks. I hope yours is okay, too.
That little job cost me a hundred dollars... didn't even get to keep the fish.
Tell her you robbed a bank...
Yeah. I got out.
What about you?
Two.
Wire pull over?
Whatever you need.
Mexico. I'd like to find a quiet place to cross.
I kinda doubt it.
Not now.
'Bout five thousand.
That's what I want.
Wish you hadn't said that. When Slim Canfield's lips are sealed, they're sealed.
Go with God.
The three of us are going to do some traveling. We're going to take your car to El Paso.
I'll tell you when.
A couple of weeks back.
What did you do?  Albert?
Nothing. What could I do?
Fine. Nowt wrong with them.
How'd it happen, then?
I know.
I don't know. All I know is that people were shitting bricks up at his place last Saturday. Your brother's name was mentioned. Next day, he was dead.
Good evening.
That's very kind of somebody. Who do I have to thank?  What happens if I miss the train?
He was all right to me.
But he was just another feller, wasn't he?
Who?
Yes.
He came to see Mr Kinnear.
Yes, while he was here.
Of course. Where else?
Very lucky, I should think. You're drunk!
And what was that?
What kind of entertaining?
The girl's name was Doreen. That's all I know.
Have another?
Yes.
At the Half Moon.
Yeah. He comes in here a bit.
How many?
Who's Brumby?
How'd you find me?
No, I didn't,  Does Albert Swift still live over the ferry?
I'm sorry. Here. This'll pay for a course in karate.
I'm staying with a friend.
Definitely.
You sure?
You don't look it.
Make us a nice cup of tea and I'll tell you. I might even let you watch.
No, you won't.
No.
I'm going to sit in the car and whistle 'Rule, Britannia'.
Jack Carter.
Oh, you've been watching television.
That's not always a healthy way to be...
Oh, Cyril, eh? So it's all girls together, is it?
Nasty way to go.
But they have to be diplomatic.
Ask Jack. It's his old stamping ground.
Three hundred altogether?
Ha.
Shut up.
Deadbeats all.
Where am I going to work?
I had to.
The whole fuckin' thing...The pressure's just too great.  You're ab...you're absolu...they're too important.  All of them.  You go in the door.  I..."I got to close this fucker, or I don't eat lunch," "or I don't win the Cadillac..." We fuckin' work too hard.  You work too hard.  We all, I remember when we were at Platt...huh?  Glen Ross Farms... didn't we sell a bunch of that..."
Eh?
Eh...?
River Oaks, Brook Farms.  All of that shit.  Somebody told me, you know what he's clearing himself? Fourteen, fifteen grand a week.
The leads, the overhead, the telephones, there's lots of things.
What act?
That's the God's truth.  And it gets me depressed.  I swear that it does.  At MY AGE.  To see a goddamn: "Somebody wins the Cadillac this month.  P.S. Two guys get fucked."
You don't ax your sales force.
You...
They...
Graff?  Because I worked for him.
Talking about it as a...
Hey.
No.  Not actually.
For five thousand?
He'd give me a job.
What?  What?  The leads.
You have to steal the leads tonight?
They'll know when you go over to Graff...
Yes.  I'm sure.
I didn't ask to be.
Yeah.  That's swell.  Yes.  You're right.  How are you?
Huh?
Yes.  They are old.
He filed half of them, he filed the big one.  All the little ones, I have, I have to go back and...ah, fuck, I got to go out like a fucking schmuck hat in my hand and reclose the...  I mean, talk about a bad streak. That would sap anyone's self confi... I got to go out and reclose all my... Where's the phones?
At home.
When I talk to the police, I get nervous.
In school.
I want to work today, that's why I came...
The leads come in, I'll let...
Did they find the guy who broke into the office yet?
How the fuck do I know?  What...talk to me.
Are you talking to me?
Which, wait a second, which is not until the check is cashed.
The people downtown said...
Could I...
Anyone in this office lives on their wits...  I'm going to be with you in a second.  What you're hired for is to help us--does that seem clear to you? 
And let's put this together.  Okay? Shel?  Say okay.
...I only...
...you talk to Murray...
Let me...
Fuck him.  Fuck Murray.  John?  You know?  You tell him I said so. What does he fucking know?  He's going to have a "sales" contest...you know what our sales contest used to be? 
Yes.
...they kicked out.
The leads are assigned randomly...
I can't do it, Shel.
Not lately you can't...
No.  You're right.  That's for later.  We'll talk in a month. What have you got?  I want two sits. Tonight.
I'm not sure I have two.
That's what I'm saying.  Yeah.  I'd like something off the other list.  Which, very least, that I'm entitled to.  If I'm still working here, which for the moment I guess that I am.  What?  I'm sorry I spoke harshly to you.
Somebody broke in.
I talked to Murray and Mitch an hour ago.  They're coming in, you understand they're a bit upset over this morning's...
On an eighty-thousand dollar day? And it ain't even noon.
What are you trying to tell me?
...excuse me, nothing, you be as cold as you want, but you just fucked a good man out of six thousand dollars and his goddamn bonus 'cause you didn't know the shot, if you can do that and you aren't man enough that it gets you, then I don't know what, if you can't take some thing from that...  you're scum, you're fucking white- bread.  You be as cold as you want. A child would know it, he's right.  You're going to make something up, be sure it will help or keep your mouth closed.
If you tell me where the leads are, I won't turn you in.  If you don't, I am going to tell the cop you stole them, Mitch and Murray will see that you go to jail.  Believe me they will.  Now, what did you do with the leads?  I'm walking in that door--you have five seconds to tell me: or you are going to jail.
That was easy, wasn't it?
You've got a big mouth, and now I'm going to show you an even bigger one. 
Where have you been, Shelly?  Bruce and Harriet Nyborg.  Do you want to see the memos...?  They're nuts... they used to call in every week. When I was with Webb.  And we were selling Arizona...they're nuts...did you see how they were living?  How can you delude yours...
Call up the bank.  I called them.
Eighty-two thousand dollars.
Na, fuck the leads, I'm going home.
Shit.
Shut the fuck up.  Ricky.  You have a mean streak in you...  And what the fuck are you babbling about...? 
...Shut up.  Decide who should be dealt with how?  Is that the thing? I come into the fuckin' office today, I get humiliated by some jagoff cop.  I get accused of...I get this shit thrown in my face by you, you geniune shit, because you're top name on the board...
Hey, big fucking deal.  Broke a bad streak...
From the store.
Like you taught me...
Bullshit, you're...No.  That's raw... well, if I did, then I'm glad I did.  I, well.  I locked on them.  All on them, nothing on me. All my thoughts are on them.  I'm holding the last thought that I spoke: "Now is the time."  They signed, Ricky.  It was great. It was fucking great.  It was like they wilted all at once.  No gesture...nothing.  Like together. 
I wanted to speak with you about...
Ray is director of all European sales and services for American Ex...  But I'm saying you haven't had a meal until you've tasted...I was at the Lingks' last...as a matter of fact, what was that service feature you were talking about...?
Oh!  For the magazine...
What do I...?
Who did she call?
That's what they are.  Three business...I wait till Monday, my time limit runs out.
The check wasn't cashed?
It's not me, it's my wife.
We're going to speak to her.
She won't listen.
What...?
Forget the deal, Jimmy.  Forget the deal...you know me.  The deal's dead.  Am I talking about the deal?  That's over.  Please. Let's talk about you.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on, Jim.  I want to tell you something.  Your life is your own.  You have a contract with your wife.  You have certain things you do jointly, you have a bond there...and there are other things.  Those things are yours.  You needn't feel ashamed, you needn't feel that you're being untrue...or that she would abandon you if she knew.  This is your life.  Yes.  Now I want to talk to you because you're obviously upset and that concerns me.  Now let's go. Right now.
You going to turn State's?
Guess who?
Sittin' on top of the world, sittin' on top of the world, everything's fucking peachfuzz...
Oh, and I don't get a moment to spare for a bust-out humanitarian down on his luck lately.  Fuck you, Dave, you know you got a big mouth, and you make a close the whole place stinks with your farts for a week. "How much you just ingested," what a big man you are, "Hey, let me buy you a pack of gum. 
I have the stuff from last year's...
It was nothing...I was assuring Mr. Lingk...
On your pillow.
I know.  How long will you be gone?
Bought at the airport.
Relax, Freddie honey.  Come dance with me.
I'm getting out of here I said; these guys all have guns!
Mike, what can I do, she's a hysterical woman...
 My two friends have my share of the money.  I'll have to speak to them after we deliver these to the wholesaler.
Forget it, just go take care of her.
Johnny Ola... Hyman Roth.
I never looked down on you, Fredo. You don't look down at a brother.
Wait'll you see!
It was hard to have him killed.
Sincere.  What are you talking about, of course I'm sincere with you, Mike.
But, you told me yourself...
It was never Pentangeli... I've always known that.  It was Roth all along.  He talks to me as a son; as his successor, but the old man thinks he'll live forever.
What do you want me to do?
We have time.
He said there was something good in it for me...me on my own.
Some guys from Ninth Avenue jumped Fanucci today; slit his throat from ear to ear.
That's off now.
I don't know.  I'm sorry, Kay...
You don't know that's true.  But Kay, just for the sake of an argument, let's assume it is, I'm not saying it is, remember, but... What if I gave you what might be some justification for what he did... or rather some possible justification for what he possibly did.
With Mama, putting the baby to sleep.  Francesca's very happy. Michael was kind to her.  She idolizes him.  The children are all out in the speedboat.  I'm going to my house.
I can feel it in the way he talks to me.
I wanted to tell you alone; your wife doesn't know what's going on.
Yeah, give me a minute.
Will we...be able to get who ordered it out of them?
But if you're wrong...
My information is that Fredo thought it was a kidnapping.  Roth assured him nothing would happen to you.
What is it, can't you give me straight answers anymore!
Roth engineered it, Michael.  He made Pentangeli think you hit him. Deliberately letting him get off alive.  Then the New York detectives turned Frankie over to the FBI.  My informants say he was half dead and scared stiff -- talking out loud that you had turned on him and tried to kill him.  Anyway, they had him on possession, dealing in heroin, murder one and a lot more. There's no way we can get to him and you've opened yourself to five points of perjury.
I want it met.
Your plans are a little different this time.  You skip Miami, and go straight to Geneva.  It's to be deposited to this number.  And it's got to be there by Monday morning, no slip-up.
That's my brother.  Nothing could get him away from that two mule town.  He coulda been big over here -- he could of had his own Family.
Thanks, Tom.  Thanks.
A little; what's so thought- provoking about that?
Maybe two, three thousand dollars.
Sir, my client has answered every question asked by this committee with the utmost cooperation and sincerity.  He has not taken that Fifth Amendment as it was his right to do, and which because of the extreme legal complexity of this hearing, counsel advised him to do. So, I think in all fairness this committee should hear his statement and put it in the record.
The witness is excused; take him out.
This meeting is adjourned.
Yes, Michael.
In a minute.  They're outside with Esther.  I'm very happy for you... I suppose I knew that you're simply too smart for anyone ever to beat you.
Why too late?
There are still things I have to do.
We do favors for each other...
Technically, they are still under the Clemenza wing of the Corleone Family, now run by Frankie Pentangeli.  After Clemenza died, the Rosatos wanted territory of their own.  Pentangeli refused, and came to me, asking for permission to eliminate them.  I, of course, knew of their relationship with you, and in gratitude for your help with the Tropicana matter, turned him down.  Pentangeli was furious, and paid one hundred and fifty thousand dollars to have me killed. I was lucky and he was stupid. I'll visit him soon.  The important thing is that nothing jeopardize our plans, yours and mine.  This thing of ours, that we will build.
It's always bad for business; but you have no choice.
Jake, Jake, come over here.  Mike, I want you to meet Jake Cohen; he manages the casino for us.
He appreciates your concern, Michael, and your respect.
Okay.  You know he doesn't have that kind of money.
Do you have interests or control over gambling and narcotics in the state of New York.
Frankie, you know my father respected Roth, did business with him.
He did business...but he never trusted him.
Trust me; do as I ask.
Frankie, Roth tried to have me killed.  I'm sure it was him, but I don't know yet why.
All right, then let me say you'll pay me because it's in your interests to pay me.
No sign of them yet; but they're still on the Estate.
You weren't straight with us, Frankie, what else could we do?
Maybe, yes... maybe no.
How much more a month?
Like hell!  And who the hell are you to give me orders.  Watch your manners or you'll be on your Sicilian ass in the street there.
Just thinking out loud.
If he were that famous, he probably wouldn't give me the time of day. This way, he's like <u>my</u> famous person.  Yeah, my own personal famous person.  Who treats me like I'm somebody worth talking to.
Yeah, and I'm never going to smoke another cigarette.
All the old men I know think about nothing but sex.
Hey, no strings, right?  That's what you always said.  Just good pals who have the hots for each other.
I didn't mean to...
No, I'm actually kind of glad it happened.  It made me wonder what the hell I was doing with my life. Letting you pull me into bed whenever the spirit moved you.
I'm not a kid.
No!
I blame my daughter for keeping me out so late.  I only hope you did not get him excited.  It could give him a new stroke.
He says here good-bye.  I find it in his room.  He is sorry, he says. He has had a wonderful life.
We have his note.
And your name is --?
Excuse me, but -- are you famous?
They're just copies then.  Gotcha.
What was wrong?
What's to sketch?
You don't want to draw pictures of me in my birthday suit, right?
Pish posh, Mr. Boone.  I'm not your Aunt Tilly.
That's exactly what I intend to do.
I've spent most of my life outrunning my past.  Now it's flooding all over me.
All right, I guess.
I assume you worked up an appetite with your labor.
I liked it.  We all did.
What is we say phooey to the hedges?  Could you spare an hour after lunch?  To sit for me?
Or a husband.  Depending on which of us you asked.  My friend David. He lived here for many years.
You don't think of me that way, do you?
The world is just one kiss-ass game after another.  A man has to make up his own life, alone.
Thoreau with a lawnmower.
You've done a helluva lot more than most people.
Better work.
From now on, Mr. Whale, I cut your grass and that's it.  Understand?
You're talking through your hat now.
You don't want me to sit for you anymore?
Do I look okay?
Nothing would please me more.
Exactly.  Cukor was too cheap to hire music.  There's nothing but chin-wag.  The cold dreary custard of English chin-wag.
David.  The friend I thought was in New York.
David produced her last picture.
Monsters?  The only monsters...  ...are here.
We're not sugar.  We won't melt.
Good.  Let's get dry.
By the time he was ready to ship out, the fighting was over.  He missed out.
A very lucky thing indeed.
"A perfect night for mystery and horror.  The air itself is filled with monsters."
There are straps in back.
What was that?
Oh, but you feel good, Clayton.
Fuck off!
You told me to get you up, asshole.
Ooooh.
I think I'll hang around.
I told you.  I don't turn on the TV except for the fights.
I was, until last night.  Publicity asked me to fly Miss Taylor in for today's reception.
In a manner of speaking.  I've never encountered the olfactory hallucinations, but I'm sure they're related.
Nonsense, my dear.  You look extraordinary.  Today's script.  Quick.  And a pencil.
Perfectly all right.  But if you'd like to sit --
What's our pesky friend up to now?
Good-bye.  So nice to see you...
Yes?
And this is your house.  Wow.  The house of Frankenstein.  I thought you'd live in a spooky old mansion or villa.
Is it now?  Hanna?  I think we'll take our tea down by the swimming pool.
Twenty-one.  The romantic comedies and dramas were much more to my liking.  The horror pictures were trifles.  Grand guignol for the masses.
Let's make it more interesting.  I will answer any question you ask. But, for each answer, you must remove one article of clothing.
You're serious.
Then the rumors are true?
You must understand how Hollywood was twenty years ago.  Nobody cared a tinker's cuss who slept with whom, so long as you kept it out of the papers.  Outside of Hollywood, who knows who George Cukor is, much less what he does with those boys from the malt shops along Santa Monica?
Righto.  Let me see.
Bet you thought you'd never see me again.  I didn't know if you'd be well enough to come to this party.
You, Mr. Kay?  How do you know George Cukor?
Don't think that, Mr. Whale.  I love your movies.  That's why I wanted you to come to this.  So I could see you with your monsters.
A boost. A big boost ...
Maybe she don't know. Although I don't see how that could be. Maybe she didn't want to upset you -
I do ...  Christ, what happened to us ?
Yes ... Kip ...
Get out --
I hope you know what you're doing. God help you if you don't ...
Look at it. I can't very well make delivery of that thing ...
You spend enough time down a man's throat, you get to know his tonsils. Do it ...
Leg's all banged-up. He made a stupid play ... He'll limp around the yard up at Folsom. But Astricky will be there to take care of him. With their priors, they're looking at a serious bounce --
Get out of here, then. Now.
Yet your still here ... I gave you 24 hours, 24 hours ago ...
You betcha --
Just out there. Roaming around. Building up my collection of refrigerator magnets ...
You seem a little hinked-up ...
It's the same way with cars. Different cars. Different tunes. You can't steal a Maserati listening to Sinatra. You gotta get urgent. You gotta get Sonny Rollins or Led Zeppelin IV, on that shit. But never, never-ever take no Allman Brothers into a Lincoln Town Car. Could lead to disaster. Got it... ?
C'mon, man ...
Gray.
We'll have to start beating the bushes, find out where they live...
It's arright ...
Dignity...
I couldn't. I didn't want you to worry. I thought held sort himself out. I hardly see him. He comes and goes. He's in trouble, isn't he?
Mother -- !
I'm cool -
Hello, Memphis --
Easy ... Take it easy ... We're almost there...
Sure --
"About what?"
What?
I can handle it --
Not really ... But you know... Maybe I'm wrong ...
I like how you wallop back in here - after four years - and can still get all Clifford Huxtable on my shit ...
Come here -
Toby...
I gotta get my tool --
And you got some Italians -- ?
Hey -
That what you want?
Okay.
No ...
The alarms go off ...
I bet you say that to all the girls...
With a twist of my wrist ... You're turned over ...
What about The Club ... ?
Seeing if you wanted to go for a ride?
She does have one thing you don't.
What happened? Old-age happened. I tired of killing them. I woke up one morning and thought I am no longer a destroyer. I am a means of resurrection. Now. We restore. We revive. There are so few things in this life, we can prevent from decay. Most must die. These don't have to...
He's gotten involved --
I appreciate your dilemma, Memphis. But how are two washed-up thieves and an old man supposed to boost 50 cars in three days...
He's gonna be okay. Could do a bit.
Sure. Hey, Toby. You grew up
Sixteen. But my birthday's in seven months ...
Right. You want to test the voltage drop ... Use the voltmeter ... Remove the primary lead from the ignitioncoil and crank her ... See what you got ... You understand -- ?
I known Kip longing than you, man ...
The oldest one.  He was in an argument. A lousy ten-dollar card game. The kid pulls out a gun. It goes off. The kid gets killed. The grandmother hears it and finds out he's been arrested. She has a heart attack.  She drops dead right on the spot. Now Jeannie's got a husband and son in jail and a mother in the funeral parlor.
Billy, how are you?
Listen to him.  "Watch the suit," he says.  A little pisser I've known all my life.  Hey, Tommy, don't go get too big.
Come ooonnn. Tommeeee. We're only kidding. You can't take a joke? Come ooonn.
They don't feel like you're in construction.
The bag with the envelopes.
Don't lie to me. I saw her name in the register.
You want her to visit you?  Good! Let her stay up all night crying and writing letters to the parole board.
It's only you and me. That's what happens when you go away. We're on our own. Forget everybody.  Forget Paulie.  As long as he's on parole he doesn't want anybody doing anything.
I can't do it anymore.
Don't worry about it. You listening to me? Now, come on. We gotta go see Paulie.
What's going on? What happened to Stacks? Is everything okay?
Who gives a fuck? Tall her he ran away with a broad. What do you care about her.
He's hiding, thE son of a bitch, in Florida.
I want you and Anthony to go down there and take care of that bastard. Without him, they've got no case.
You're some fucking jerk.
Tell Michael not to 1et the sauce stick.
Yeah, yeah.
Tommy, come on. Put the gun away.
I hate to do dishes.
He's a grown man. Be doesn't have to call every five minutes.
What? Come on!
Watch what happens.
Jesus Christ. Not even close.
I don't know.
No, I had to talk him down.
Well, I don't have no trousers on...
--and he's like "shit! Motherfucker!" And he looks in his rearview and sees this cat-- I'm sorry--
Yeah, he was probably drunker than my Uncle, who fuckin' knows? So the cop goes "Stay here" And he goes runnin' down the highway to deal with the other crash. So, my Uncle Marty's standin' on the side of the road for a little while, and he's so fuckin' lit, that he forgets what he's waitin' for. So he goes, "Fuck it." He gets in his car and drives home.
So in the morning, there's a knock on the door it's the Statie. So my Uncle's like, "Is there a problem?" And the Statie's like "I pulled you over and you took off." And my Uncle's like "I never seen you before in my life, I been home all night with my kids." And Statie's like "Let me get in your garage!" So he's like "All right, fine." He takes around the garage and opens the door --and the Statie's cruiser is in my Uncle's garage.
The fuckin' Trooper was so embarrassed he didn't do anything. The fuckin' guy had been drivin' around in my Uncle's car all night lookin' for the house.
Why don't you beat off at your house?
Shut the fuck up.
You thought we forgot, didn't you? I know I'm gettin' my licks in.
How'd you like that course?
What is it?
--But--
Will, this is Sean Maguire. Sean, Will Hunting.
I'm pretty sure it's right.
So am I.  Yes. That's right, Will. Most days I wish I never met you. Because then I could sleep at night. I wouldn't have to walk around with the knowledge that someone like you was out there. And I wouldn't have to watch you throw it all away.
You're from the same neighborhood. South Boston.
Can we do it at my office?
Cutting edge mathematics. Think tanks. The kind of place where a mind like Will's is given free reign.
What don't I understand?
I do.
That's a wonderful theory, Sean. It worked wonders for you.
--Gerry--
--And here I am for the second week in a row with my professional reputation at stake--
Hold on!
He can handle the work, he can handle the pressure and he's obviously handled you.
Oh, come on, Sean--
--And why does he hang out with his friends? Because any one of those kids would come in here and take a bat to your head if he asked them to. It's called loyalty!
That's it. That's why I don't come to the goddamn reunions! Becaue I can't stand the look in your eye when you see me! You think I'm a failure! I know who I am. I'm proud of who I am. And all of you, you think I'm some kind of pity case! You with your sycophant students following you around. And you Goddamn Medal!
--I don't want your trophy and I don't give a shit about it! 'Cause I knew you when!! You and Jack and Tom Sanders. I knew you when you were homesick and pimply-faced and didn't know what side of the bed to piss on!
I don't blame you! It's not about that! It's about the boy! 'Cause he's a good kid! And I won't see this happen to him-- I won't see you make him feel like a failure too!
I got one of those too.
You should come. I'll buy you a drink.
I don't got a crush on her.
Buddy, two seconds ago you were ready to give me a jump.
Have you read all these books, Will?
Whatever blows your hair back.
Oh, "Starry Night" time, huh?
Maybe what mea--
How'd it go?
I don't know.
Haven't called her.
Hence, the word remarried.
I gave that up when my wife got sick.
I was havin' a drink with my future wife.
I don't know.
Define that.
Someone who challenges you in every way. Who takes you places, opens things up for you. A soul-mate.
Not to me, they're not.
Nobody gets what they ask for, Will. That's a cop-out.
Why is it a cop-out? I don't see anythin' wrong with layin' brick, that's somebody's home I'm buildin'. Or fixin' somebody's car, somebody's gonna get to work the next day 'cause of me. There's honor in that.
Yeah, I think so.
You're Welcome, Will.
I'll keep in touch.
Stanford. I'm leaving in June after I graduate.
No.
Hey, I spent all my money on those caramels.
Pretty boring, I guess.
Yeah.
What, five?
I swear to God.
'Course I do, they're my brothers.
I've never seen your place.
Exactly.
They don't come over here that much.
Rich? I have an inheritance. It's two handred and fifty thousand dollars. That's exactly what it'll cost me, minus about five hundred bucks, to go all the way through med school. This is what I'm doing with that money. I could have done anything I wanted. I could have expanded my wardrobe, substantially.
I guess. I don't know. How do you remember your phone number?
So, do you play the piano?
--But you can do my O-chem lab in under an hour, you can--
Yeah, but how do you know?
I inherited that money when I was thirteen, when my father died.
What about your twelve brothers?
You don't want to hear that I got cigarettes put out on me when I was a little kid. That this isn't surgery
I never cared about that.
Well, I'm contracting the land.
*Some*body got to take the blame. They just *got* to hang it on somebody, you know.  An' I ain't doin' nothin' but set around.
But ain't no reason--
No. Ain't ever gonna be scared no more.  I was, though. For a while I thought we was beat--*good* an' beat. Looked like we didn't have nothin' in the worl' but enemies--wasn't *no*body frien'ly anymore. It made me feel bad an' scared too--like we was lost... an' nobody cared.
That comes from not holdin' you tight *enough.*
We got to get outa here right away. Ever'body here? Where's Uncle John?
I don't know what these cops got to do with it but I don't like it.  An' these here are our own people, all of 'em. I don't like this.
Was he bruised up this mornin'? About the face?
What's it to you?
Two.
Okay, mister. Whatcha payin'?
Two and a half cents.
Two an' a half! Say, mister, a man can't make his dinner on that.
Got a warrant?
I got nothin' to preach about no more--that's all. I ain't so sure o' things.
Maybe you should a got yourself a wife.
I don't mind any more. I'd do what I done again. I killed a guy at a dance. We was drunk. He got a knife in me and I laid him out with a shovel. Knocked his head plumb to squash.
It don't matter. Ever since I lost the sperit it looks like I just as soon go one way as the other.  I'll go your way.
I ain't gonna run.
Well, if it ain't Tom Joad. How ya, boy?
But jus' the minute they ain't strike- breakin' they won't get no five!
Lissen, I heard that before--
Little trouble up ahead, but you'll get through. Just follow the line.
You ain't gonna blow nobody nowhere. First place, you'd get hung and you know it. For another, it wouldn't be two days before they'd have another guy here to take my place.
Oh!
Crossin' the desert in a jalopy like this.
Five they're a-gettin' now, an' that's all they're int'rested in. I know exackly what Pa'd say. He'd jus' say it wasn't none a his business.
Ain't a-goin', thas all...
California.
You take that plate inside the tent an' you eat it.
Pa! Shh!
It sure is hell jus' tryin' to get enough to eat.
Don't taste bad.
That's right. And douse some in it.
Was Granma bad?
I was afraid they'd stop us an' wouldn't let us cross. But I tol' Granma. I tol' her when she was dyin'. I tol' her the fambly had ta get acrost. I tol' her we couldn't take no chances on bein' stopped.
You promised, Tommy.
Girl with a baby *always* gets prettier.
I could hide you, Tommy.
How'm I gonna know 'bout you? They might kill you an' I wouldn't know. They might hurt you. How'm I gonna know?
Good-by, Tom. Later--when it's blowed over--you'll come back? You'll try to fin' us?
I don't wanta rob you, ma'am.
They come. They come and pushed me off.
I can't help that. All I know is I got my orders. They told me to tell you you got to get off, and that's what I'm telling you.
Casy, won't you say a few words?
No. I'm jus' gonna set awhile an' then go to bed.
Awright, go on! Ain't nobody stoppin' ya!
What's this?
You people looking for work?
Well, there's plenty of work for you about forty miles north, this road just outside Pixley. Turn east on 32 and look for Hooper's ranch. Tell 'em Spencer sent you.
I work at Kentucky Fried Chicken.
What?
Sure. Listen. Why don't you join us up in the grandstands?
It's me. Martin Blank.
Really...? So what?
Really?
You could've been a contender, huh?
So you eat-- read it everyday?
That's it?
More like what happened? What happened, Mr. Blank?
Well, you'll have a ball. You seem to have everything everybody wants when they go back. The car, the suit, the watch. The look. That just leaves the little things, like happiness, character, point of view...
I'm sure you've done worthwhile things in the last ten years. You've had experiences.
Bad experiences.
No time.
It's something I do...
Like, that there's a point? An organic connection between all living things.
I'm staying here.
That's because I speak human, and you speak monster.
We've spent a lot of time discussing those years. Remember we said that fear is a transfer of the bodily hurt associated by experience with the thing feared, to the thought of the thing. Thus we fear a dog without distinctly imagining its bite.
In fact, I think I talked with him, in Bonn.
I get it.
Wait. I have Mr. Grocer for you.
There's nothing to be done about it.
Paperwork on the Detroit thing. It's a full dossier. Very comprehensive.
I have to call the client and give them a reason why you're late.
His assistant. He acted like Marlin's son, only he wasn't. At least they never said he was... I bet they were lovers, faggots. Yes, gay lovers. Wild Kingdom my ass!
Nature made him then broke the mold.
Yes, they give me headaches. I have a headache.
I was catching up with Bob Destephano.
I have to get my head back into my work.
I took the other road. I'm more of a self-reflective young lion who does business with lead-pipe cruelty and goes home to drink light beer in milky-eyes isolation. I love sports and sex and have no real relationships with anyone. And you?
I am very sorry, ma'am. Goodbye now.
Doesn't matter.
Branding?  I haven't branded in years.
It's a man's world, Mr. Booker. Most women have to.
Well, maybe I am laughing a bit... I just thought, as long as you're here, it would be nice for you to relax into the place a little.
If I can survive rush hour, I figure I can handle grizzlies...
Oh yes. I forgot.
Ha, ha... all right, well, uh I guess you can bring out the pasta.
Is that your version of a pep talk?
Grace, I put it on the table near your --
Well... how you feel all right about telling Liz to put him down...
Mom?
-- enough time tomorrow. I know.
Fine.
You don't.
I don't believe this!
Thanks, honey.
STOP IT! Why can't I talk to you!!
NO, YOU STOP IT! Stop pretending like you care! Like this really isn't about you and Tom.
WHAT?! How can you --  I'm sorry if my friendship with Tom bothers you so much, but I happen to value having someone to talk to, especially when my own daughter ignores me night and day because no matter what I say, it's wrong and no matter what I do, it's wrong... I'm sorry I'm such a disappointment to you.
Well, now you know what it feels like.
My period.
Uh, nothing. I'm going to pick it up in the other room -- would you hang this up for me?
Hi.
If this magazine is so important to you Annie, why are you in Montana?
Sure... What's Grace up to?
That's okay. We have to talk about it and we're not always in the same place ... so... I just have to get used to it.  What do you want to do about dinner?
No, let me go.
Doing what?
I'm not asking you to. I'll do it.
I'm in charge. I went back very soon after the accident. They didn't expect me for a couple of months. I'll just take that time now... I can still oversee things from Montana... Take my fax... My computer...
You don't have to explain. You have every right to come.
You want to take a walk with me?
Well, get born a bull, got a ninety percent chance of getting castrated and served up as hamburger. On a balance I reckon I'd choose being a cow.  Would you mind passing that salad young lady?
No imposition. Plenty of food. Gonna get pretty dark soon. Hard to find a place.
Always did. I think she favored him a little. You tend to when you have more than one, even though you love 'em all the same.
I got a little confused though. The ranch Ellen was talking about -- that's not this one?
Oh, God -- I think it was the fourth or fifth time I'd been there, so all I remember was the heat and how incompetent the photographer was...
I don't think anybody can make Tom do anything he didn't want.
He's a good man, Tom is. He's got a gift, come from heaven above, I swear. But he's still a man. And a woman can lead a man into the middle of a mountain lake -- and still make him think he's on dry land.
Weekend after next...
You know her?
Mmm. An editor.
It's more or less how it sounds. Sometimes it's not pretty to watch. Some horses fight it real hard. Your fella's already shown us he likes a good fight. So if you don't want to watch, I'll call you when it's done.
Why don't we just cut through the woods?
The number's by the phone.
You ever miss it?
About horses? I'd love to learn more about it myself. Do you offer any private lessons for riders?
Yeah, cool.
Alright sir.
See, we're very busy. A TV network that wishes to remain nameless has expressed an interest in our show.
Was that her top?
This is Zero Cool, man! Whooo, haha!
Meet Cereal Killer. As in Froot Loops? But he does know things.
Ain't no way, man, security's too tight. The big iron?
You're psyched. You need to lay off of that shit.
Yeah, I bet it looks crispy in the dark.
Yo, hit the lights.
That's it, you're looking at it, he just looks slick all day.
I'm sorry. Who are you?
Nah. I don't play well with others.
I told you, I don't play well with others.
No, you're not in my class.
It's cool, I'm just looking.
It's too much machine for you.
You wish. You'll do shit work, scan, crack copyrights, whatever I want.
And if I win?
Okay, thank you.
How?
Thanks for your help.
Yo, chill man, I'm talking to Venezuela.
Yeah, I'm sorry, I was just looking for the principal's office.
Let's echo 23, see what's up.
The rabbit is in the administration system.
Yeah! You better figure out what's on that disc, cause we're being framed. It's in that place where I put that thing that time?
Virus?
What, it left a note?
Yeah. To civilians. But they're hackers. But don't worry. All we have to do is launch the Da Vinci virus, and then they'll all be put away.
Don't get angry.
I don't know Brady.
So you hop on to the next best thing? I thought you were different from other guys.
Oh really? Well, I'll just let you get back to little Ms. Hot panties.
Michael Myers.
Brady!
Not tonight. I've got that date with Brady. You know how important that is.
What am I supposed to tell Brady? Sorry, but I've got to baby-sit my foster sister, go and have fun by yourself.
Its not exactly the end of the world, for goodness sake
We'll be at the Fallbrooks. The number's next to the phone.
I told them to be here by nine. Its not 9:30 yet.
You know damn well about what.  You let them take it out of here.
Haddonfield. It's a four hour drive. You can reach me through the local police. If you didn't find him in four hours, I'm sure I will.
If Loomis read memos he's be here. Fortunately his position is more ceremonial then medical. My hope is that he's either transfer, retire, or die.
Got it Earl.
Okay, out.
I can't sleep.
It's been eleven months.
Double scoops. Now lets get some breakfast.
Yeah, hurry up.
Yeah.
Don't you mean what you do best?
Hi Jamie.
Okay, bye.
The state police won't know how to stop him.
I'll be there in 5 minutes.
Making sure that no one can get in here.
He's been here.
Batteries. I planned the generator for the house next week. I wished I hadn't waited.  This is squawk 79er zero of Haddonfield broadcasting on the state police emergency frequency. Can anyone hear me?
Car trouble?
Someone broke into the hardware store. Probably kids.
Subtle, isn't he? Hey creep!
Cute.
Annie, was that you?
Well, I just talked with Ben Tramer and he got real excited when I told him how attracted you were to him.
You guys will make a fabulous couple.
I'm glad you're here because I have something I want you to do. I want you to call up Ben Tramer and tell him you were just fooling around.
Totally...
Want a beer?
Are you sure?
Yeah, sure.
It's important.
They may be right.
You all right?
Sure...
Nothing's going on. Just kids playing pranks, trick or treating, partying, getting high... I have the feeling you're way off on this...
I found the car! He's here!
Where?
It's your own fault and I don't feel sorry for you.
Okay. Later.
See you.
Tommy, let me in!
Be quiet! Get Lindsey and get into the bedroom and lock the door!
It's the bogyman, isn't it?
I've given them his profile.
I'm wasting time.
Your compassion is overwhelming, Doctor.
What does that mean?
Are you really interested?
Oh, yeah.
No, really, we mustn't get discouraged.
Oh, in this we're a big hit. Yesterday I auditioned for Come Back Little Sheba.  That, I wasn't such a big hit.
...a monstrosity!  Who would do that?
Uh...
If...well, if we took the, if we took Fifth, then-then-then we'd get to your house first, yeah?
Oh, uh, listen, David called me up.
Look, it's just an evening at the opera.  Did I, I-I do wrong in accepting?
I can't resist.
Really?  How flattering!  Did you try the shrimp puffs?
And it ruins everything else.
Well...
Yes.
Mm-hm.
Well, this guy's the real hypochondriac of the family.  I mean, he's, you know, he's--
Yes, a little dizziness, and I think, I think I'm developing a hearing loss in my right ear  ...or my left ear, my, my left...oh, n-n-n-no.  No, I'm sorry.  It was my right, my right, my right or my left ear.
The hospital?  What kind of tests?
Look I-I-I'll be okay.  I'll be okay.
...with the affiliates.
Oh, I don't know.  My unemployment checks are running out.  Um, I was thinking of taking some courses at Columbia with the last of my savings.
How-how's Frederick?
Bye.
Oh, you know...I talked to Hannah this morning on the phone, and she said that you two might be going to the country for the weekend.
Oh, yeah, that's really nice of you.
He's got like six gold records.
What are you doing?!
I...I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm sorry.  I have to talk to you for... There's so much that I want to tell you.
Why?
Is something wrong?
Mmm.
Yeah, I know.  I-I can't believe I forgot.
Because it's the last thing in the world we need right now.
Yeah.
Oh, honey!
How can we be happy?
But why?  We raised you as a Jew.
So?
Absolutely.
You're not going to abuse them. They're all so sweet.
Because I have to!
I'm sorry.
So you met somebody else?
You are, you are my only connection to the world!
Oh...
You know... 
You--I got the classic symptoms of a brain tumor!
I--How was I to know?!  Everyone was pointing back here.
Yes, but doesn't that ruin everything for you?  That makes everything...
I know, I know, and your hamster.
Hi.  She's auditioning for a television commercial.  She said she's gonna be a little late.
Oh, yeah?  How's she doing?
I can't believe Elliot and I can't think of someone nice for you to go out with, you know--
I'm okay.
Oh, no!  I mean, everyone thinks things like that.
I know, she...she really writes good dialogue.
I think he'll find that satisfying.
H-he's so awkward and he's clumsy like me...
Thanks, thanks.
What, by a st-stranger?
I want to experience childbirth.
No!  I like to joke around and have fun, and he gets angry because I get the attention.  He's gotten sourer as he's gotten older, and I've tried to stay young...at heart.
Now, Holly's not shy.
Two thousand dollars.
Oh!
Well, I think he was dying to open up.  It's so sad.  Now...what should I wear to my audition?
Singing?
No!  No, I, eh, it's just that they sing.
I know, no--  I know.
Look, everything's going your way.
They said I was too offbeat looking, whatever the hell that means.
Oh, what do they know?
Uh, losers!  All losers!
Yeah, we're having some problems, but problems that are my business...which I don't see how you could know about in such detail. How does Lee know about these things?  How?  They're private!
Listen, you are witnessing genius!
At least I'm open to new concepts!
This crowd wouldn't know the difference!  They're embalmed!
We didn't hit it off.
Yeah, it was.
You didn't answer my question. What are you doing?
Oh, no, millions of people come up to you and say, "Hey, I have something I just wrote," right?
Nobody ever said it.
You have.
...Hannah read it, she got really angry, and... you know, then I felt badly, so I--
Really?
I thought it was wonder-- There's maybe one or two things in there that I would do differently myself, but...
I need an antihistamine.  Mom thinks she's feeling her asthma, and so...
At least she isn't drinking.  Did you notice?
Get a garter belt...  Get a garter belt and flirt.
Take our literature...
You've gone off to America, on your <u>Vacation</u>...
Perhaps you did not have the <u>support</u> you required.
I would have figured you an R.N. by now, or, maybe Med School.
I'm struck by your phraseology.  I did not <u>last</u> with him.  I was privileged to enjoy his company during that time.
Did you ever think, did you think, after he escaped, he would come after you?
...very good.
You said "here's what <u>they</u> want you to do..."  Why?
Not as much as being jailed for theft of Government Property, or for failure to pay income tax, on undisclosed income.
You want me to be?
Let's keep it to business, shall we?
I feel...  I feel they're Out to <u>Get</u> Me...
That's right.
...his family has offered a large reward.
Doctore Carlo Fanelli, curator of the Pallazo Capponi, 2 months missing.
...what a world.
You spend the afternoon in Bed?
First things first.
...are you alright, sir...?
The children...?
...Mr. Verger would be pleased to make a contribution, to the charitable...
Yes, I did.
Let the girl go.
You seen John Brigham...?
One moment, I'm not done with you...  Give him the file...
Evone tells me:  I shoulda been in, fi, six, months ago.... thizz my first checkup.
It gets, um... it gets so lonely sometime.
Waal...
And how do we account for the interest of such a charming man, an interest in Torture?
Then, she, <u>herself</u>, possessed some knowledge of the Greater World...How pleased am I to see you looking so well...
No, this is <u>pleasure</u>...
And what was the trip <u>before</u>...?
You have a recent scar on the back of your hand.
...your <u>scar</u>..?
Carpal-tunnel syndrome.  From a life of typing.  Commendatore.  <u>History</u>, a hazardous profession.
I <u>sense</u>...  The faintest <u>whiff</u> of a perfume, whose <u>base</u>, whose <u>base</u>, whose <u>base</u> is "Hamamelis" ... it is <u>witch-hazel</u>--such a clean scent.  No, not a European scent. I would say it is a scent of the New World.  I would say, you have been in America.  Have I struck home?
You know America?
Yes, of course, and we'll <u>collect</u> them. I won't be a minute...
With Mama and Shirley and Stringbean.
Yes.  Franklin, you can't live there anymore.  With Mama and Shirly and Kittykat.  You have to go away.
Thank you, that's not responsive.  How did our Miss Drumgo get...
I'd prefer you to say what you feel.
Thanks to <u>you</u>...
Freud, do you know...?  Freud psychoanalyzed patients in One Afternoon.
You don't wish to <u>beg</u>...?
Explain in depth the plan we have for him.  Until tomorrow.
The girl needs help.
...might I make a suggestion...?
Yeah, but who would marry friendless <u>me</u>...  Howabout you, Romeo...?
You stay offa this Alphabet Soup Detail, all this half-baked, cowboy stuff, till after you get your <u>mind</u> cleared.... you don't wanna go out there a half-step <u>slow</u>...
What do you want to do?  You want to jam up that sonofabitch Krendler.
Yeah.  Well.  They're a talkative buncha commentators.
They aren't expensive, you got them through your connections.... speaking of which:
...they asked us to dinner.  How can we accept if we cannot <u>return</u> the...
Because...?
The Case that I am <u>working</u> on...
It's a <u>joke</u>.  You're a joke.  You're a joke.  You don't know what money <u>is</u>-- your idea of money...  ...spend it on a whore on your 'business trip.'  That is the fine limit of your ambitions...
I know something no one knows.  He has had his finger removed.  On his left hand.  It left a scar. 
I'm sure there is, but my young Friend here, would <u>kill</u> you. 
Is it necessary to say of the sea that it is salt, that the stars are far, that...
Yes.  I think I <u>do</u>.  I think it is a phrase you used with that woman.  You told her you were an <u>orphan</u>.  You <u>used</u>, to your mind, your most private fears.
Your father.  It is not <u>they</u>, who...
Well, no...  That's... I appreciate your <u>help</u>, but... 
I saw a man today, a man so hideously deformed who'll spend his life in a hospital bbb...
What's wrong with approval?  You admired that man.
...you <u>are</u> an orphan.
Welcome to the human race.  Do you know, there are people who admire you?  Reasonable people.  Why don't you <u>find</u> them...?
And you've decided to get <u>married</u>.  You've decided a <u>lot</u> of things.  But, in spite of your decisions--you are still "nagged" by feelings of:  <u>despair</u>, of <u>failure</u> of... you still have the <u>nightmare</u>, you...
You want some <u>advice</u>.
When?
Yeah...Are we going to do it or what? I still haven't packed.
But, but that was before we started sharing stuff. Before I told you how I cried when Peepers died. I never told anyone that before.
Was there a night that I got really drunk and declared that I never loved anyone as much as I loved you?
It is?  I don't know about this, Wichita. Am I even right for Talia?                         ] What About Wendy?

Everything.
Yes you do.
It's okay, there's a lot of things I don't believe in...
"Iunno." I'm really beginning to hate that word of yours. I'm sorry for sounding hostile, but I'm not sorry for...
I love you. Don't say I love you, too. I hate that--"love you, too."
Shut the fuck--!
It's so great to be able to talk to a girl and not have to ask "What's your major?" I hate that.
Phil Collins? Are you sure he isn't drinking and driving?
Hey really, I don't feel so great.
I don't know, it was okay, I guess.
Oh yeah, that's it.
Something like that. Will you do it?
Heather, I feel awful, like I'm going to throw up. Can we jam, please?
No. Hell no.
Did we? How the hell'd you get in here?
Don't worry. I'll ask you to do me a favor. You'll get the negatives and everything back then.
That's the punchline. She's still alive, in stable condition. Another case of a geek trying to imitate the popular people of the school and failing miserably. Is that pate?
Sure.
I didn't. Cherry.
A well-timed lightning bolt through her window and Monday morning, all the other heathers, shit, everybody would be cast fucking adrift.
Well then, I'll pray for rain.
See the condoms in the grass over there. We killed tonight, Veronica. We murdered our baby.
I'm just a little freaked, all right?  You got what you wanted, you know.
Did not.
I was just making it more special.
I was thinking more along the lines of slitting Heather Duke's wrists open and making it look like a suicide.
I don't get it! You were wrong! I was right! Strength, damnit! Come back!
Nag, nag, nag, nag. nag.
You want to wipe the slate clean as much as I do. Okay, so maybe I am killing everyone in the school because nobody loves me. You have a purpose though! Remember? Let's face it, the only place different social types can genuinely get along with each other is in heaven.
Let's kick his ass.
Cool off, we're seniors.
I guess.
May<u>be</u>. There's kind of a dark horse now in the running.
This condescending junk makes suicide seem like a cool thing to do. Hey kids, make your parents and teachers feel like shit! Get the respect in death you'll never get in life.
That's three things.
It rained everyday of my Maui vacation, but hey, I didn't kill myself. I'm Whitney James, Commentary.
Actually, Mr. Rieper . . . it's a novel, and we'll be sending it to New York. That's where all the big publishing houses are based.
whips off her pinny as HERBERT leads Juliet into the dining room.
Is it hurting, dear?
What now?
Bye.
comes in with a breakfast tray: bacon and eggs, tea and toast.
starts to cut up a slice of bacon and offers it to Pauline.
You may have forgotten that you were once a very sick little girl, but I haven't!
Do you think Juliet could stay here while her parents are away?
I'm educating myself!
snatches up an exercise book from a large pile.
These stories are not going to get you School Certificate! You don't seriously think anyone's going to publish them?
is very angry.
Well, actually, Mummy's left that programme now . . she's far too busy with The Marriage Guidance Council.
We don't want to tire you out, dear.
Mummy!
That . . .
What???
All right, then.
What just happened to me anyway? It looked like a dream but it felt like reality.
It's the morphine Trevor. You're on so much of it, you could be asleep and dreaming even with your eyes wide open.
You need to get better first Trevor. Way better.  It's okay to miss somebody. It's okay to still love someone after they're gone. But you've got to quit blaming yourself okay...? Okay?
If they're blocked memories... I'm starting to realize the reason why I blocked them out. Allison I think I really... screwed everything up.
I miss her. I miss my wife.
I'm all over it.
It's inside a moving car.
You just made that up.
If it makes you feel better that took every ounce of self control I had. Trevor, I never date patients.
I understand... I won't-
Eighty four.
In a word? Lucrative.
There is no wisdom, no insight, no plan 
It should all in the report. I told you guys everything. She was giving birth in the fucking car. She grabbed the wheel and I lost control.
That's right Trevor. The timing was impeccable wasn't it? It's been eight months two weeks and three days but we finally found the body. Just need you to ID it for us.
A little? Try unbelievably.
How much do I stand to inherit if Kirsty is presumed dead?
We're just gonna take some blood here.
I don't know who you are or what you want. I just want to know what's under that sheet...
I don't even know what's real and what isn't how can I trust anyone?
You.
Hey you're the guy from down the hall.
One leg!  Like the Red Cross or something?
Come on, John, don't be an asshole. I don't like heights.
What am I, a goddamn postman?  I'm way the fuck up here, I'm scared a heights, and you want me to deliver a letter?  Put a stamp on it for Chrissake!
Well, we gotta work this thing out, John.  It's a goddamn mess an' I'm halfway to doing serious time in the joint an' the TV lady's so stuck on you she don't want it to come out you stole her purse because it might break the heart of millions.  Looka those maniacs, willya?  They love you, for Chrissake!
I don't need to be a hero, LaPlante, but I can't face people... the looks in their eyes... after the trust they gave me!
There was this kid there saying, "Go in there and save my father, mister." And I'm thinking about my boy Joey and this goddamn fireman my wife's seeing. It was like I was supposed to save myself.
I think our best course right now would be to focus on the Probation Officer's report...
He gives a good report and I walk?
Often, uh.
Twenty-five grand is peanuts!  All you gotta do is get me outta here long enough to collect.
So you can call me "naive," Mister LaPlante.
Mister LaPlante...
You don't wanna know, Chick, you don't wanna know.  Those guys been in here?
Ev, it's not my fault!  I'm trying to tell you this incredible --
He's in bed!  You're not gonna wake him and make him crazy, do you understand?  He comes home from the zoo, he wants to know if Elliot's a "war hero" like you... he wants to know how many people you killed...
A lifetime of petty crime climaxed by your sleaziest accomplishment yet...  blackmailing a national hero...
Underbelly!
Listen, Mister LaPlante... uh, Bernie... Who... are... you?
You never saw that picture, huh?
Yeah.  I'll see ya... dad.
Well, I'm not entitled to a million dollars.  I... I... didn't expect... I didn't expect...
John, I'm sure she could support just about anything.  I think I'll see you to your room. A sort of bodyguard.  Make sure no harm comes to you.
Bodybuilding!
You do?
The...Silver...Mike...Award!
Because he was a <u>real</u> hero, Chucky. He was acting out of a deep instinctive decency, not out of some ego thing.  He didn't expect the media to lionize him.  He didn't expect a million dollar reward. He saved fifty-four people because something inside him, some fundamental love for his fellow man, made him rush into that plane when "good sense" told him otherwise. He was willing to settle for some credit cards he sold to LaPlante....  For how much, LaPlante?  A couple of bucks?  Did you give him enough for a decent meal?
He's not <u>supposed</u> to be an actor, that's the whole point.  He's a <u>real</u> <u>life</u> <u>hero</u>, all he has to do is <u>act</u> like a real life hero.  That's the <u>beauty</u> of the <u>concept</u>, the whole <u>freshness</u> of it.  Did she call him back?
An hour after...!  Deak, for Heaven's sake!  Let's give her a night in New York City.  We'll put her and her boyfriend up at a good hotel...
I wonder if you'd mind if we waited for him here, Mister Winston...
Look at the guy!  He just saved fifty people.  Now he's going to disappear. Who is he?
Don't be ridiculous.  I'm a reporter.
Call him back.  Ask him.  I'm a little...busy.
Inspector Dayton, the cop from Robbery Detail who was looking for you.  They caught the guy who stole your credit cards trying to sell them and he wants...
Well, it's for a woman.
Oh -- uh -- girlfriend.
It's great.  It's clean and airy and quiet -- there are trees and flowers.  There's still some fixing up I have to do, but it's coming along.
-- institution.
Actually, I have met someone. There's a woman I think I like.
Listen, no one ever said expressing yourself to the opposite sex is easy, but when the time comes, you have to do it and you <u>hope</u> the outcome will be good for both of you. You come out of solitary and you rejoin the human race, as difficult as that sometimes can be.
Oh, fine.  She's gone away for a little while and when she comes back I've sort of resolved to really tell her how much I care for her.
I am.  I'm really feeling pretty good.  I have a much stronger sense of how far I've come.
A sense of proportion.
Do you do washing machines, too?
An occupational hazard, I'm afraid.
It's a living.
Because you <u>were</u> pretty?
'Who's afraid of the Big Bad Wolf, the Big Bad Wolf...'
You know how sometimes Neil bugs you and you just get up and walk away from him?
Uh huh.
And?
I'm sure that's all it is, honey. Maybe you both just need a vacation.
Neil, don't leave the back doors open -- I don't want Holly near the pool.
What's that?
High end?  Honey, it's a whole new budget.
You wanted furniture too, didn't you?
You want me to bargain at the high end of our range?  -- I'll have a stroke.  I've got to save all my sweat for my meeting in three weeks.
It's a nice pool, isn't it?
And it's a shorter commute.
I know.  It's just having to pass muster with these juniors before the senior partner even agrees to see me.
What next?!  -- A strange bra under my pillow!
I don't care, Philip.  You want to go chasing Barbara Zelman, go ahead.  Just watch out for those buck teeth.
This is a terrific entrance hall, What a welcoming feeling.
How large is your brood?
-- A man.
Would you?
Am I supposed to believe that this guy got shot in the chest six times at point blank range and just got up and walked out?
They appear to be authentic.
Yes.
I'd like you to see this.
It's not a homicide, Lieutenant.
Lieutenant.
A few days ago.
Hey -- somebody want to gimme a hand here?
And what do you think you will find in another land?
We cannot write our destiny, Macleod. In the end it could be you and me.
How long is the voyage?
What worries you?
That doesn't matter.
She's a treasure she is.
She'll soon be of age.
Different places.
You'll no see me again.
Then take me with you.
I don't think so -- but then, maybe you've can guess how a guy with a sword could rob the First national Bank this afternoon -- and get shot six times in the chest by the guard and still get up and walk out?
New York is dangerous place.
Meet me Tratino's at nine.
Yes -- if they were trying to get in -- but what if they weren't?  What if they were trying to get out?
Why?
I do not know -- and even if I did...
Perhaps -- but it comes off none the less.
Why did you wait?
It was not by choice.  A small matter of a mountain falling down on us.  We were trapped inside.  When the time of the Gathering came the urge to go was so strong we tried to claw through rock with our bare hands.  What you thought was the end -- was not.  This is the end.  We are the last of our kind, Macleod.
The police still have a lot of questions for Russell Nash.
Aye -- that I would, lass.
Why won't you ever let anyone help you?
Did they?  You are only a man, different than most -- but still a man.  You feel the same -- want the same.  You want to live.
This check is for sixteen thousand dollars.  That's a lot of cash to be carrying around.
Get to work.
Dead end--it's a clone.  What about the Mustang?
Sonny's a fuckup.  If he pulls this off, fine--life goes on.  But if the cops end up with those disks, we cut our losses.
You won't die if you let me help.
Shut up, goddamnit!  Just calm down!
We're on foot.  We can't get away.
We should give up.  All we're doing is making it worse.
That's why we tied him, dumbass.  Now come here and see this --
There is no way out.
I'm not going to die for this!
The Mexican police would arrest you as soon as it landed.  There's only one way out and you're doing it right now--just keep talking to us.  I think we could make the transition now. Maddox, you good to go?
Only if you try to grab me.  We could've shot you from the wall.
I got the gasoline --
I like it here, Dennis.  I'm never going to leave.
Keeps to himself, more like.
Goddamnit, tell me what you <u>know</u>.  Did the cops go in?  Did Smith have the disks?
Canyon Country.
I think you got no choice.
You said they would be here, goddamnit! Where are they?
You said they would be here!
I still see that boy's eyes.
I'm in no rush.  Maybe later we can talk.
Be quiet!  Listen!
We can use the crawlspace to get downstairs.  Then we can run for it.
I know.
What I want is to help my father.
Mars?  What are you doing?
How can we get out?
Dennis and Mars are in the den.  I'll get your brother, then come back for you. We'll go down the stairs and out the front door, you understand?
Another minute.  Please --
Could you call me back on your phone? Right away.
Stand by.
If you go in, you can't use tear gas or flashbangs.  The whole place would go up.
Did the boy say that any of them are in immediate danger?
Mike found a red pickup abandoned on Flanders.  You see it?
Go, Mickey.
I asked you my name.  You just saw my commission slip.  What's my fucking name?
Dennis hit him.  His head's all big and he won't wake up.  I'm really scared.
Where are you right now?
He has lots of disks.
I can get into the crawlspace from my closet and climb all over the house.
Then you have everything.  You can put them away.
You can let go.
I can't control what happens.  The Sheriffs are running the scene.
I have people in York Estates right under your nose.  If you do <u>anything</u> except what I'm telling you, you'll get Jane and Amanda back in the mail.  We clear on that?
Smith will know.
I'll go in that fuckin' house right now! I'll give those disks to the <u>real</u> FBI, you COCKSUCKINGMOTHERFUCKER!!  And I've got <u>Smith</u>!  <u>I've got Smith</u>!!
They're killing everyone. The Lady Minister! The UN soldiers. They're at the gate.
You work at the Hotel Diplomat?
Do you know how to open the safe there?  Our government needs to use the hotel and the room keys are in the safe. You must open it.
I don't have that much.
How many in your family?
Yes. With some re-inforcements I'm confident we could impose order.
Yes we have.
We think you are dirt, less than dirt, worthless.
Their people?
They're only taking the whites.
Yes. Where are the Rwandan police?
I ran out of bribes. Bizimungu took them away.
The rebels have fought their way into the city. They have many Hutu prisoners.
Give me their uniforms. I will put people at the gate, in disguise.
Oh, Paul, talk to the coat check, please.
What did you overhear?
I understand General, but when I last talked to the president of Sabena he promised me that anyone who helped protect Belgian property would be rewarded.
I admire you, General. How do you keep command of your men amidst such madness?
I am strong, Paul, like a lion.
I'm sorry, General. The cellar is empty.
Your police are at the gate?
I hope we all get to do many things. Can we go now?
Please, General, call and put your policemen back at the gate.
If you do not help me, you will stay on that list.
I committed no war crimes.
No whiskey, no spirits. Your rich cockroaches at the hotel, they will have to do without their scotch. Anyway, I have bled that cow enough Paul.
Everyone must leave the hotel now.
Why sir?
It's an order. Get everyone out now.
The commander is not here.
What cards?
You have our cards.
I need a great favor.
Connections? I have no connections, only favors. If I call to help Victor, a General will think "Paul Rusesabagina is a fool. He thinks my favors are so numerous and so insignificant as to waste them on everybody." Then my hard work is doubly squandered. I insult the General and I do not get to use my favor at all. Please leave these things to my good judgment.
Zozo, get a key for two staff bedrooms. Put these people in them.
No answer. Please send someone to get them, please.
It's alright. This is the only place I can find some peace.
We have to get out of here Tatiana.
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
Sir, no one wants to work. They say the boss has left.
Paul, do everything you can to buy time. I will call you back.
And how the hell are we going to do that?
Running all the bells and whistles we set up to scare hell out of everybody --
I'm just the Greeter -- and in that capacity, I now urge you all strongly to --
What's life, anyway? Waves...? Sound...? Light...? Electricity...? I don't know... Phone lines...?
Okay -- I'll admit it: I'm totally, clinically insane. But I'm still the only one who actually got a check tonight. It's yours -- if you just get me the hell out of here now.
-- no. The basement -- the room with all the controls to this thing: big long iron levers just lying there --
-- not a chance -- there's too much weirdness down there I don't think even bullets are gonna stop.
You're starting to sound like Pritchett.
-- listen to the man --
Let's try down here...
That's crazy!
It's succeeding!
Run.
Better put it on hold 'til we find Pritchett.
So where's the party?
The guy whose hair I do has his own TV show. All I've got is a blow-dryer and a dream.
Cheer up: before the night's through, I'm sure one of us'll get hacked to pieces by somebody or something.
How'd you make your guest list, Price: throw darts at a phone book?
It you really loved me, Steven, you'd find a way to drop dead in the next three seconds.
Must be getting old, Stevie -- you're repeating yourself -- this is the exact same set-up you used for the Son-Of-Sam Hunt back in '94.  Girlie, open up that casket there and see what you find.
-- and who's next on your list?
No. OhmyGod, Pritchett was right -- The house <u><b>IS</b></u> haunted.
Well, who's the damn thing <u>from</u>?
I've designed and built six of these places -- take my word for it, everything's fine.
-- my loss --
Wouldn't know what to do with it all --
I am.
-- I wouldn't worry, Ms. Jenzen: the unexplainable will probably explain herself before too long. In the meantime, let's all relax, have a drink, the evening's young --
-- no more --
Rewind that.
It works.
I can't comment until I get paid.
No, you don't want to go down there. I am going down there. And I'm going to find <u><b>reverse</b></u> on this thing and floor it.
He must've unsealed the room!
You say you saw some activity here?
Why don't you pass me your plate?
Who...is Colleen?
What about all my other stuff?
We'll get it later.
Did you ever see a leprechaun?
Will, maybe we should have separate bedrooms for a while.
You didn't think much about that before.
Were you fooling with the power?
Voodoo stick?  It's nothing like that Will.  You're just being cynical.
I'm sure this sounds crazy to you.
A friend?
You, an imaginary friend.  That's what she calls her.
She's gone!
Aubrey!
You seem to appreciate the local scenery.
I'm ok.
Maura.
Yeah, they told us this was the best.
We'll be there.
So is that what all this is? Someone have a problem with us living here?
And I believe what you say.  But this is TV.  No pictures, no story.
OK.  Be careful.  And lighten up.  Story of your life could be right round the corner.
That is the story of my life.
He'll do what he does best.  But he'll do it unfettered.  He wants to walk the Earth forever, indulging his taste for all the myriad subtleties of human suffering.
Uh ... Hi!  Is this ... er ... Joanne Summerskill?
Joey.  Yeah, who is this?
Right.
Oh yeah ...
Why are you so interested?
It's okay.  It's just someone burned me once.
Yes I do.  Terri, something awful happened to that boy.  I have to find out what it was.
Jeez, I've never owned anything.  I haven't even had a room of my own since I was fifteen years old.
No.  I buy them to impress people.  Of course I've read them.
And he still sits there?
Maybe he thinks it'll come back.
Here!  Here!  Pull over!
Everything sold as is.  No guarantees. No returns.
No.  We want ...
I took back everything bought on a whim, I'd have no business.  I ...
Unh-unh.
God?  My God was diamond and black light.  And I was his Dark Pope.  All that is changed.  A terrible beauty is born.  With a place at my right hand for a man of your tastes.
JP?
Will you relax?  Your little girlfriend left a card, remember?
Really?
Oh, I don't ...
Yes!  God, yes.  I ... I just want to hug you.  To hold you.  To tell you it's alright.
There goes five seconds...My record's eighteen.
Rutherford Auction... that name...
Don't wet your diapers.  I'll have to change them.  "Witchcraft." What's the running time?
Hey, you promised......Don't worry, I'm wearing my girdle.
You re not thinking of going to...
Yeah, I mean, come on, going through the Iron Curtain is supposed to be crawling underneath barbed wire, it's supposed to be strangling a guard...
Why not just go now?
You can be lookout!.....  Take Alex's gun.
I don't want to sound immature, but we were here first...
I can't believe you didn't notice. My weight.  I lost ten pounds in Rome
Get em....
Too-do-loo, babe.
No, your Eminence.  I think he's going to steal the Codex, as early as next week.
That's what you theenk.
Nice.  But right out of our brochure.
Yeah, but what would happen if that little mirror came out of the crystal.
When the Mayflowers find out we have the Codex, they're going to want to make a deal...
Ah, the mafia, the cops; do I know how to party or what?
The only thing you can't do is get sex for free.  I know I was in prison for like basically the 80's, but, call me daffy, aren't you supposed to <u>stop</u> me from committing crimes.  You know, Book-em-Dano, Call-for-backup, Give-a-Hoot-Don't-Pollute.
Yes.
So when's that Sebastian-Cabot- Buckingham-Palace-looking- Butlerhead getting here?
It'll take a couple of years of steady production, but I'll flood the market with so much gold that gold itself, the foundation of all finance, will lose its meaning. Brokers, economists, and fellow entrepreneurs will drown in the saliva of their own nervous breakdowns.  Markets will crash- crash.  Financial Empires will crumble-crumble.
Good news, bud, the Mayflowers have moved up the time-table. You're hitting the Vatican to-night.
Yeah, right.  By the way, as long as I'm getting things off my chest, I'm the one who killed your little monkey.  Made it look like a Mafia hit.  Did it for fun. Ciao.
Sharp.
Snappy.
The Shazzammeter!
Well, that even surprised ole Moses at fust. I didn't think the Board was that smart.
Adenoids?
Ten dollars? Let's grab a highball!
But, Al, it's the bunk! Norville showed me his design for the whatsit the day I met him! Why Buzz couldn't have invented it -- look at the man -- he's an imbecile!
Oh, Buzz is pretty harmless, really --
Mind if I join you?
Well, I just don't know how to thank you, Mr. Barnes --
...Why don't I just type this up...
Oh no, Amy, pardon me for saying so but I find that very farfetched.
Never mind about that...
You're awful kind to yourself, Norville Barnes -- the fact is you've slowed down, sitting up here like a sultan, not doing a lick of work! Why you know it's ideas that are the lifeblood of industry and you haven't come up with one since the hoop and the reason's plain to see! You've forgotten what made your ideas exciting for you in the first place -- it wasn't for the fame and the wealth and the mindless adulation of -- would you get out of here?!
Now, Aim --
Aww, what's the difference. I'm all washed up... When you're dead, ya stay dead... Hey, fella!
As a three-dollar bill.
It's pure speculation! Why, they'd have my butt in a satchel!
I've got an even hotter story -- The Sap from the City Desk.
Watch it, Archer --
It's about a dimwitted editor who --
What kind of bar is it if ya can't get a martini?!
Forty-fourth floor, and it's very --
Waring Hudsucker! Na-ha-ha-ha-ha! Say, buddy!
But, buddy --
Sure, Mr. Muss -- uh, Sid said I could have the job back.
But, Buzz, you know I never --
And Sid says you stole it!
Geez, I --
No, sir.
Not even behind your back?
Sir! They voted me most likely to succeed!
Oh my God, sir!
Damnit, where's my car!
She's looking for her mark.
The mark notices.
Hello, Niagara.
She was very sick and then she went mindless, Miss.
I do my best.  Every day I dress her just as beautifully as if she was well.  It's just like dressing a great, big doll.
Alive?
No, miss.  He's just as he was in the beginning -- on the front part of an enormous boat.
I'm afraid so.
Use your influence with Paul.  Ask him to take that whiskey decanter off the dinner table.
Wait. Don't draw any conclusions. Let me explain.
You must, Betsy. They'll have to believe you.
The West Indies?
But it's so far away...
Mr. Holland?
Ah, yes, our Paul, strong and silent and very sad -- quite the Byronic character. Perhaps I ought to cultivate it.
That doesn't sound like him.
I don't know.  I once asked Dr. Maxwell the same question.  He said he thought she was like a sleepwalker who would never waken.
A woman crying?  No one's been crying here.
A figure of St. Sebastian.
That's hard to believe, after what happened last night.
If I were as timid as you seem to think, Mr. Holland, I wouldn't have gone into the tower in the first place.
Why should you be?  My wife is a mental case.  Please keep that in mind, Miss Connell -- particularly when some of the foolish people of this island start talking to you about Zombies.
But for Wes -- it must be a temptation to him.
Didn't I?  I don't know.  That's the simple truth of it.  I don't know.
Because you wanted to give my wife back to me?  Why should that mean anything to you?
You can't believe that.  You don't know what viciousness it would take to drive a person mad.  You're not vicious or cruel, Paul.
Don't, Paul -- don't doubt yourself -- don't make me doubt you.
Yes, I said it, and I made myself believe it. But when I got here, Jessica was already raging with fever.
You admit that it is terribly dangerous. Why do you advise it?
In other words, I'm on trial.
Emotion tricks all of us, Mrs. Rand.  And you are a woman with a very strong conscience.  That conscience has been tormenting you. The rest is coincidence.  There is no such thing as a Zombie.  The dead do not come back to life. Death is final.
No.  You're quite wrong.  Right here's the seat of the trouble. Mrs. Holland has become an object of speculation and religious interest to these people.  It's revived all their old superstitions -- Zombies -- and that sort of nonsense.
Ben you know that's your territory - and I wouldn't dream to trespass - you're the expert. Hey, how do you think Paramount's gonna do with that Blatty novel, what's it called? The Exorcist?
Brilliant. Hey, you heading out a little early today?
I've been thinking, Ben, about Wendy. I was going to ask if she'd come with me sometime to meet Dr. Woolens.
It's you Ben who needs to talk. I've had my say, and I'm waiting to hear back from you.
Elena.
You go dry off now.
Up to you. I'd like to go early and leave pretty soon after that.
Oh right. The mustache coffee cup. The one that was sitting on the dash.
See for yourself.
I'm not surprised.
I know, I know. I had no idea --
I'm not.
Ben, I've got a ride home. Maybe you should sleep this one off on the couch here?
Paul? Yeah. You think --
Well it's good to see you -- we miss you around the house and all, but this St. Peter's, it's top of the line, eh?
Yeah.
After the Thanksgiving I had, I need it. You having one?
Yeah, but, I -- I've been working a lot lately, and -- No, that's not it. I guess we've just been on the verge of saying something, whatever it is, just saying something to each other. On the verge.
What are you talking about?
Who else would I be talking to? And take that thing off!
I'm not interested in your smart ass remarks now, lady. Let's go. Right now. You and I can discuss it on the walk home.
Oh for crying out loud Ben, you don't mean to tell me that your marriage is going down the drain now --
Well, Elena and I have kind of been talking, not really talking, but --
But I -- well maybe I love her. Elena.
You're not a psycho!
I don't really need to practice. I just play a few notes, you know, so I thought maybe I'd stay in.
Well I of course flatter myself that our church is not exactly what most people would call organized religion -- at times it's the disorganization that's liberating -- and of course I've begun to minister much more in what one might call therapeutic environments, in small groups, and one on one, couples --
The water, as you call it, is a special mixture of amaretto and Ben&Ben blended for just the exact chemical interaction with the last of our precious Thai stick.
I gotta get to English class.
Flame on, asshole.
Do what?
What do you mean?
My man, I speak to you solely as a comrade in arms offering unconditional aid. I've been giving this one a lot of thought, and I believe that the two of you together might just reach that higher ground that --
Francis. You gonna leave the seeds in there? In the binding like that?
All will be revealed, baby.
Howdy there. You, young knight. Can you check on the mead? Can you sally forth and secure us some more mead?
Hell, I guess he takes after me, huh?
My what?
That's good, because I don't think Libbets is capable of the sex act.
Tell Sandy? What?
Huh?
What time is it?
I'm, uh, in the midst of a moral dilemma. And I was wondering, because I know you're a very moral person, and --
What are you doing?
Don't worry about them. They're at that party, getting drunk and falling all over each other and making jokes about McGovern and stuff.
I don't remember.
About an hour ago.  Said he was more than happy to cooperate.
I know.
Why?
I wish I'd had the chance to get to know him better.  Take him fishing or something.
No.
She'd come to me, sometimes in the middle of the night.  Bruises all over her back, her upper arms.  I pled with her to let me call the police, but she wouldn't hear it.  Wanted to keep it a secret.
You know what about.
One word to I.A. and he walks.
No.  He didn't say what his name was. Only that you were expecting him.
That's not what he thinks.
What did he look like?
There's a guy down the hall.  Complaining about the noise.  Says he can't sleep.
We're under investigation now.  Back in Seattle.  Hap wanted to talk.  As soon as we got back.  Thought he could work out some kind of deal.
Huh?
But she was seeing someone else on the side.
What kind of stuff?
The other guy?
You don't know.
Good to see you, too, Randy.
Since grade school.
You don't know.
She wouldn't tell me!
Who?
If you want it to be...
Surely you know the one who made you...
But the one who made him, who made the one who made him, the source of all this evil...
Perhaps...
I have not spoken to him...
Yes I knew him. Knew him well enough not to mourn his passing.
Follow me - that way - through my cell -
What a pair we are. We deserve each other, don't we?
Don't mock me, Louis. Help me.
I can't. Go away from me.
Yes...
I've come to answer your prayers. You want to die, don't you? Life has no meaning anymore, does it?
Vampires. We thrive on blood.
I want it!
You have fed. You were made for this...
And if I don't?
The sun will destroy the blood I've given you. Every tissue, every vein. The fire in this lantern could do that too.
Anything is possible. But just try it for a week. Come into New Orleans and let me show you some real sport!
Tell me about him. You must have lernt something from him! It had to happen for you as it did for me!
That and more.
Don't worry, Louis, you're conscience is clear. You left her alive.
Yes. I remember...
So much the better. I've got a pocket full of tapes.
Why should I lie? 1791 was the year it happened. I was twenty-four - younger than you are now.
But times were different then. I was a man at that age. The master of a large plantation just south of New Orleans...
You need a new passion, Louis, a new reason to feel... what a story you've told, you don't understand yourself.
Not possible, I'm afraid. The last ferry left hours ago. And we got a storm coming. There won't be another one for days.
I should go up there. I should call her back, tell her I'm coming.
No.
What are you doing in my closet?
Yet. Nothing yet.
Then, don't.
Hey, sorry...  He's my friend, too. And that ticket is not going to waste.
The dockhand guy. Hanging by his neck from up there.
Hey, slow down, turn off the little motor up in there...What do you say we go to the gym and work off a little stress?
I'll be givin' your fisherman some of that and see how he likes it.
They never found the body.
Then, we fight --
Every guy in history who tried to pick up a girl did the good-friend thing first.
Why are you being like this?
This weekend?
I'm trying. I really am...Sometimes I don't even know why I came up here in the first place.
To get out of Southport?
Right. Planes get hit by lightning. They get hit by meteors. They hit other planes.
It's...him.
What do you mean, Julie?
It's my fault. I shouldn't have...I didn't think...
Are you sure? I really appreciate it.
Come on, I'll take a break and we'll all dance.
Where there's a Will, there's a way. Come on.
Yes!
Crowded.
I'll go find him.
Why don't you stay here tonight? Get a good sleep. You can return to your command in the morning.
I must meet him with laughter - with songs and laughter -- to show him I am not afraid --
They were gore before I came here.
No.  She shall not be left here.
No one can take my father's place.
I don't know now without my father.
I do not know him, but I have seen him.
She is dead — at peace.
It was, the plague
Your father loved me.  He wanted to marry me. But he was afraid of hurting the gentle, delicate Cathy. You spoiled his life ——you've ruined mine ——
What if he is?
Wouldn't I?
Why -- no not before Thea came ——
Oh, now —— now look here ——
Not Theodosia. Theodosia's daughter -- your daughter.
Why in the world can't you?
He hates all my race.
Who?
Merry Christmas.
Well, I guess they do those things. Well, I trust you had a good year.
Well, you look about like the kind of an angel I'd get. Sort of a fallen angel, aren't you? What happened to your wings?
You'll see a lot of strange things from now on.
Oh, yeah. Hey, little fellow –– you worry me. You got someplace to sleep?
Don't you understand, George? It's because you were not born.
Then if I wasn't born, who am I?
Sit down? What are . . .
Oh, I forgot. You haven't got your wings yet. Now look, I'll help you out. Concentrate. Begin to see something?
That's him when he was twelve, back in 1919. Something happens here you'll have to remember later on.
That's the kid.
Yes, but what happened to George?
No!
No, worse. He's discouraged. At exactly ten-forty-five PM tonight, Earth time, that man will be thinking seriously of throwing away God's greatest gift.
You will spend that hour getting acquainted with George Bailey.
The Building and what?
It was his faith and devotion that are responsible for this organization.
Well, this house ain't been lived in for twenty years.
That's why I came to see you, sir. It's that clock-maker's turn again.
Mother? What do you want?
Yeah, all right. Now, I'll paste this together.
Yeah –– old Joe College Wainwright, they call me. Well, freshman, looks like you're going to make it after all.
Hee-haw!
I'm not rubbing it in. Well, I guess we better run along.
Hmmmm . . .
Nice girl, Mary.
Hmmm . . .
Yes, sir.
No.
Oh, he's a sick man. Frustrated and sick. Sick in his mind, sick in his soul, if he has one. Hates everybody that has anything that he can't have. Hates us mostly, I guess.
Couldn't want a better death. Lots of pretty girls, and we're going to use that new floor of yours tonight, too.
Come on, George, let's hurry.
Then we can go up to the falls. It's beautiful up there in the moonlight, and there's a green pool up there, and we can swim in it. Then we can climb Mt. Bedford, and smell the pines, and watch the sunrise against the peaks, and . . . we'll stay up there the whole night, and everybody'll be talking and there'll be a terrific scandal . . .
Now, let's hear from you . . .
Well, how do you do. Congratulations. Congratulations. What am I doing?
All right now, what happened? How did it start?
All of it?
I'm not interested in your book. I'm talking about the Building and Loan.
Yeah, so I noticed. Have you made up your mind?
Thank you.
Mary . . .
You didn't even have a honeymoon. I promised you . . .  . . . Your what?
Well, then . . it's usually customary to bring the money with you.
Well, I don't know....
I think we're changing course a little.
No.
Good.  It's terrible.
Yeah.
Then why are we futzing around the dock?  We can make a few bucks working at the beach.
I could give you a dozen good reasons.
Want to swim home?
The rope!  The rope!
I need a hand here....
Aren't you off-duty?
Rich people.  Home port is Newport, Rhode Island.
If I had a $100,000 boat, I sure as hell wouldn't leave it anchored alone in the channel.
Oh.
That one -- from the wreck.  You brought it up, did you look inside it?
Every day?
Because.
Sorry, I'm all booked up...  Come, m'dear.
Heck of a way to treat a taxpayer.  Don't you have any pull with the chief, here?
You don't make enough.
The what?
Is there one in these waters?
What makes you think there might be?
So there's one around here.
I can see that. Don't you know this is a big deal?
Mrs. Silvera.
For me?
That's what I said.  Is there any of that hand cleaner stuff?
Use the little brush there.  Why were you at Santos'?
Oh.  Want to talk about it?
That's great.
Sean's asleep.
What'd I say?
They have no right to treat you like that.  You've given them every- thing.  For four years, you've protected this town, the people on this island....
Very impressive ceremony.  Good speech.
And I stood by while you told the people from Ramada and Marriott that if they put up a hotel they'd need $800,000 worth of steel net around their beaches!  In New England? We all lost on that one.
Martin, when we build up our tax base a little, you can have every- thing you want; right now, the town's broke.
Go ahead, whatever it's worth.
That's it?
Brody?  This is Patrol Base.
Oh, yeah.  So why aren't they doing it now?
Great.
You're crazy.  She's Ed's girl friend.
Gaff rigged?  Why not a staysail schooner?  Go anywhere.  Look at this -- the Mayan, an Alden schooner.
What's that mean?
Give me back my hat!
And second?
Untangle it and let's go -- We don't need a blackout on the island.
Now you're talking.  Let's get out of here before we do find something.
I'll be right there.  Wait up.
That's not it.  My dad told me not to go.
You going with Patrick?
Coming about, then.
You eat Cheerios.  I want Fruit Loops.
I know, but you're just going to have to find another way.  So you better start.
I guess.
Yeah.
My imagination isn't that good.
Everything's going wrong.  I'm having more trouble with Bobby than I ever have before.  I can't get him to respond.
No.
Let's not talk about that now, okay?
Swim where?  Out there?  Oh, no, forget it, not me!  You go, I'm staying.
Yeah, and so will I be if I start swimming in that blackass jungle.
No, I don't want to leave now. I'm having too good a time... Of course I'm coming!  You'd think you're gonna leave me?
It's all right, baby.  We're safe...
God, they're horrible.  I hate them.  Did you see its eyes?  How black they are?  The look in them?
It's never over...  Here comes another six years of bad dreams.
I got it on sale.  A real steel.
What's that?
How's your patient?
Recovering nicely.
Okay.
I have to get out of here.
I don't understand.
That's why they're always moving. They have to have it.
No, no.  That won't do.
Well, I have to get this into the networks.  If you can't do it, you can't do it, that's all.
That's a load of codswopple.  A Great White doesn't fear man.  It doesn't fear beast.  It's an orgy of food and blood.
It's one of the world's greatest creatures.
A shark could have a hundred embryos in its sack.  You know how many are born?  Maybe five. They eat each other before birth! They're born killers!
So do I, love.
What in hell is that?
We're taking that shark alive!
Sure.
Better than catching Sean's herpes.
Are you really?
The one that goes underwater?
I'm not acting!  I don't want to go in it, okay?
SEAN!
Now what?
What?
Well, we're not going to hurt it, old boy.  I say, love, is Flipper ready to go?
Damn!  You sonuvabitch!  Look at you!
Sharks???
He needs a haircut.
No, really.  I've never met anyone like her before.  This is it.
Not today.  Come on, Thea....
Then don't come any closer.
I'm not on vacation....
I'd be afraid of losing....
Mommy lets me....
You were a monkey....
Children are never satisfied.  I have my house, my friends, my job...My life, Michael.  I have to live it. Besides, I'll be back.  Now show your mother what a good dancer you are.
There's nothing to worry about....
There's a lot...I want to talk about it....
When it killed Sean it was like a stab in the heart.  I knew with absolute certainty that it had come for him. I knew that.  I know it's coming....
Boss' day off...Take the wheel....
No one does till they learn....
If you don't take it, we'll be swimming in a minute.
You're impossible....
They took me to the chief, who took a long look at me, then took me in his hut....
There are...I'm tired of one-way conversations....
The whole idea is preposterous....
I stuck them on, man....
Put me down, damnit....
You're afraid of the competition out there....
Stop busting my hump....
We don't write up anything until we're done....
The shark will get it for us.
As long as he's been here....
How long has he been here...?
He gambles...He likes a good time...I see him around....
Nothing.. But stay within a quarter mile...I've got a three-mile radius on the monitor.  If he comes back I'll hear him.  You'll have time to get up.
I don't like it....
What about the monitor...?  You getting anything on the shark?
'Snuck up on me....'
I've got to get to her....
It's my fault...I have to....
Here comes the cow ca-ca....
Now wait a minute... I'm being serious here....
We're out of decaf...We're out of petty cash...And we're out of requisition forms....
What? Whatta you mean, no? Who is -- who is telling you? Whatta you mean, no? Yes, you'll wear pink or else. Or else you'll wear pink.  And, darlin', oh, I'm gonna take you to Coney Island.
I'm afraid it's the "van" again.
Only me and Mom ..
We only got one .. He doesn't drive.
What d'you mean, I just opened it for you? This is <u>French</u> champagne.
O.K.
Find yourself a farmer's daughter with nice big fucking tits, and shake that "bye-bye." Send it to Sacramento, John .. I sniff grief ..
Thank Christ we got a witness.
So am I. But where's my money?
Pay me, and I shut up.
Why?
It's not your friend. It keeps you sucking. Remem- ber the old Bum's lungs?
I wanna take that fucking Blind In- stitute to pieces .. Every address book, every phone call, everyone in and outta there in the last 5 years ..
No .. You didn't know that ..
<u>I'm sick of this toy town shit</u>.
Screw Citrine. He can fire me.
I guess by the bed.
What is all this Jennifer stuff?
And did they?
You ain't talking to no one, till you calm down.
Fucken noddle's hanging off ..
How come he's suddenly so forth- coming? I'd like to kick him right in the ass. If he'd discussed it with me, I mighta gotten somewhere ..
Wrong cabinet.
Don't lie, Taylor. I just had this Blattis guy on the phone asking me for a comment - you gave him the whole damned case!
Then you could have saved yourself a lot of driving, Sergeant. What I said on the phone's the same as I'm saying now. I got no idea where Amb- er is, or who it was took her there.
Well, apparently, she saw Amber the weekend she left, & was briefly in the room with the guy she left with.
Of course I would ..
Oh.
Pray?
I was married to her sister ..
He said you're quite chubby. And you have a nervous tick.
It's not possible right now.
Don't mix very well with beer.
Even better.
Jerry, this is what intimacy is!
I know about the bachelor party.
And the egyptian cotton shirt that works with or without the jacket.  Tell me again, how was it left with Cush?
You are not a loser.
You lost your head, it happens.  I'm so fuckin jazzed!  Listen. I'm going to have to fly to Chicago tomorrow, how 'bout if we meet in the Dallas airport and we all fly into New York together for the draft?
Oh honey.  It's spun.
It's over --
Listen to me, it's over.
I'm not trying to make history. _ 67.
Okay. San Diego just came in with a last-minute scenario.  It's big.
Oh come on --
This is fuckin Michael Jordan, man! They should be screaming.
My favorite aunt is hearing impaired. He said "you complete me." _ 40.
Sorry, that's my son and the nanny. I had the calls transferred to my home so I could go over your stuff.
I just got goosebumps.
I'm glad you're home.  That "alone" thing is... not my specialty...
Sure --
Good evening.
Yeah, what happened there.
Oh good.
Exactly because I know this is a time when you need to be alone with your thoughts.  _ 86.
Bye you guys. _ 88.
What?
Good night.
No.  I have to go in.  I live here.
No no.  Don't do that.  Don't say that if you don't...
I don't know --
Dorothy -- what if I'm just not built that way?
Of course I know --
Please, if I start talking --
And I love my fans, of which he is one. Wanna thank them for all my Sundays, and of course my Monday nights too.  That about says it...
Why the fuck am I here?  I feel like I'm five years late for the Prom.
Let's do it again.
The least you could do is nod and act sympathetic --
Yeah, man, it means love, respect, community... and the dollars too. The package.  The kwan.
Great word.  Towel?
How do I know?
No.  A real man does not shoplift the "pooty" from a single mom.
Hey, that's my word, okay?
What's that supposed to mean?
For loyalty, you buy a dog.  For love, you get married.
Well, friends can tell each other anything, right? If we have our "friends" hats on --
Airight.  Here's why you don't have your ten million dollars yet. You are a paycheck player.  You play with your head.  Not your heart.  In your personal life?  Heart. But when you get on the field --  _ 113.
A year-and-a-half later, we were both in Hawaii for the Pro Bowl. Now I've always hit a wall at 18 months.  Every serious girlfriend lasts 18 months.  It's like --ka- boom.  The curse of 18 months.
That's when you need to cement, and define define define.
Alright, I'm freaking too.  But they need you to stay calm.  I'll call back. _ 124.
You wanted smaller.
No.
He says it's a bad idea!
We called everyone, did everything we could. Because of all the controversy over this island, no one will step in. Costa Rica says it's a no-fly zone, it's their own damn fault. Guys at the U.S Embassy -- our U.S. Embassy -- said we should "accept the inevitable." You believe that?
Oh, don't worry about that.
Just hold on.
Dr. Grant was.
Reverse-Darwinism. Survival of the most idiotic.
They never got that big.
That's because it wasn't on their list. Who knows what else they were up to?
A raptor claw. I use to have one. A fossil.
This plane can not land!
Sure you have. You wrote that book...
How do you mean?
Ajay.  Go on up to my ranch, take a look around the trophy room, and tell me what kind of quarry you think could possibly be of any interest to me.
They do have motives.  Why did you want to see me?  Your message said it was urgent.
Well?  Didn't it all seem a trifle compact to you?
No, no, no, no, no, no . . .
I don't even know this woman.
No, Dad.  I have thoughts of my own once in a while.
That Richard.
I hadn't planned on bringing carnivores back because of the liability risk, but I only thought of adults, it never occurred to me --  You are a billion dollar idea, my little f-
Piss.
Good.
Do me a favor.  Don't pretend for a second that you and I don't know the truth.  You can convince Time magazine and the Skeptical Inquirer of whatever you want, but I was there.
InGen is my livelihood, Dr. Malcolm, and I will jealously defend its interests.  People will know what I want them to know when I want them to know it.
Don't start a legal argument with me, this island isn't your property, and neither are these animals!
Don't ask me.  The guy's completely out to lunch.
No!  Get in the car before they hear us!
Look, we have two choices.  We can hike back down to the lagoon, where we can sit for two days, in the open, next to a heavily used water source while we're waiting for your boat to arrive, or we can head for the village, where we might find some shelter and we can call for help.
We'd never make it past the raptors. Trust me, I have some experience in this matter.
It'll still exit if they go on not knowing, won't it?
I'm her father.
They will come after me.  But I can collect some stool samples, for DNA with that, Nick's tapes, and the rest of you to back me up, it should stand when we get back.
Ian, they will misplace our evidence, shoot holes in our testimony, and say some special effects genius created the animals.  The only way people will ever believe that dinosaurs exist is if you dump a T-rex in the middle of times Square.
He doesn't need a friend, he needs a shrink.
Well, Nedry said a few systems would go off-line, didn't he?
Uh - - about two million.
Two million - - great.  That would help.  Oh good, that'll take no time.
Mr Nedry, Mr Nedry.  The embryos have to be back here in San Jose by then.
Six weeks?
There's only one way to be positive.  I need to see some droppings.  I have to see the dinosaur's droppings.
I'm sorry for the dramatic entrance, but I'm in a hurry. Will you have a wee bit of a drink now and then?
Come along.  I know my way around a kitchen.  Come along.
Oh my God.
You're absolutely right.  Yes, you're right.  Hiring Nedry was a mistake, that's obvious.  	We're over- dependent on automation, I can see that now.  But that's all correctable for the next time around.
If they died together, they lived together. Suggests some kind of social order.
Cheap, cheap, cheap.
It's my favorite.
Yeah, I know.
- - totally incidental  unrelated to the feeding pattern - -
What's that?
I can see the shed from here!  We can make it if we run!
It's anti-nature.
Anti-nature.
It changed.  Why?  Okay, back over your wrist.  Because and here is the principle of tiny variations - - the orientations of the hairs - -
Alan, listen to this.
He had to leave early to be with his daughter.  She's getting a divorce.
Are they heavy?
Relax Donald, relax.  They're scientists.  They ought to be curious.
Tim.
Triceratops was a constant browser, and constant browsers would be constantly sick.
Tim, I'll come back for you.  I'll get Lex out first.
What if the car falls?  What if the wheels fall?
It's good protein.  Come on, Lex.  Why don't you touch it?  Look at his nose.
You're crazy!  I'm not gonna jump!
Yeah, they hate me.
I know.
We gotta do something.
I, uh, don't really know any.  We - -
Well, I'm afraid I do.  There's one, a particular pebble in my shoe.  He represents my investors.  He says they insist on outside opinions.
It's safe.
Well, on the tour - - the film said they used frog DNA to fill in the gene sequence gaps.  They mutated the dinosaur's genetic code and blended it with that of frogs.  Now, some West African frogs have been known to spontaneously change sex from male to female, in a single sex environment.  Malcolm was right!  Look, life found a way!
Timmy!  Do as he says!  Timmy!  Do as Dr. Grant says, quick!
It's am easy catch, you let - - go - - you do the counting, you count it, Tim.  One, two, three -- you do all the counting, okay?
Hold on - - this is no species that was obliterated by deforestation or the building of a dam.  Dinosaurs had their shot.  Nature selected them for extinction.
There's nothing that great about discovery.  What's so great about discovery?  It's a violent, penetrative act that scars what it explores.  What you call discovery I call the rape of the natural world!
Turn it off, Lex!  Turn it off!
Why did you do this?
What if we fall?  I hate trees.
Shut up!  You're scaring me.  Stop!  You're scaring me.
Do you think they like the fact that tourism has dropped ninety-eight percent in the last ten years?
I don't think you're getting in the spirit of things, Janet. We'll buy whatever studies we need --
You have a map.
That's right. Wasn't on any of the maps... we could barely see it through the underbrush. Place must've been abandoned for twenty years.
It's all right.  Now... we're going to need a really good head-doctor for this. Someone who can get up on the stand and tell the jury that our client is mentally insane and has been for years...  We'll go through a dozen doctors before we find one who's willing to testify for us.
Insomnia. Not unusual for someone in his situation.  Not to mention he's a bed-wetter.
Well, Jason _was_ in a canoe accident in 1967 and presumed drowned. His mother died a few years later after a long bout with cancer. Some time in the early eighties, there were a string of murders out by Crystal Lake...  People started saying it was Jason... back from the dead.
The mother said the boy hadn't slept for over three _months_. A physical examination showed dilated pupils, temperature of one-oh-two, blood chemistry highly imbalanced...
Well, I'm onto something more useful.  You ever hear of a man named Fred Krueger?
That's right. The murders in the eighties were never solved.  But... there were teenaged witnesses who said Krueger had the ability to appear in your dreams... and that if he killed you in a dream, it would kill you in the real world.
Think it'll do any good?
_Neurolar_. It's a stimulant -- it's also a serotonin inhibitor. It suppresses all electrical activity in the hippocampus... the part of the brain that controls dreaming.
You have been hearing the sordid side then.
You were his friend.  One link is all they need.
-- In magazines nobody reads.
Did you?
A cenotaph -- a monument to someone whose remains ended up elsewhere. But look --
It's my last and final one.
I usually take lunch by the River.
Attitude, Kafka.  It doesn't matter how well you do your work -- you still see it as something to be gotten on with rather than something to take an active interest in.
Sorry, yes -- well -- thank you, sir.
Why would you suppose so?
No.
He wasn't robbed.  He was identified by his wallet.
I have no right to be, I know.  My experience with real life  is practically nil.
When you only see someone sitting at a desk all day, it's liable to create a false impression.
They're not obliged to tell.
Now Burgel's one of the authorities?
I knew you walked this way to work.  I wanted to find you before they did.
There's a new potion -- he said it was perfected.
Engaged in the manufacture and distribution of ... pills and so forth.
We know that.
We saw her naked once -- didn't we.
Then why haven't I been --
A mere slip.  Your friend Mr. Raban dealt only with claims that came <u>in</u>, another department being responsible for compensation that goes out -- this is correct?
It only amuses me in that it gives me an insight into the ludicrous bungling that in some circumstances may decide the life of a human being.
I had the grandest of financial plots in mind, the most malevolent of personal motives, conspiracy theories extending to every ... authority I could see.  And I find you.  A body snatcher.
Why would we keep files on <u>dead</u> employees?  All old files are sent up to the Castle.  Do you think we have room for two hundred years worth personnel records?
I did read that.  They gave him a posthumous medal.
Is your friend's name among them?  Then he only worked on the one case.  Your Chief will send me the final summation when he's finished with it.
We used to be in the supply section, carrying boxes of medicine about but we dropped too many of them.
And we're upset too.
Look Mr Denham - you're not welcome here. Just pack up your cameras and go.
It's ... lovely.
All in due course, Ann. Our first responsibility is to get these artifacts safely back to London.
But . . . we can' t Jack, I need time to collect artifacts ... make sketches ... gather evidential information.
We need those co-ordinates -someone's gotta get back there and jot the rest of it down
The mountains?
Nab- Let's get it over with.
Coz of something I lost.
She was with you after she left Frank.
Well it's more than loneliness. Hate. People hating me -- and watching me and following and waiting to hurt me -- you know? I'm all screwed up.
You think people hate you.
Now there's a picture I'd like you to --
Grunemann? I've looked at him a --
Then it doesn't matter what I do any more, does it?
Gee.
Dew yew hayuv ah-dentifikyshun?
All right, yes, I had been. Those sick, wild letters -- I'm watching you, gonna follow you, gonna punish you, kill you et cetera. Well, they said, all right that's Grunemann. So try to remember when you and he - when -- well I don't know, there was that dumper once, he sounded like that dumper --  Dumpers; they get their kicks beating you up. A man hired me once, then tried to really kill me - that'd be about two years ago.
What about the other things you've reported? --  -- being followed on the --
OK.
What do I do meanwhile? -- wait for that clown to fall through the skylight on me?
Oh -- wait -- oh I get it. You said that just to keep me scared. So I'd tell you everything I -- oh clever; oh you smart, tricky hick.
Oh. No. Not that way. I'd say it was more -- I don't know --  -- too bad? Pathetic?
Goodbye.
Arlyn had a very big habit - heroin - she's the one who started Frank. She's strung out now; you won't find her.
The same as Jane McKenna.
What if i go out on tricks - you wanna come along? You could sit and read the National Geographic.
No, you can find some other way.  Explain it to me. Bree, show me any sense to --
You get the Christ out! You dumb stupid bastard, you don't know anything, you square, you get out! I don't have to show you anything; you get out!
My bed.
Is that all you have to say?
You're going back?
You could at least look at me!
About what?
OK.
It's where it doesn't get me. I've got nothing left that connects to anything.
Then, close the case.
Well as a matter of --
I've been up country, you know my summer place, my camp. I don't even have a telephone there. This morning they sent a messenger out, that you'd been trying to call me.
You were hired to look for Tom.
No, I'd -- like to be in on it.
Tomorrow. See you tomorrow night.
I know Tom Grunemann.
We grew up together. Kids.
I left them here. I was doing some work here.
Inspector we understand your position; ours is a little different. We have an investment in Tom Grunemann. The Company has an investment, and we feel entitled to investigate for ourselves.
Mr. Streiger, speaking frankly -- we've appreciated the Sergeant's interest you know, all along. Here, locally. But New York, that's - well --
Not particularly.
My daddy doesn't hit me, silly. Why would my daddy hit me?
Show...
The little hand is on the six and the big hand is on the nine. Where is mommy?
No.  If I'm not here, you go home with Thelma and Kim.
That's terrific.  That's really terrific, but I notice I'm the one that's cleaning up this--  Oh, crap, I'll have to do this one over.
You don't hate it.  We had Salisbury steak last week and you liked it fine.
I don't care.  I hate it.  I want pizza.
Dad?
Wow!  That's neat.   Can I sit in it?
Bigger than a principal.  The judge sits in robes in a big chair.. The judge has thought a lot about us, about you and me and your mom, and he has decided...  ...he has decided that it would be best for you to live with your mom Joanna in her apartment.  And I'm very lucky.  Because even though you'll live with your mom Joanna I'll get to see you once a week for dinner and a couple of weekends a month.
At your mom's.  She'll have a bed for you in your own room.
Sustained.
I see.  Well, you'll have to do better than that.  Do you have any affidavits to support negligence?
Yes...
It was good.  He was a hard worker, a lot of drive, a real hustler.
Mr. Kramer, nobody even thinks about leaving their job until after they get their Christmas bonus.
Look, you don't understand.  I need a job.  I've got a kid and--
In all that time did your husband ever strike you or abuse you physically in any way.
We were married two years before the baby.  And then four very difficult years.
I consider it less my failure than his.
I heard you, Joanna.  I promise I heard you.
I'm not taking him with me.
NO!...Please...Please don't make me stay...I swear...If you do, sooner or later...maybe tomorrow, maybe next week...maybe a year from now...  I'll go right out the window.
So do you.
Ted, if you can't discuss this rationally--
Joanna, go fuck yourself!
Well, ah...I thought it over and I decided we're doing it Murray's way.
Sure.
No.  No, I don't believe it. Jim O'Connor would never let anything like that happen.  He gave me my shot in this business. If it wasn't for Jim O'Connor I'd be--I don't know where I'd be. He's a wonderful man...
Kramer--
I've been offered a job in Washington with H.E.W.
Mr. Lombardo from packaging wants to meet on Friday.
Charley, my husband, and I are ...divorced and Kim, that's our daughter is about Billy's age and the children play together a lot.  So, I guess we see each three or four times a week.
How the hell are you going to do that?
I walk in the house and before I can say "How are you?", "Did you have a nice day?" before I can say anything.   Pow she's out the door.
Sure.
No.
Are you, General?
Chairman Mao can keep China. Just give us back Tibet.
General Chiang.
I have.
All?
With much bloodshed.
Not yet, but the Governor of Chamdo, Ngabo Jigme, suggests we must negotiate and offers to go to Peking.
I pooped.
No. Not very big.
Where is Alsace?
I do not know, Holiness.
You are the man who wrote this letter. You are the man who has come back to lead us. You will soon have great responsibilities. You must know what to do.
Eight thousand, five hundred, soldiers and officers. We have recently requested mortars, anti-aircraft guns and ammunition from India. We have several hundred in the area.
Shall we consult the protective deities, Holiness?
My first and foremost duty is to protect my people. I feel sure of this. And, things change. Maybe not right away, maybe not soon. But I believe this -- things will change.
The Communists put their guns in the hands of the Khamba children and force the child to kill the parent. They have dropped bombs on the monastery of Lithang in Kham. It has been destroyed. Women and children, trying to escape from the fighting, have been shot with machine guns, fired from airplanes.
The people will not allow it.
Thank you.
I leave tomorrow.
Always.
Is he a bad man? Norbu says he is "lavish" and "willful". "How can he give you monk's vows if he has not kept them himself?"
He was always nice to me. He found me. He saw me in his dreams.
You decide.
And after the game, we're going to trade. You just stay over there, no, there!, Norbu, and I will shoot at you. I want your land. I take it. I am stronger.
Is that true or pretend?
I do.
You are unharmed?
Completely.
Too young?
Thank you.
I need to see his habitat.
Jesus.  About twelve more yards.  Keep coming just like that.
I'll need any and all topographic studies.
I coulda shot you, you--
Whenever somebody dies I consider it such a waste that I didn't know him better.
You ready on shore?
Nothing's real.
Oh, bullshit.
No.
We lure him on land and pump him with the drugs.
And even if they <u>did</u>, I doubt <u>he</u> or <u>she</u> would have problems with <u>tents</u>.
Adult males will charge hatchlings. If there's one out there...
I beg your pardon?
That's probably good.
Excuse me?
Let's get away from the shore.
Night.
I'm not mushing it.
<u>Calm</u> <u>down</u>.
Alright, Jack!
Well...
He's floating.  Take it home.
You wouldn't?
No, I actually <u>want</u> to stay for a little while.
Alright, Ms. Paleontologist.  I wanna know why that monster is here.  You got a theory?
They won't be here till at least noon.  We got a few hours to kill.
Hector.  <u>Do</u> <u>not</u> <u>move</u>.
And you didn't see <u>anything</u>?
What kind of backup do we have?
Sorry.  I'm just a little unclear as to why the Museum of Natural History would send somebody here.
<u>What</u>?  I don't even <u>know</u> the guy.
This is business.  There was an accident in Maine, some guy got killed by something in a lake.  Probably a bear, but... they found a tooth.
Oh, well then I'm sure that's it, he got killed by a dinosaur, anything else?
Are you on drugs?
Well... he didn't have to tell me that part.
You and Kevin.
Why does she keep repeating the name?
Agent Mapp! Thank you!
I will... I promise.
You're all right! Where is he?
A pretty young woman, to turn him on? I don't believe Lecter's ever seen a woman in eight years. And oh, are you ever his "taste" - so to speak.
The market in Lecter hints is way down, today, okay? I've got two good men dead in Memphis, and three civilians. I've got -
Good idea.
Okay, Mr. Yow...
Just briefly. What's the problem, Officer?
I hope so. They haven't posted anything.
A job's come up and I thought about you. Not really a job, more of - an interesting errand. Walk me to my car, Starling.
Not yet.
Like I have a "knack" for Dr. Lecter?
I think he means it, this time. I think he'll deal.
Transfer to a new prison. With a view of trees, he said, or even water... Can we swing that?
She doesn't know what we're up to. And we can't afford to let her find out.
Starling, we know who he is! And where he is. We're on our way now.
Ever get out for cheeseburgers and beer? The amusing house wine...?
I'm - still in training at the Academy.
No, no, no. You were doing fine, you'd been courteous and receptive to courtesy, you'd established trust with the embarrassing truth about Miggs, and now this ham-handed segue into your questionnaire. It won't do. It's stupid and boring.
No, I came because we need -
All flayed...?
Do you know why he's called Buffalo Bill? Tell me. The newspapers won't say.
I'll tell you if you'll look at this form.  It started as a bad joke in Kansas City Homicide. They said... this one likes to skin his humps.
No. But I will make you happy... I'll give you a chance for what you love most, Clarice Starling.
His real name is Benjamin Raspail. A former patient of mine, whose romantic attachments ran to, shall we say, the exotic...? I didn't kill him, merely tucked him away. Very much as I found him, in that ridiculous car, in his own garage, after he's missed three appointments. You'd have him under "Missing Person" - which, in poor Raspail's case, could hardly be more true.
I don't know. Next time I'll have to check.
Yes.
After your father's death, you were orphaned. What happened next?  I don't imagine the answer's on those second-rate shoes, Clarice.
Why, Clarice? Did the rancher fuck you?
No.
On what basis would they reject him?
The personality inventories would trip him up. Rorschach, Wechsler, House-Tree-Person... He wouldn't test like a real transsexual.
How very thoughtful... Or did Crawford send you here for one last wheedle - before you're both booted off the case?
I think you were telling me the truth in Baltimore - or starting to. Tell me the rest now.
But what became of your lamb?  Clarice...?
Tell me his name, Dr. Lecter.
Well, Clarice, have the lambs stopped screaming...?
You know I can't make that promise.
The Latin name comes from two rivers in Hell. Your man - he drops these girls into rivers, every time. Didn't I read that?
Yes, miss.
You knew them.
Yes. And "do not try to understand them.  That is because they are a breed apart and they make no sense..."
The Bible. Monarchy. Many wrong ideas about the government of men. My father's people already know each man is his own nation. And only he can have dominion over himself. Not kings. No man is better than any other man.
Top of this ridge. Fort and Lake George are downhill of it.
Alice?
My letter...
Cousin Eugenie, my father, but...
You know he wouldn't send me...! You misrepresented what you saw and caused this.  I, too, was at that farm. It was as he said...
What the bloody hell plan is this?
Day and a half  Where did you get... the guide?
He is Huron and nothing else.  Why would he want to murder the girl?
Of course not!  And how is it you were nearby?
Then you are one of those who would allow England to fight alone while she protects you from France?
That is the truth!
The Crown "negotiating" the terms of service?
Logistics are his guns are bigger than mine and he has more of them. They keep our heads down while his sappers make thirty yards of trench a day. His thirteen inch mortars have a two hundred yard range, so when they're close enough, they'll move them in, lob explosive rounds over our walls and pound us to dust. They look to be three hundred yards out.  Bloody murderers.  You have three days.
I understand. This is not good place to stop.  Two leagues from here. No water 'til then.  That where we stop. Better place.
For Munro children?
Yes.
That Le Renard has the power to lead his people into the light, I know well.
Their arms?
Carry them to England to your King with pride.
Granted, Monsieur.
We almost had an accident today. DeJesus' suit...
These observers were doing something. A test...I think they sank that ship on purpose to cover up their mistakes.
And?
The good doctor hasn't showed yet.
What has?
Can you fix it?
What?
Still...you did the right thing.
Well, I always heard you don't "learn" leadership, you earn it.  How did you know they'd get into the vodka?
Maybe you're more one of us than you think...sir.
Okay.
Twelve hours, no big deal.  We should know something first thing in the morning.  Don't worry.
Timex...
The weather's good, I already checked, but I'll be off in a minute.
Russian, French, Italian, Spanish, Greek, German, a little Hindu, some Serbo Croat and a smattering of Swahili...standard pre-med background...
It...almost got you.
He's tanking on us...
Two hundred meters.
Honey, the company don't give a flying fuck about "whys," they just look at the numbers and the contract says if we miss our quota they only got to pay us half-pay for the entire month.
Sorry, darling...Just thought a little humor would loosen us all up...you know?...
Probably no longer than four weeks.
I'll think of something, don't worry.
Let's have a butcher's. Jesus, there's lots of everything. We've got god knows how much of this stinking weed; we've got a shit load of cash; and we've got a . . . traffic warden.
No, I asked you to give me a refreshing drink. I wasn't expecting a fucking rainforest; you could fall in love with an orang-utan in that.
Inside, out-fuckin'-side. I don't give a shit, you get those guns because if you don't . . .
Nope.
Jesus Christ!
That's no way to answer the phone.
All right, Kenny.
Listen, I don't care who lives in there; all as I know it's got to be preferable to death by Hatchet.
Furry muff, let's go.
It is too late for you to start thinking John. It is a possibility and that is good enough for me. And after you strip the house, I want you to get every thieving slag this side of Ceylon and torture them, badly. I want to know who is responsible, otherwise I will hold you responsible.
Er well, yes we do.
What they like then?
Hit the fuckers.
Where did they get those outfits from? Haven't we got some like that, Tom?
Bacon, the fat man and myself, and it's time to make a call to Harry.
The man who decides if you can play is this man Harry, or Hatchet Harry as some including himself like to call him.
He said he thinks we have paid him, and he wants to talk about those guns . . . now.
What do you mean, me?
I need two hundred and fifty grand.
No, I'm afraid he's not. He's out at the moment.
Range? I don't want to blow the arse out of this country, granted, but I don't want anybody blowing a raspberry at me either. I want to look fucking mean.
All right, let's forget about them for the time being. What about your weed man?
Cupid stupid! That's the last time I am getting any more fruit off you Tom. Call that fresh? There was more small hairy armoured things in your fruit than there was fruit. You should open a butcher's, not a grocer's.
Well, excuse me, brother, mother or any other sucker, doesn't make any difference, they are still fucking guns, and they still fire fucking bullets!
Nick the Greek.
Hold on, give us half a chance to count it.
That's fucked it. What do we do now? No money, no weed; it's all been swapped for a pile of corpses.
I mean we grow copious amounts of ganja, and you don't look like your average hort-er-fucking-culturalist, that's what I mean, Willy.
You'll find out when I get you home. Thanks, Sam.
You think I can't learn that?
I am, sir.
What exactly do you think your job is, Private?
The--the officers.
Do whatever they tell you--
No, sir. Not at all.
Yes, sir.
I'm sorry, Sergeant Major. There wasn't anything I could do. Shadow gets crazy--
Thank you, Sergeant Major.
Business is booming. Got your drugs, got your illegals--had a shooting the other night at Big O's--Soldier got ventilated.
A .45--
You feeling bad for Jimmy? Have him tell you the size of the mordida they took out of his hide when he run a place on the other side. Those old boys in Ciudad Leon--
You're fired. You're outta the department.
You little pissant--
Rio. BUNNY Right. This kid, Hosea Brown? Does tire 40 in 3.4, soft hands, lateral movement--the whole package. Only a sophomore--
You still going to all the home games?
You watch the draft this year? 'Course you didn't, idiot question. They try to make it dramatic, like there's some big surprise who picks who in the first round? Only they been working it over with their experts and their computers for months. Doctor's reports, highlight reels, coaches' evaluations, psychological profiles--hell, I wouldn't be surprised if they collected stool samples on these boys, have 'em analyzed. All this stuff to pick a football player for your squad. Compared to that, what you know about the person you get married to don't amount to diddly, does it?
You got to be in the Army, you might as well have something slick to drive.
This place, the one across the street, four other ones around Ciudad Leon-- soy el Rey de las Llantas. King of the Tires. Lots of your people rollin' back over that bridge on my rubber.
Right.
You finding lots of cactus and shit?
You met her family? They gonna be cool about you being a white guy?
They were using M-1's, yeah--
What's it doing on a rifle range?
Seriously, I think we should get married.
You know who it was they dug up?
I've got the forensics fella coming down from the Rangers. No way to know how old the body is without some lab work.
That's where he fell.
I been hearing rumors about this new commander coming for a couple weeks now. Boys say they heard he's a real hard case. Spit-and-polish man. Full- bird colonel name of Payne, they say-- Bet you never figured you end up back here.
And people make their choice--
We was crossin' the river--
I thought you were married!
When you backed me you needed somebody named Deeds to bump the other fella out of office.  Hey, folks--
Floating around out here, playin' hell with them bass--play a little cards, play a little golf, drink some beer--
You thought any more about our murder?
Word gets out who that body was, people are gonna think Buddy done it.
People come here to catch bass and to get laid at the Boy's Town in Cuidad Leon--
I don't mean Fernando.
Mami, the first time I brought him home, those were your exact words-- "some chulo with grease under his nails."
I won't say nothing bad about the man, but you can ask away.
We run that twenty-odd years. Give it over to Otis Payne in 1967. April.
Not if I can help it.
For a while.
Three months.
I got a bad stomach. It helps me digest.
He murdered Eladio Cruz. That tough enough for you?
I remember him watching me once. When I was little--before you and I--
They've got me. Different thing.
Looks real bad if the teacher's late for class. It's really nice to talk with you, Sam.
There's nothing on the walls. No pictures--
Yeah?
Couple months before I was born--
He paid the hospital bill when you were born. Your mom always calls you "our beautiful daughter" in the letters she wrote to him.
Everything that went before, all that stuff, that history--the hell with it, right?
This is a club, Sheriff--you been in here--
Who is he?
All right.  It was...
He won't.
I could scoop them out.
I didn't have the skill to resurrect him.  I had to teach myself.  And that took time.
Yes...
You don't?
Come to the show with me. Tonight I want you to see him with an audience.  They love him.
Stuff?
Too much fame.  Yeah, I guess that'd turn anybody's head. Including yours.
He thought Nix was coming back, didn't he?
Don't be.  Nix can't hurt you now.
Find Valentin!  Find him!  Get him in here!
...yes?
Yes.
Tapert.  So, now I've got Tapert, Butterfield.
So could you walk on water?
Oh, I've got plenty.
Maybe I just bought it.
Are you a believer, then?
What for?
A ticket home,
I tried to pay you off.
I'm sorry, D'Amour...
She has no real grip on reality.
What?
He deserved it.
And she shot him I  I think that'd piss me off if I were Nix.
You don't get it, do you? We're shit. D'Amour.
Yes?
Try.
Yeah.  But not as cheap.  Call me.
No.
Well, you didn't forget me.  I just came because I wanted to know if you knew a man called Butterfield.
You don't think I've got it to give?
Why would I want to?
Liar!
Oh, hi, Elaine.
Yeah, I'll stay.
How long have you been married?
Thanks.
I'm here for the week.
Oh, good. Do you want to go to a party tonight with me and some friends who live here?
No.
I know. I don't either.
Really?
Yeah, you don't remember?
I got a fax today from your friend Hiromix.
Oh.
Where'd you grow up?
I don't know, I think maybe I broke it? I knocked into something the other day...
We should get you to the doctor.
Yeah.
Yes, but no, I can't right now.
You're a brat, wasn't there anyone else around to lavish you with attention?
Thanks.
Mr. Kazuzo sent me.
Oh?
Ok, whatever you think... I'm lost.
I don't know.
Yeah, I'll be fine. Bye.
What?
You wanna come?
That's ok.
But I like to... and I don't smoke that much.
Oh... that's nothing, someone gave it to me.
I gotta go... and I don't really like champagne.
Sure.
You know, there was a guy on the radio today trying to explain why we're losing daylight.  Quarks and dark matter, things like that.  Even how daylight savings has caught up with us over the last hundred years and our universal watch is just fast, you know?
Says she can get me in to see this killer.
When did they find her?
Thank God he did.
I don't know.  In a way, I'm glad it all happened.
I believe in you.
I thought the spare set was in the kitchen drawer.
So you're going to kill her?  Put the gun down Claire.
You really had me going, Claire.  I was finally ready to propose to you.
Frustrating.  Form over content. Everything's so retro.
And how would you describe him?
I'm gonna go make a stink.  Sit tight. I'll make sure you get a change of clothes.
You know I'm not comfortable with this.
I'm aware of that, but I don't think he's in any condition to make requests. I'm trying to appeal to your more...logical self, Father.  I'm concerned about harm to my patient.
Maya, for the last time, I will not tolerate these obsessions.
Peter.  Your life must matter to you because it matters to all of us who love you.
It was perfect.  The harder I pushed, the more you pulled away.
You are my son.  Don't you see the opportunity that lies before you?
What do you mean "don't worry?"
Would you like to rest, Miette?  You must be exhausted.
You just call?
Thank you.  Do you work in the building? You coming from the party?
Not the most popular opinion, but yes.
What if I told you I was a malignant narcissist?
I had to.
Townsend believed, just as God became man in Christ.  So Satan will assume human form.  I believe it too.
What?!?!
It's true.  Birdson knew your name, he was writing it in numerical code.  It wasn't easy but I figured it out.  It spelled your name.
If you or any of your lunatic friends ever come near me again...
There's no reason why you should.  This has been planned from your birth. You fit all the criteria that we know of.  Never baptized, born of incest, devoid of faith...
You were not baptized.  At least I don't believe it was Christian.  Your baptism was performed by your uncle, James McKenzie.
So what?
I don't know.  I do know that people who are possessed have to accept evil in some way.  I don't know if it works the same way in this instance.  I don't even know when it's going to happen.
We're going to do this.
You have to say that.
Maybe that's my problem.
Until it happens, you're still a human being.
He's been repeating that since Birdson's exorcism.  I looked in every passage in the Bible and there's nothing about an ark or a sunset that tells us anything.
Maya?  What do you mean?
I've dealt with these people before, Maya.  They're not going to help us.
Nice suit.
You're referring to the defense's efforts to prove that George Viznick is tormented by "demonic voices?"
Of course.
Mike.  Oh, the christening.  I meant to call...
Really?  You know, seeing these guys away from the court, the facade slips. You catch things.
How're you doin' today?
I don't know why I keep hoping you'll grow out of this tomboy thing.
I won't.  I'm a lesbian.
Whenever you lose, you get this attitude. But it's just a game.
How is he?
His mother had a cookout a few weeks ago. He could do a lot better if you ask me.
Child, please.  Ever since you were little you thought you were too good for anything I had to say.
Thanks, sweetheart.
What'd you do?
Until the Black family down the street became the Black family next door.
Okay?
You're a caterer?
Well, no, but once Nathan gets settled and the girls get a little older, it's definitely something I want to do.  Since you love to cook, maybe it's something we can talk about.
Really?  Well, come on, then.
It's just...it seems like you're always yelling at me.
Uh-huh.
You're just scared.  I know rehab is hard, and you have to worry about whether you'll be as good as you were but you will be.  I believe in you.  You just have to get back on the court.  Like you'd get back on a horse.
I found you someone.
I told him you looked like me.
Oh, great.
Yeah, right.
The coach from Tennessee was there and he has me riding the bench.
The coach from USC is going to be at the championship.
You were trying to make me look bad.
Just one word of advice for next season.
Just like that?
It's this big hole.  You could almost see bone.
One time Magic scored forty-eight points, and they only had six minute quarters and he sat out the whole fourth.
You're stupid.  And your Daddy plays for the worst team in the NBA.
I don't.
Hey.
He ain't Spalding.
So what dead-end street did you and Shawnee hit?
Yeah.
I don't have it easy like you, alright. There's no red carpet laid out for me.
Clothes.
I mean, I can stay a few more minutes.
You want to go talk?
What the hell's going on?
I just took the ho to Burger King, alright.
So you fucked around to prove a point!
If I stayed, I wouldn't be starting!
I never asked you to choose.
How are you going to tell me what I have time for?  I mean, whatever I did...we can fix this.
What are the doctors saying?
Wanted to give you props on making First Team All-American.  And then when Magic retired, I tried calling you again.
I'm tired of playing overseas.  Thinking about giving it a rest for awhile.
Yeah.  Basketball just, isn't fun anymore.  You know?
Yeah.  Two weeks.  I didn't get to send you an invitation, but if you...
So why'd you give up ball?
Why do you keep asking me that?
It's not fun for me anymore because you're missing.
So you're gonna bitch up?
So?
Business folks.
Uh, your earring?
Sorry.  You okay?
I'm fine.
You came out early.
A case like this could hang around for months and I'm up for this player relations job with the "Clips."  This gets out, false or not, no one'll touch me.
Lucky kid.
Your mom was real quick to show you those pictures, wasn't she? Well, she was nineteen when she got pregnant and don't get me wrong, you're the best thing in my life, but she knew I wasn't ready for no marriage.
Quincy.  I know you left school early to throw your middle finger up at me.
And now I'm paying for it, right?  That what this is about?  "I told you so?"
I can't believe you're gonna do this to me, the situation I'm in, I don't -- Avi: You know what?  Being hit by lighting doesn't matter for getting braces, ok? Now Solomon, let me just ask you once: Please. Please. Don't do this.
I'm fuckin' hammered, Burt.
no, no, c'mon Jimmy we need to call this quits and you need to see a doctor.
Jimmy you look like you're about to fuckin' die right here --
Uh-huh.
Does this sound weird?
It's rough.  I'm sorry, did she make it?
Alright, so I'm gonna transfer you over to Frank's assitant, Janet she's gonna see what she can do --
FUCK YOU.  FUCK YOU, YOU GET OUT.
GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.
Did you hear what I said?
I didn't realize it was that loud.
ok.
Yeah.
I'm a bit of a slob myself.
You take cream or sugar?
It's not -- what's a 422?
I don't wanna have to come back here in an hour and find that there's been another disturbance.
No, I'm off tonight.  I would lov-like, to go tonight, I can pick you up, I can pick you up here at about what time?  What time?
Yeah, You know it? You know Billingsley's?
Let's make a deal.
It's fine.
Yeah.
Yes I do.
just let me walk out, ok?
-- what kind?
Ready to go,go,go?
If he hadn't pissed his pants, we woulda won.  We fucking had this game.
Put the gun down, please, boy.
You don't just sign up to be a police officer -- it's about three years of training -- ok?
Sorry, little man.
Nope.  So what'd they find out in there?
Leave this one to the detectives, they ain't gonna solve shit, I can help you, make you the man with a plan, give you the gift that I flow -- think fast -- you wanna know who killed that guy?
Not yet -- "give you the clue for the bust if you show me some trust --"
Finish it up without the lip.
This sounds threatening.
Well you lost me with the last couple of cocktail words spoken, m'boy, but I believe it's that sort of love. Sounds nice to me.
Nothing special, just a spoke in the wheel.
-- and you wanna know the common element for the entire group, like he asks...I'll tell you the answer: I'll tell you, 'cause I had that question.  I had that same question....Carbon. In pencil led, it's in the form of graphite and in coal, it's all mixed up with other impurities and in the diamond it's in hard form.  "Well...all we were asking was the common element, Donnie...but thank you for all that unnecessary knowledge...ahhh, Kids!  Full of useless thoughts, eh?"  Thank you. Thank you.  And the book says: "We may be through with the past but the past is not through with us."  And NO IT'S NOT DANGEROUS TO DO THAT.
-- you don't understand: it's more pain than before and the fucking morphine pills aren't working, he's -- past two days it's like he can't really swallow them and I don't know if they're going down -- I can't see inside his mouth anymore -- I'm up all night staring at him and I don't think the pills are going down and he moans and he hurts --
Where is he?
No.
I've seen it before.
I'm looking for Frank Mackey.
Yep.
Are we gonna tape some stuff now?
You got us a room so quick?
I would just want to clear some things up:
We talked earlier about your mother. And we talked about your father and his death. And I don't want to be challenging or defeatist here, but I have to ask and I would want to clarify something -- something that I understand --
And what did your parents do?
She's my mother.
Not a problem.
They wouldn't?
no, no, no.  Certainly not.  I wasn't officialy enrolled, that's right. Was that unclear?
Uh-huh.  What's going on?
When did he go off chemo?
He's in here --?
I got a call to this apartment, report of a disturbance --
I live alone.
Maybe so, but I'm gonna ask you one more time: Is Anyone Else In This House Right Now?
Ok. What's your name?
Maybe you didn't, but I'm here to find out about a disturbance. Some neighbors called said they heard screaming and a loud crash.
I said: I DON'T KNOW.  You can't just come in here and start pokin' around --
I went out last night.
No.
It's ten o'clock in the morning --
I don't have to do a god damn thing.
I went to see her -- some fuckin' asshole answers the door in his underwear, he's fifty years old, there's coke and shit laid out on the table --
Love you too..
Yes.
Do you have any children with anyone?
Do you feel better now that you've said this?
I think that you know.
I think that she thinks I may have molested her.
...I don't know...
Saucy-saucy.
Tell him I'm sorry, ok, yes, you do that, now, I'm sorry, tell him, for all the things I've done...I fucked up and I'm sorry.... And I'm Gonna Turn Away And Walk Now And Not Look At Him Not See My Man, My Earl, I'll leave now...and tell him it's ok and I'm ok. The whole thing was ok with me -- and I know.
Do you have that?
Do you still want the peanut butter, bread and cigarettes ?
Love you too.
-- I didn't see you from the window.
..sorry...
It's raining frogs from the sky.
....what the fuck, what the fuck....
This happens....this is something that happens.
He is nothing now.
How goes that favor I asked of you?
You bring me the heart of the Jesuit General, and you will have a palace of your own.
There is that, of course -- but mainly it is because I am so much smarter than everyone else.
Do you think I have not considered that?  I have a plan -- and you may rest assured that it is brilliant!
Three days.
But -- what is he doing?
All I noticed was that Phillippe feels even more like an animal.
Still you serve him loyally -- though people hurl rotten eggs at his royal emblem.
I remember that night.  D'Artagnan was drunk, the only time I've seen him that way.  The three of us were reveling, remember, Athos?
The Queen Mother.  Anne.
Michelle, she -- The king has invited her to come live in the palace.
I have rejoined the army, and asked to resume my commission at the head of the troops of General Fromberge.
Phillippe... there is something I hope you understand.  Terrible cruelty has been used against you. And... you must understand that you did nothing to deserve it.
How did you --
A personal nature?
You dare criticize my father?!  Or lecture me?!
It shall be done, your Majesty.
Yes, your Majesty.
He is my brother.
Forgive?!
Eh?
Sometimes the poor do grow hungry. But why would they riot about it?
That food has spoiled.  That is why it was not shipped to the army.
It's lovely.  It's just...
I don't think you understand. I don't mean shuffling papers in an office, I mean Jim Trudell worked classified assignments, special forces...sabotage...until last year. He was brought up on charges of espionage, but the charges were later dropped, and he sprang the service.
That's the point.  He slipped up, and he's desperate now.  And that means he's all the more dangerous.
It happened too fast.  He was in the back, quiet and calm and boom! He was out - and gone.  We...we fanned out...Stanton must have let his guard down!
So? Girls left bars with Ted Bundy too. It doesn't rule out foul play.
I'm sure you can handle it.  Now I want to do an alley-to alley sweep beginning at the north and south ends from Marine to 30th.  Foot beat units continue on the boardwalk.
Nineteen eighty four.  What fucking difference does it make?
Did you start out area six?
That's got to our secret agent man! Do we have an address?
Yeah...the guy was psycho - I was just tying to protect the girl...
Did he harm the girl?
Well read this -
Well it's just kind of a coincidence, isn't it?  Stanton and Fleming, both started in '83, both in area six...both in Vice?
I don't know - but he's from the FBI.
I had to get away!  My life was in danger!
Look what are you anyway? Some kind of spy?
No, but I'm listening.
Where the hell is my car?
No...I'm in some trouble...
Well...whatsamatter?  Run in with the law?
It's...it's a long story.  Can we meet somewhere?
Shit, what I have now made our setup in Angola look like Tinker Toys.  I've been skipping through Internal Revenue records all day. I even have video strip poker. You want to check it out?
1490...Breckinridge...
Don't worry about me...  ...and don't forget your helmet. You don't want to get a ticket.
Well, you saved me from a bad situation. Thanks.  I admit this is...unusual.
We were fighting - I told him to let me out.  So where are you headed?
That was Peterson upstairs.
Kevin and Molly are on their way to Montana.  Who the hell is he to do this to my family, Sidney? Answer me that...!
He'd know it from articles he's read about Lecktor...
That could be the tip of a 't.  Here and here. And here.
Library of Congress.
Typed him from semen. He's a secretor.
As long as they're dead...
Get him to Atlanta.
You think I'm gonna spot him 'across a crowded room?'  That's Ezio Pinza you're thinking about.  The Tooth Fairy will go on until we get smart or get lucky. He won't stop.
If the Documents section can't do it... I'll send it up to Langley...
What if it encourages the Tooth Fairy to do something besides write?
I'll tell you in a second. Now listen to me: everything is okay, I'm taking care of it, so stay on the phone when I tell you.
It says: 'Graham home, 3860 DeSoto Highway, Marathon, Florida. Save yourself. Kill them all.  It's your home address, Will. The bastard gave him your home address.
There's no connection between the families.
You mean Jacobi put it in between when this film was made and when he was murdered?
Don't talk to me!!
We want the cans the Jacobi home movies came in.  They're in the far corner of the room under the windows.
I want a chopper on the roof in three minutes. To Meigs Field.  At Meigs have them warn up and flight- prep the Gulf Stream.
Shooting at maybe eight feet. I can't use any lights.
When do you need it?
Uh-huh.
It's a surprise.
I'll get it.  Stay right here. You look very good in the sun...
No. Reba...?
I want her! I want her alive...  I'm going to keep her! YOU HEAR ME!!!
Atoning, Mr. Lounds.
Do you believe God is in attendance here, Mr. Lounds?
Mr. Lounds, you're a reporter.  You're here to titillate your readers. If you don't open your eyes, I'll staple your eyelids to your forehead.
Yes...
Do you see?
You'll let me go now?
Absolutely,
When you saw Dr. Lecktor's murders, their 'style,' so to speak, were you able to reconstruct his fantasies? And did that help you identify him?
Hi, Linda. ..
I'll bet she has a call caddy right next to her phone.
3680 DeSoto Highway. Marathon, Florida.
Goodbye.
Nine that we know of. Two didn't die.
What happened to them?
It's at the vet's. The kids brought it in with a puncture wound in the abdomen. icepick or an awl.
No.
I'm a forensic specialist, Molly. You've seen my diploma?  I got a diploma and everything.
It's me. I'll call you tomorrow, sweetheart. Go back to sleep.  I love you...
Tell me about yourself.
Where we're at is nowhere. We have nothing. We're running out of time.
Mama has all Kevin's uncles and aunts coming down from Cheyenne next week and...
Okay. They're full of shit and they make me sick...
That's right.
Yes. Who are you?
I told my dad before he died, I'd take care of Mom. And I'll do it.  This guy wants to kill you?
We don't know that.
You went in the apartment?
Huh?
It's about Atlanta and Birmingham.
Do you dream much, Will?
I haven't decided yet.
Fight what?
Why does it feel good?
It's a veddy small island in de Caspian Sea.  It sunk. GEORGE Oh.  Hm.  I'm uh, sorry.  Well, look, I'm probably out of my mind -- but I think you're very interesting.  If you ever need representation... we should talk.
George, I hate sitcoms.
Those are my terms.
The ONLY reason I did Taxi was so I could have my own Special!
That's because they've only seen it once.  But I'll do it again, and again, and AGAIN...  They'll catch on!
You've got good days and bad days.
No no no, it's not sex!  I mean -- it can lead to sex... but really, it's just wrestling.
I mean -- uh -- the colors in the sky are so vibrant.  I love this time of day.
Yes.
Okay.  You're probably right.
DON'T TOUCH ME!
Then your father's a wimp.
Hey -- that stuff gets written-up in the papers --
So HELP ME!  All I wanna do is MEDITATE!!
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I know!  Wink wink!  Nudge nudge!
I don't know what yer talkin' about. You musta talked to someone else --
Kaufman's a lying bastard!  If you sign him, I'll RUIN YOU!
Bob, Andy needs to RELAX.  See if you can get him away from all this. Take him to Hawaii, or Bali... Find something special.  Something nice...
I used to think you were original.
Who knows?!  That kid is totally meshuga.
Bob Gorsky.
The orders were for your protection.
An accident?!
What are you doing?
Honestly.  Morpheus.  He got them all amped up believing in bullshit. I watched each of them take on an agent and I watched each of them die.  Little piece of advice:  you see an agent, you do what we do; run.  Run your ass off.
Nearest exit is Franklin and Erie. An old appliance store.
Goddamnit!
Go.
What if he isn't the One, Morpheus? How can you be so sure?
Five minutes.  Maybe six.
Stand up and see for yourself.
Right now?
How?!
Your muscles have atrophied.  We're rebuilding them.
I'm trying to free your mind, Neo, but all I can do is show you the door.  You're the one that has to step through.  Tank, load the jump program.
The beginning?
Of the Resistance.
That I would find the One.
She told you exactly what you needed to hear.  That's all.  Sooner or later, Neo, you're going to realize just like I did the difference between knowing the path and walking the path.
Do it!
Your next life, maybe.  Who knows. That's how these things go.
They're watching you, Neo.
Who is?
Easy, Neo.  Easy.
How much like it?  Was it the same cat?
We have to!
Why?
Because...
I'm coming with you.
No.
Duck!
I don't know.  I lost him.
Look fella...this is private...
All right!  Quiet!  For $40 I could give you...
A check?  What the...hey, where you kids from?
How do you know?
You flew before?
Yeah, well thanks, but I got enough to hold me.  My mother can send me some.  I don't know.
Sure.  And you're gonna take the vows next Tuesday, right.
Not quite...but keep trying.
I could have told you that.
Did you see them run!
That's not going to help.
What you're doing for me isn't worth it...believe me!
No you're not...
NO!!!  What do you think I am, crazy???
Come on.
I'll be here.  Don't worry.
Get him in.
Ok...that's it.
Nevamind 'look'...This punk bastard...I call him at work...I say 'Johnny Boy there?'...He doesn't even show up for work anymore...
We'll be here.
Fine.
No, I'm serious...You're really good.
In a little while...I'm gonna have the opportunity of opening my own place...not here...much nicer than this...uptown...sort of nite-club and restaurant and everything.
That's nice.
Oh...around...why?
What did he do?
...The one who's sick, right?  In the head.
No, c'mon...Y'know, I read.
Wha?
Here.
Charlie...?
Nobody knows anything, believe me.
You know...like restaurants, night clubs...
Take your time.  I don't care.
I know you don't.  You've been very preoccupied lately.
Uhuh...probably a good idea.  Why don't you do it this time?
Well you can't blame them in a way.
The green capsules in the top drawer.
The girls like it loud.
 Shut up.
No.
I lay awake nights in a cold sweat, I want this party to be like some- thing Mom would have made for you, I want it to be perfect --
Conflict, honey.  Korean Conflict.
You know, we're going to give this party for you whether you like it or not.
I like it.  I like it.  I'm sorry I don't seem more appreciative.
I wasn't going to say --
Well sir, it's 9:30 in the morning.
You're taking this too far, Drew.
Joe sounds like a ringer, Bill.  I have the feeling you guys got the broad strokes already.  Need any help with the details?
And a glass.
It's just a saying, Mr. Black,
Maybe, who knows?  You know how voices are.  Let's go.
Olympic.
So I am to understand from your re- sponse that you do not want to hear the details of Bontecou's offer?
Joe, you do get around.
'It's up to Joe'?  Those were his words?
But I didn't mean to do it!
No, no.  I on holiday.
She knows how she feel.
Hi, Jennifer.
Didn't the family get together last night --?
You love Allison, don't you?
What do you mean 'free'?
That is not my intention.
I've got plenty of friends.
Goodnight to you, Susan.
I think you want to go to the west wing.  Through there.
I don't have any time to see you now.  I'm doing grand rounds and then I'm examining back-to-back patients until dinner and then --
Watch me do what?
Whatever you do.
It wasn't an intrusion.  And if it was, it turned out to be welcome.
And I appreciate you, too.
I don't know who you are.
I loved it.
Yes!
It beats a surgical, doesn't it?
We know all that we need to know --
'Love will find out the way'.
'Threw' you?  Where?
Good night to you, Bill.
So you understand the concept then. When you're busy here, your work, what your task is, is being executed elsewhere.
So you've grasped the idea.  Con- gratulations.  Now multiply it by infinity and take it to the depth of forever, and you still will have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about.
How about giving a guy a break?
This part I'm interested in.
I guess...
How about you telling me?  When I ask a simple question, I expect a straight answer.  That's what I'm used to.  Anybody who doesn't give it to me, I fire.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I picked you for your verve, your excellence, and for your ability to - how shall I say - instruct.  You've lived a first-rate life.  And I find it eminently usable.
Cut the 'Bill' crap out -- you sonofabitch.
What are you saying, that it's time to go?
Then what is it?
An indictable offense.
I am not a dream.
What?
Try.  Because 'if you haven't tried, you haven't lived'.
It's enough now.
Watch it!
I'm doing great.  You ready?
But I've got to tell you, if mergers are in the wild, I've got some great prospects I've developed.  I want to talk to you about them next week.
Yeah - Bill - How are you?  You okay?
If you're trying to show me lay- down-in-front-of-the-bus loyalty, forget it.
That's for me.  I'm talking about you.  It's not so much what you say about Drew, it's what you don't say.
Will it?...
Nothing to be sorry about.  That's the way with men and women, isn't it?
What's the way?
Everybody's a doctor around here. This apartment house is all green pajamas and slippers.  The guy I'm waiting for to vacate is a doctor. What kind of doctor?
Did I say something wrong?
Why not?
I've got to get back for the evening shift, so make yourself at home, watch T.V., whatever. Just grab a blanket and pillow off the bed. I never need them all anyway.
From what?
I'm Mr. Shelby from 304.
Couple days.
This isn't my room?
No, let's go.
Yeah?
* I'm not too good on the phone. I need to		    * look people in the eye when I talk to			  * them.							    *
You did.
I just want you to tell me how you came by that car.
Yeah, I remember you.
You Jimmy Grantz?							  *
I don't want your fucking money!
Who is he? What have you got me into?
There are things you know for sure.
Who did he go to meet?
Why would you do that?
Just take it easy, this isn't my fault.
I want you to forget the company you work for for thirty seconds, and tell me if you really think that Sammy is faking his condition.
You've read it a hundred times.
So I see. It's good to see you. My name's Teddy.
Yeah, yeah. I heard enough about him. Tell me about John G. You still think he's here, right?
Yeah, well I go on facts, not recommendations, okay?
I might have fallen asleep before I did.
Give me your keys.
You like it? Let's trade.
She's involved with these drug dealers.
Maybe. Maybe just.
I never said he was faking! I never said that!
You exposed him for what he was: a fraud.
Why would I do that?						    *
Why would I have a gun?
Fuck you; I gave you a reason to live and		   * you were more than happy to help. You lie		   * to yourself! You don't want the truth,			 * the truth is a fucking coward. So you			  * make up your own truth.						 *
And...?
It's a rip and a hit.
You can't.
Meth precursors and the Dutch party favors are en route.
Okay.
Where's that?
Are you afraid?  Good.  And you don't need a visa. Cause you're with me.
Angola.  My mother was being a surgeon there.  She volunteered. Mozambique and Mali, too...  ...those days, in those days...she was part of Cuba's gift to the third world.  She came from a bourgeois family with a house in Verdado...we still have the house. We will go there...
"Probable"...applies to an event that may be real.  Doesn't apply here.
That's right.
And you're our thirty-percent partner?
Do I need it?
Really?
Sure.  As far away and as fast as you can.
This is the talk of a man...if he were your husband...he would never put you at risk.  He would never put you within a thousand miles of anything that could hurt you.
And if I were in the Comoros, in the Indian Ocean, where would you be...?
Sonny Burnett...this is my partner, Rico.
I'll be there.
What'd Neptune tell you?
I confess I have succumbed to my weaknesses.  An inability to see another's point of view.  I've discussed it with professionals.  Even with one of your friends.  She's here now...
Skin has to touch skin.  That's the requirement for the warrant.  Then he makes a credible excuse and he stops....  Her crew blackmailed and asset- stripped the last mark down to his social security...
Something's wrong.
That way we do not waste AvGas or our motherfucking time.
What kind of weight?
You worried about the tree line, US Customs AWACS, or something else on your mind?
...where you're makin' a move on the wife of Archangel de Jesus Montoya?
No.
I would never doubt you.
Switek?
What's your Miami PD badge number?
"Buy and walk"?  "Buy and bust"? "Reverse undercover"?  What?
And the deal goes down at another place at another time.
NLR, we think.  I wanna know...
How do we do that?  Make a buy?  That went well...
From the North Valle area.  New. Low-level, we think.
Who's the "we"?  There's you and there's us.  And all we got from you was bad intel.  "Low-level producer."  Yeah, right...
We don't know.  And that's the point.  Maybe there's a mole. Whatever, it's a disaster.  And it's a Joint Interagency Task Force.  I have DEA, ATF, U.S. Customs components in on it.  So the penetration could be from any one agency.  What we do know is I have to suspend operations right now from undercover work through interdictions 'cause I have to assume our Operational Security is blown.
The bouquet, here.  Five-hundred dollars worth of roses...yellow.
...you are trying to reassure me because you know when people get anxious, they make mistakes. You're worried about me.  Do not be.  I am careful.  I am cool.  I got Trudy, backup, whatever.  You worry about you.  Because you are the ones who are in denied territory, not me.  If your focus is on me, you'll miss something coming at you.  That's how people slip up. Get hurt.  And I'd die if anything happened.  You worry about <u>you</u>. You and Sonny...are in the dangerous place.  I'm fine...
A good deal, like this with us, for Burnett will be good only temporarily.  He'll get restless because he believes nothing is forever.  Life is dust, make it while you can.  He's ambitious.
Two, three thousand a ki. Two thousand ki's, your end is $6,000,000.  Complex transshipments or dealing with containers, these have front- loaded costs we pickup.  For this kind of weight, the balance of 80% is when our buyer picks up the load.  Transactions are offshore.  Dollars or euros.  Secure internet transfers.  We have lists of Cayman and Isle of Man banks infiltrated by IRS, to be avoided...  No transactions of cash or other banking instruments take place on U.S. soil...  That's the deal.
Of course!  That is why I placed myself here, with you, knowing Yero would pull this crap.
<u>You</u> give <u>yours</u> to me.  <u>We</u> position all the assets hauling our loads...
The Feeb gig was I front a coupla undercover, Russian-speakers to them.  One's ATF.  And broker the deal.  Set up the meet with the NLR types...
What...?
The Statue of Liberty.
Said, a person's gotta make a living.
Yeah?
No, ma'am, I'm not.
Sure you're all right?
No. Of course not. Just something struck me funny...
I ain't sleepy.
Oh, it ain't cheap. I mean, yeah, I'd say this was an all right shirt. Don't like to, uh, you know, have a lot of cheap stuff on my back.
For money.
I think you just put your finger on it, I do.
What's all this sweet talk about Florida? Your friend O'Daniel got a stable down there now?
What'll happen. I mean what they do to, you know, do with you -- if you can't -- ah, Christ!
I don't even want you to go. Whaddya think of that? I got other plans for my life than dragging around some dumb cowboy that thinks he's God's gift to women. One twenty-buck trick and he's already the biggest stud in New York City. It's laughable.
Sounds like they knew you.
No sir, I'm no cowboy really, but I'm a first class stud.
Yes, I believe you are. Cowboy, huh?
This Pensacola teeny-bopper -- jail bait -- but built? Ten bucks she wanted. Three of us made a deal for, twenty-five, see, big goddam bargain?
Big peni-goddam-cillin bargain, right?
The airport. Trying to get on the plane for the States.
What?
Listen!
Same. None of the neighbors know. We told them you were in a hospital in Europe.  Oh... this is Stanley Davis. He's the American Consul here... And Necdit Yesil, the lawyer you wanted...
The Hilton.
Well, it's an interesting place...  Tell you the truth, I think the food is lousy. The crap they sell in these little restaurants. I went out to eat in one of them last night, and I had to run to the damn toilet... You shoulda' seen the toilet.
Sixty Lira?
Not far. Just a little way.
How much?
Good. There's nothing to be afraid of. If you co-operate with us, you will be on the plane for New York tomorrow... yes?
Yes...?
Good.  Would you go back to the Pudding Shoppe now and point him out to my men if you see him?
But just...
What did he do?
Hashish.  Ninety percent of the foreigners are in for hashish.
Twelve years.
But he was eating lunch a mile away when the Turk smashed into killed himself.
Aslan, there... 
What do you mean?
Section 13?
Two thirty.
What?
You're right.
Mr. Yesil.
Yeah...?
Take a look.
Please do.  He's a lonely guy.
No, you talkin' at me.
20 minutes. If you don't go sight-seeing anymore.
What?
Nino, please...
Peter, you couldn't even fix our TV!
We're down to a "couple" now, huh?
We?
Maybe they lied to you.
No, there's...
No such thing, baby.
I was just late.
I know.  But if it was carrying something...there's a chance you could have been exposed.
Yeah, barely. We haven't found anything down here. Nothing...
That's camouflage...
The scent won't last...
I can.  We can do this...
Just like Trump Tower, then.
She used a baster.
I have no idea.  Are you ready?
Will I be able to walk?
Nothing.
The profanity bothers you?
No. No, it isn't, it's--  --oh pooh, I can't think of any words. Would "great" be insulting?
I can live with "great."
I'm getting to believe you.
Of course I'll like it. Misery's about to have her child. What's it gonna be, a boy or a girl? Ooh, don't tell me.
You're such a kidder. I have a big surprise for you. But first there's something you must do.
You want me to burn my book?
Paul, what you've written just isn't fair.
--cliff-hangers--
I know that, Mister Man--they also call them serials. I'm not stupid, you know.  Anyway, my favorite was Rocket Man, and once it was a no-brakes chapter, the bad guys stuck him in a car on a mountain road and knocked him out and welded the doors shut and tore out the brakes and started him to his death and he woke up and tried to steer and tried to get out, but the car went off a cliff before he could escape and it crashed and burned and--I was so upset and excited and the next week you better believe I was first in line and they always start with the end of the last week and there was Rocket Man trying to get out, and here came the cliff and JUST BEFORE the car went off he jumped free and all the kids cheered--  --but I didn't cheer, I stood right up and started shouting, "This isn't what happened last week--have you all got amnesia?--THEY JUST CHEATED US--THIS WASN'T FAIR--"
Yeah, yeah...
...have to wait.
My secret is I only use fresh tomatoes, never canned. And to give it that little extra zip, I mix in some Spam with the ground beef.
Well, it certainly says you.
It's perfect.
But the time is now. Soon others will come.
It's almost done. By dawn we'll be able to give Misery back to the world.
Ahh!!!
You did perfect. Except for one thing. This time we need two glasses.
I don't know. Does he always phone you when he checks out of hotels?
Maybe you can, Libby.
No long-distance phone calls, Federal Express packages--anything at all out of the ordinary?
I'm sure you're right.
Answer me a couple things?
If I can.
Do you have any of those new Paul Sheldon books?
Yeah. They're in the semis.
Billy, make sure Nyah's not followed.
Beats fighting the flu, I'm here to tell you.
I knew where it was.
In other words, you're calling her a flake.
In any case we don't want your cash.
There guys are walking around with different halves of the same dollar bill?
Right.  Just remember, mates.  Billy Baird's the name.  Anything you need to get, move or watch, I'm your man.
He should've have killed the virus in the incubation area..Nyah's exited the elevator on the same level as the lab.
No.  Just as if I'd like to.
I see.  You're not just another pretty face..
Oh, either way works for me.
Sounds smashing.  I'm in.  Muchacho, mi carro, por favor!  Now be serious.  You couldn't possibly want me off tonight's performance..
And six billion in the world.
That's lot of people out there..how many of them, I wonder, are capable of something like that?
I don't.
Annex is strictly off limits to me and they never come to the main house, Michael even takes their meals to them all but shoves them under the door.
Betting table twelve off the paddock. Nyah, are you up to this?
Oh Ethan!..
No time to explain.  You've done well, and we're so close.  So close.  It's critical that you do whatever Ambrose asks.  Don't worry - it'll be over soon.. That's a promise.. Come on, now off you go!
No.
Like what?
'You're sorry and I'm sorry.'
In any case, you've got to recover Chimera and bring it to us.
- right.  In fact since the plane went down our banking sources have confirmed a marked increase in the stock pilling of cash in terrorists accounts.
Well it's not mission <i>difficult,</i> Hunt. It's mission <i>impossible.</i>  Difficult should be a walk in the park for you.  If you can think of a quicker way to get to Ambrose, you're welcome to try.  Oh, by the way, you might want to take a look at these..if you have any further qualms about getting her to do the job.
Yes, I believe that's right.  Now my understanding is that 20 hours after exposure, the victim becomes infectious. Highly infectious.
And the only other remaining sample was in the canister you recover from Ambrose.
And that appears to have been destroyed. It also contained the anti-virus, Bellerophon.
Sorry it couldn't be under happier circumstances.
..not in time to save him.
What's happening here?  You're dead!
Oh, please!  How was I to know they had to be treated with Bellerophon within twenty hours?
Heís putting on a show, Barnes.
Sleeping's better.
What?
Ethan, you're not making sense. Let me go in and talk to Kittridge. I'm going to tell him you had nothing to do...
We need help, and we don't have time. They have to be local.
This stuff is so sticky.
My team.  Claire, Jack, even Jim - - Hannah, maybe, I -- donít know
Do you read me?  <u>The list is in the open</u>!
No sir.
Yeah.  I follow you.
You mean <u>I've</u> lost enough agents for one night.
Let's see if you can follow me around this room.  The drunk Russians on the embankment at 7 and 8 o'clock...The couple waltzing around me at the Embassy at 9 and 11. The waiter behind Hannah at the top of the staircase - Bowtie, 12 o'clock. The other IMF team.  You're worried about me. <u>Why</u>?
That's right.  Max, it seems, has two unique gifts -- a capacity for anonymity and for corrupting susceptible agents. This time he's gotten to someone on the inside - he's put himself in a position to buy our NOC list. An operation he referred to as "Job 314".  The job he thought Golitsyn was doing tonight.
Ethan, I can understand you're very upset.
If you're dealing with someone who's crushed, stabbed, shot and detonated five members of his own IMF team, how devastated do you think you're going to make him by marching Ma and Uncle Donald down to the county courthouse?
There was never any physical evidence that I had anything to do with that.. that..  With that exceptional piece of work.
Luther, relax, it's worse than you think. The terminal's in black vault lock-down.
What makes you trust me?
It's all one big negotiation, isn't it?
Oh man...I don't know.  I'm gonna miss being disreputable.
Well, Luther - if it makes you feel any better I'll always think of you that way.
It's easy to say the disk is worthless when you say I can't look at the information and <u>see</u> if it's worthless. Not a tenable position, sir.
Mm - Hmmm...
Tell you what.  How good's the RF scanner you used in the car?
Very good.
We're not outta here yet.
Give me a break, Pops.
Roger that.  Opening doors now.
Right, right.  Good.
Jim gave an abort, we should walk away.
Why?
You misunderstood.  No one sees Max.
Very well.
A hundred and sixty-seven, I think it is. Take it all, if you want.  <u>After</u> this one.
- and picked us up in the States -
Hey, I showed 'em to you!
Tight security.  No guns.  Real plus.
If I supposedly deliver the NOC list to Max, Max has agreed to deliver Job to me. Iíll have Claire and Luther Stickell with me on the train.  Marcel Krieger will have helicopter transport waiting in Paris.
Loud and clear.
You're welcome.
Johnny Cammareri. I think it's great and about time. What's she gonna do with the rest of her life she don't get married?
I know you don't. That's the point. I'll say no more.
What are you doing here?
I don't know. I got a feeling.
I have no life.
Maybe I should come back another time.
You don't have to help me.
Where'd Johnny find you?
I'm a wolf?
I am looking where I should to become a bride!
I was dead.
Last night never happened, you hear me? I'm gonna marry him anyway and last night never happened, and you and I are gonna take this to our coffins!
I can't!
I wanna go home.
You're making me feel guilty again.
No.
No. I'm gonna wait.
Loretta, what are you talking about?
Then let's set the date.
He's my younger brother.
Sure.
The waitresses were very nice.  My mother is slipping away.
We should talk alone.
Loretta, I can't marry you.
A wife knows.
Your hair's different.
Hey there  ...YOU WITH THE STARS IN YOUR EYES...
Alright.
That's incredible.
That was my father-in-law, who has a wrong idea in his head. Listen, Johnny, there's a question I want to ask you. And I want you to tell me the truth if you can. Why do men chase women?
Well. There's the Bible story. God took a rib from Adam and made Eve. Maybe men chase women to get the rib back. When God took the rib, he left a hole there, place where there used to be something. and the women have that. Maybe a man isn't complete as a man without a woman.
But why would a man need more than one woman?
Then tell her I'll come by in the morning. We need to talk.
Johnny...
And you are a son who doesn't love his mother!
She didn't hear me. She asked me to repeat, so she could understand what I said. But I wouldn't repeat it. Outta shyness. So I'm a bachelor.
Yes.
Then why are you eating alone?
I'm too old for you.
I live in a one-bedroom apartment. What exactly does your husband do?
He's a plumber.
Well. That explains it.
I mean it's that moon I was talking about at dinner.  Is he down there? No.
Shut up. They'll hear you in the back.
I knew she had it.
Bring her forward.
It is I, Arthur, son of Uther Pendragon, from the castle of Camelot.  King of all Britons, defeator of the Saxons, sovereign of all England!
What?  Ridden on a horse?
Not at all.  They could be carried.
We don't have a lord.
Who are they?
You said it again!
'Tis but a scratch.
No, it isn't.
You're a liar.
Come on then.
Course I have.
Bedevere, my Liege.
Well now, Launcelot, Galahad, and I wait until nightfall and then leap out of the rabbit and take the French by surprise, not only by surprise but totally unarmed!
No!  Not the Knights Who Say "Ni"!
Just keep me covered.
Yes, I can help you with your guest.
What?
What?
Be quiet!  I order you to shut up.
I mean, if I went around saying I was an Emperor because some moistened bint had lobbed a scimitar at me, people would put me away!
Course it's a good idea.
And therefore?
Blue.
To seek the Grail!
What is the capital of Assyria?
I dunno, Must be a king.
Thank you, sir, most kind ...
I can understand that.
Herbert ...  We built this castle on a bloody swamp, we need all the land we can get.
Shut your noise, you,  and get that suit on!
Until you, or anyone else ...
Yes.  It's not a very good name, is it?  But we are nice and we shall attend to your every ... every need!
What is your name, handsome knight?
Ector.
Back to your bed!  At once!
I'm sorry, I must go.
Stop saying the word!  The word we cannot hear!  The word ...
That rabbit's got a vicious streak. It's a killer!
I didn't.
What?
You watch your tongue.
She means it.
It's what the maids are for.
Mary Taylor, sir.
Are you all right, Barney?
I take no account of gossip, Your Highness.
Of course.
I beg your pardon?  Mama...?
Are you deaf as well as stupid?
Do you know who you address, sir?
Yes.  I do.
That can wait till the weekend.
Do you hunt?
It's nothing.
Her mind is set.  She won't change now.
For once in my life, I am not the issue.
But others will know that you acted for the greater good.
You are here safely.
I am.
Because I think Her Majesty is wrong. If ever there was a poor soul who needed fresh air, it is her.
Aye.  But there are Fenians reported on the mainland.
Having considered my position here at court, I have come to the conclusion that it is in the best interest of Your Majesty that I should resign.
I came as quickly as I could.
Well, both.
My dear Stanley, a Prime Minister with only a handful of friends must respect public opinion.
From Princess Helena and other members of your family.
My family is quite capable of communicating with the Queen in person.
What is the matter with him?
Sure.
Sure.  Every game's got 'em.  I'll start with the schematics.  I can print these up if you want.
Level Ten.  That's where you've got to unlock ARCADE's heart using the keys you've found.
There's something wrong with ARCADE. The game's alive somehow...
Actually, no.  I was just telling Nick, here, that my t.v.'s busted...
Yeah...
Have you played the game yet?  It's incredible!  I was just...
Listen to me!  Greg never came home. I think the game has something to do with it.
What the hell are you talking about?
Alex, I think you're freaking out. Greg's gone, I'll give you that.  And maybe he's in trouble.  But it's not ARCADE that's doing it...
How?!  It's a machine, Alex. Machine's don't think.  They're not alive.  It's a good program, a brilliant program, it was designed so it would act as if it were alive, but it's not alive.
You imagined it.
Call the others.  Laurie, Benz...
Let's go around back.
Like the fractals?
What are you going to do?
I don't want anything to happen to you.  I care about you.
I already have a boyfriend, Nick.
You've got the schematics, check.
The keys are supposed to be at the end of each level.  Once we get all the keys, we can unlock ARCADE's heart. And then...
Right, then...
Check your read-out.
I just thought of something.  If we came back from the game...  ...what if ARCADE did too?
So tell me you're okay, then.
Well, it's a long story...
In this world, wrong is right!
Is that your question?
Of course I am.
Of course I can.  I can say all sorts of things...
Home! Meet me at the office. We've got to do something ... you've got to do something Adam!
Something tells me this guy is connected with what's happening, Adam, and I think you should do it and I think you should do it right away.
Git along little dowgie and call me back.
Well now, here's a man who wants to get right to it. Kinda anxious to get to it are ya?
Now I know a few things. I know you have had a rough day. You're probably thinkin' I don't know the half of it, but in actual fact I know every part of it. The business of gittin' thrown off your movie, the heartache of seeing your wife with another man... losin' access to that precious film vault...
Now I guess you and your Aunt have an understanding. So here's the key and you need anything, just give a holler.  Everybody in this building's pretty much okay with me or they wouldn't be here. If you want, later I'll introduce you around. No hard feelings if you don't, and don't forget the rooftop garden. It's just up the stairs we passed. It's open to all the tenants. You can see the Hollywood sign from there.
It's just for a night or two, until she finds her own place. I tried to explain that to Aunt Ruth, but the connection was bad and her plane was leaving and she got it all mixed up. I kept telling her it was my friend and she kept saying she didn't know any Ritas ...
Thanks Coco. It'd be so embarrassing
Good luck, honey!
I understand. I saw the dress. I...I'm sorry.   Are you all right?
Oh my god. I'm sorry. I'll let you get back to that. I'm going to get unpacked.
Yeah ... Betty. You don't rush it. I don't rush it. We play it close, just like in the movies.
Yes, there was.
I switched apartments with her. She's in #17. Just walk down that way. It's just to the right.
How do you remember how to talk?
That's where I was going... Mulholland Drive.
"I can call them... I can call my dad... "
"Then they'd put you in jail."
No.
But I want to.
Keep her from gettin' in trouble, that's all.
It must be just so pathetic being you. Sure Billy, grab your dog we'll eat in the van.
Oh yeah.
Find out who they are?
Interesting.
Palmdale.
Unreal ... so, you're looking good. Whatcha doin' these days?
Well, not much Ed. Just doin' some stuff for this guy.
I'm an investment banker. I see blood bathes everyday. Besides, mine is not to question why, min is but to do or die.
Who the hell are you anyway ? What is this place ?
NO ! I wouldn't do that.
Why would he ? His parents are rich.
We drown.
I'd say about thirty to forty minutes. Give or take a few.
It was there, clear as day. I saw the computer records. Matthew has been fed wiring money to his personal account.  I just knew something was wrong.
McCay had a lot money done into researching psychological reactions to questions that are seemingly unrelated, but reveal everything. Like criminal impulses, homicidal impulses.....
What do you do with the company, if I might ask ?
I'm in charge of the conversions.  When First Bank buys another smaller bank, I'm in charge of converting them to our systems and way of doing things.
Yeah, real cute. The storm is fake, but the lightening is real.
Bye....
Hey , Hey !
Either you'll be shot with bullets, impaled with a large spike, or nailed like a super model. Basically you're fucked any way you go.
And that's different than this because...... ?
Are you hunting wabbits ?
I've been working with you for four years, don't you think that's worthy of at least one turn at the controls ?
For once in your life, shut the fuck up.
I am thirty two.
Yes sir.
Son, let's watch the tape.
I had suggested that they tone down the program so that the "guests" might take longer to expire.
That mail room kid was the longest lasting "guest" yet ! Maybe we can alter the computer records and make another "guest" from the more athletic of our staff.
Bruce may still refuse. It is my belief that he is becoming more belligerent.
Not you Zach.  Remember, my wife is asleep upstairs, dear.  Zach, am I gonna like what I see on this tape ? Is it the grandest of all the Park's tapes ?
Sir ? We're moving them right along as fast as we can.
I'm just looking for our best interests. May I have the tapes, Bruce ?
I'll see that bet.
Well, Mr. Parker it seems that your is not the wardrobe of choice tonight. I'm quite confident that my tie is looking better than yours.
I can see that but where ?
He's got two chices.either it's the Bowling Alley from Hell or Alice in Murderland. See this ? Even Bruce knows that no one can make it out of here in one piece.
I've never heard the Flintstones reduced to a sexual exploitation quite like that. You're funny.
Really ? On a date ?
Thank you, won't you come in ?
Actually, I'm more interested in the man behind the wheel more than the manufacturer. So what is it that you have that makes you a materialistic fool ?
Fine, fine, I feel like a chicken McNugget.
Four years. I came over from the Capitol merger in Chicago six months ago.
Humph, meee?? My dear, this is not a country that rewards poetry, this is a country that rewards gas mileage, besides, people don't read poetry anymore, they watch television. Don't be a poet, be a TV repairman.
Well if I was looking for a victim, I definitely wouldn't pick your Uncle Phil who outweighs me by about 150 pounds, besides, who would I ask for ransom? You??
I don't even know your name.
What about living in the real world pal?
I think the phrase was &quot;Sleazoid Geek&quot;.
Hello, I'm gonna need this right now...this guy...well we think he might be going after the governor.  Twenty minutes? Fine.
Well you know what I mean.
Honey that's very mature, I'm proud of you Vada.
Seriously?
Seriously.
Hi honey.
Totally.
Ask him if he needs a good tuba player.
Well you should at least try a little bit.
Then I'll throw up a little bit.
She is not a child Harry, she is a young woman, she's on the brink of...
Maybe he's hungry.
I'm sorry, it's just...I've been taking all these seminars to get in touch with my feelings and...sometimes it gets out of hand.
Oh.  Ohhh?
Maggie...Maggie's little girl.
Well I didn't know about you until after she was gone.
I know that.
He likes you.
Likes me? He said I looked like a grasshopper.
I'm sure she did. 
But we made a business deal.
I won't.
I got it all figured out, I know she went to Wilson High School, so first thing tomorrow, I'm gonna go there and get a copy of her yearbook. That way I can get the names of all the people she was in clubs with and found out who her friends were.
Excuse me, pardon, thank you, excuse me.
Oh my gosh, here it is!
ehh...Okay...but be careful, it has a lot of sentimental value.
Don't force it, you'll break it.
Just give it to me!!
Really?
And you'd be my cousin?
Yeah I guess...sort of.
Nick?
What's it for?
For the mini-bike fund.
Phil, I think you should consider... fades as Vada walks off
You stay out of this, look, if I had a red XK-150 with a black interior, I sure as hell wouldn't be handing out relationship advice.
He was very polite, worth the entire five dollars.
I'd like to see his house but...I don't know if I'd have the nerve to just go up and knock on his door. I don't think I can go through with it.
You want me to come with?
You know exactly...what kind it is. Come on Rose...what do you want from me?
Nothing, nothing at all.
I'm a pediatric cardiologist.
Let's just say I...eh...I'm involved.
Hungarian. Famous for their beautiful music...and beautiful women.
Oh, sure okay.
Well, it must mean something. She was obviously very sentimental.
No. You know they say, that it never rains, that you can barbecue on Christmas day...instead of riding your bike, you just surf over to your friends house. Oh, and the place is just crawling with celebrities. I know someone who saw Walter Matthau picking up his dry-cleaning.
What do you mean?
You leave your father to me.
O.K.
Everybody did, walk along Citrus between Fountain and Sunset any afternoon.
I would have tried to show her a good time. I promised her when she left that I would never forget her and I never did. Stanley Rosenfeld does not forget.
Well, sometimes when we get 'em, they're not completely dead, you know, like when they cut a chickens head off and it still runs around crazy.
Yeah, all right...
It's there.
I'm a licensed cosmetologist, I worked for two years, at the &quot;Dino Raphael&quot; Salon, all my customers cried when I told them I was leaving.
What do you mean??
She was raised in a funeral home, she knows a thing or two about it.
Nothing, I was just wondering what you were doing.
Oh, I'm just typing up a funeral notice, you know when someone dies people want it in the paper usually, it's a service we provide for the family.
What's that?
Are you mad at me?
See, you're not that out of touch.  You're good.
Kiss me.
Honestly Harry, he got the mustang, I promise.....
Dad?
I love this guy! 
Dad, why are you dressed up to go to bingo?
Well Shelly's coming over, we're gonna go together.
No sweetheart, you can't.
Ahh, that little Chevy was your mothers favorite car.
What was my mama like?
Really? Already? The summer's just begun.
Well I'm gonna teach creative writing this summer, so, I'm doing some work.
Thirty five dollars.
Me, two hours a week, talking about poetry. This an interrogation Vada?
It's summer! You're kids! Go play!
For this class?
Please.
Oh, Vada...
I love you like my Dad loves Shelly. I wanna live here.
Does he love her?
I am.
I'm not upset. I will never play with those girls. I only surround myself with people who I find intellectually stimulating.
Chocolate?
He won't give it to me.
Ohh, right. Would you like a soda?
Daddy said it's bad when people get divorced.
I think lipstick looks fake, no-ones lips are that color.
The boys at school don't think I am.
See food!
This is Danny and Ralph, they own the Dino Raphael salon in Detroit.  We used to be married.
Are you here to take Shelly back?
Oh great!!
What do you mean you're hemorrhaging?
I'm allergic to it.
I can't, I have to go home.
No, I don't wanna.
What do you think it's like?
What?
He likes her better than me.
It is not.
No.
Here, practice on your arm like this.
But then I won't be able to see anything.
Umm, Ummmmm
... I don't send you men, anymore. You don't know what to do with them.
The wandering sportswriter.
He says, "Swear.  When we're both 28, if we've never been married... we marry each other!"
We're about to find out.
... and having "done the right thing" will only really be comforting, oh, maybe, five, six times.
And you believe that.
Someday she'll thank you.
Well, we're...
You need a few dollars.
... you want a menage on your wedding night.
Which was the disqualifying factor?
He said that, too.
So it's sweet of you to be protective...
Bad games, bad towns, bad pay, bad flights, bad hotels, real bad food. Homeless, rootless, lonely, maybe your copy gets into one issue out of four...
... unless he has a hump.
Except for that.
ISN'T THERE A GUARD?  A JANITOR? A FUCKING CLEANING WOMAN? I'LL TAKE A BURGLAR!  SOMEBODY'S GOTTA BE IN TH...
Look, I came down here to face everybody.  I didn't want to slink away like some coward...
Well.  How come she didn't...
Love doesn't have to be right. It just has to be love.
I was so confused, so conflicted, so... unstable.
... yeah, that.
I'm just thinking of how she's hurting.  Lost.  Alone.  Like her life is over.
Like family, huh?
To him.
You got a real good memory, Star.
Well, I just wondered 'cause being from out or town I wouldn't be able to make anything.
Then why are you listening to her -
You're so good.
I'll tell Ester, she'll be thrilled I saw you again.
Bye, Bye.
I guess that's why he thought you right want to help out.
How is that?
His Word.
D.C.
Your brother?
Yes. I was in my Sophomore year at Harvard.
How in the world did he get shot?
That's good,  I've never seen anything so healthy.
How'd you get in here.
Didn't you get?... How are you?
Good night,
Did an exploratory and according to them, she needed an overhaul.
I said, maybe I'll change my name again.
You must really like him.
I haven't gotten into politics yet. I'm still into music --except for you. You're into politics.
I'm in a hurry, gonna see this great group record at Woodland.
You got a place to stay?
Oh... Well.
I don't know his first name.
I've been a Little dyspeptic.
When I was little, in church.
It just is.
And before?
Or course. You should come over to the house. The boys would love to meet you.
What do you mean?  You said you wanted to see me.
Who is this, right?  I called you last night.
Oh.
Premeditated murder.
Just got out. Had me thirteen lawyers. Missed the electric chair twice. .. Been out three months. Are you heavy?
Sleep. That's all I need. Don't want to waste no time sleeping. You married?
What...?  0h, yes.
It's me. What is it?
Yes.
Might be good for you.
You're not.
Probably a little too long.
I'll be damned. Boy, if you could get Ryan to say something about Hal Phillip Walker, wouldn't that be something?
Yes you are.
So, I think it would be safe to say that anybody who studied the fighting style that Bruce Lee, arguably the greatest martial artist of all times, developed for nine years, that would be a fella who could defend himself. Would you describe Tim that way, Grace?
Don't stop!
Thank you, sir.
I've never wounded anything in my life. I got you locked right between the eyes.
She was born without a tongue.
There's a chocolate cream filled in there?
Have you talked to Mallory about this?
Aside from the obvious?
I'm sure we will.
Says who?
No.
Are you kidding? The Golden Globe, The Edward R. Murrow award...
Just save your breath, Wayne. We hate you. If anybody in the fuckin' world deserves to die, it's you.
Mickey, you're wasting time!
Then you've seen the scene where Arnold Schwartzenegger is talking to Lou Ferigno.
And they made the first move?
Where do the air ducts lead?
The entire wing?
Roger, do you understand what the word 'no' means? It's important we establish a rapport. Something as simple as a dozen donuts can mean the world to somebody who hasn't had a donut in a year.
Wayne---
Roger, I'm starting to get pissed. Just drop this fuckin' donut shit, and gather your gear.
Fine. Roger, what the hell are you doing? You're bothering the serial killer.
They're real Goddamn good. They'll be there for when ya need 'em. Where are they?
Me, neither. I don't eat meat.
They passed the 'edge' along to us.
I'm the superintendent here at L.A. County Jail. Me and my deputies are who you'll be working with while you're here.
They got a asshole over here.  A asshole sitting down reading a magazine over there.  A asshole perched up there.  Assholes everywhere. Hey, maybe if we were doin' that kiss, kiss, bang, bang stuff we'd need all those assholes, too. What we're about is intimacy. We're about two people having a conversation. Say I was interviewing you. All I want you to worry about is what I ask you. I want a trust to develop. If you're thinking about all this...  ...you're not going to relax, a trust won't develop, we'll be talking a each other instead of to each other, there will be no chance for intimacy.
I can't do that. Five guys.
Why don't I have Mickey thrown back into his cell and we can forget the whole thing?
Chill out, Phill. Four deputies and you, I can live with that. We're about ready to go here, so let's get rid of these other assholes.
Yeah.
Out.
Want me to come?
It sure is.
You think so, Frankie?
I hear you're tryin' to organize this place!
Then do like I said.  Men - this boy here's got something to tell you-all.  Well, how about it?
Anderson.
'Bout time you showed. Door's open.
I been sendin' her money.
Where's he at?
Just so you do your work.
You working?
No. Never had much use for hell-howlers. You goin'?
Damn few places you can make eighty bucks a week.
How d'you mean?
What d'you mean?
Oh yeah, and then what?
Hell, baby, I don't know what to say.
Yeah. Knocked around for a couple of months after the Army. You been there?
Yeah. Well, I do.
No. Women're always followin' me 'round.
Four.
What's he like?
Okay, I guess.
Just what I said. Don't look so scared.
Yeah. Wouldn't be no picnic for you. I ain't exactly housebroken.
Oh really? I thought it was pretty good.
Uh-huh. Why?
Don't look so scared.
I keep thinking about him.
Well, he ain't mine, so skip it.
Yeah.
About ten dollars.
You can have what I've got. It's right there.
Like hell they can't.  They can reach right in with their damn white hands and turn you off and on.
When I get set, I'll send for you.
Duff--
I bet she's easy jam.
Well, it's better than windin' up like a bum.
Man, you must be plumb outa your mind! You'll be makin' twen'y bucks a week, if you're lucky.
'Got a good thing, man.
Yeah. That's right, Jocko.  Those white guys sure shoot up at you like a yeast cake if you just cock an eye at them.
Okay.
What d'you want anyhow? What you come and bother me for?
Okay.
Whenever he's got an edge on.
Sure.
Well, what're you going to do?
Going back, huh?
'Musta knocked her up.
Just give him a couple of months. A girl like that, she don't know any tricks.
You know what Doris told me? She say: That Duff's a nice guy. Wouldn't even charge him nothin'.
Is that right?  Think you're gonna make it with her?
If you don't quit it, Will, I'm leaving.
You're breaking my heart.  Got to see a man about a dog.
What's the matter now?
Right here.
Since when?
I will.  Inside.  There's no other way to get the gun off the girl's head, Nate.
Negotiator entering Kill Zone.
They're a bit too real for my taste. Will you excuse me for a moment?
No. I only needed the code from you.
Pity. Then you'll both have to die.
He's a vat grown Ninja, the Royal Family's bodyguard. Watch out for him, he's no joke.
They're only guessing, but we can't take any risks.
And how do you suggest I do that?
First, let's get something straight. We ran a psych construct on you that lists self destruction as your favourite pastime. If you want to kill yourself, Mr. Case, there's much more entertaining ways than working for me.
This one's different. No one can trace it. It's out there somewhere in the matrix and it's growing stronger... infecting other computer systems like a virus.
Right. Best cowboy that ever punched deck. The old man taught me most of what I know.
What's he doing to my gear?
Did you trace it?
That could work, but the timing will be a bitch.
You'll be linked during the entire operation.
Stick with her. I want the process to become second nature to you. We fly for Freeside at dawn.
The old man cheats on his wife with her own clone?
Patience, Mr. Case. Only one hour and thirty-eight minutes to enlightenment.
Fine, Ratz. Thanks.
Ya learned good. So, what's happening?
What?
I need its matrix coordinates, Dixie. I've got to nail that thing where it lives.
How are we doing?
It ain't getting any prettier, that's for sure. I got the I.D. on this Armitage character. He a bright boy, your friend?
What are you talkin' about?
Not for long. It needs me alive and I still need its access code. You got a better idea?
How long, Dixie?
It's coming.
What?
Why should I want to meet him.
Because you've exceeded your shelf life, Case. Word on the street is you're a dead man walking. Nice time for an employment opportunity. Travel to exotic locales.
What's my end?
You're not ready yet. They said two days.
A regular Fagan.
I'll be okay.
No. It's important to be able to feel those things.  We're going to pull this run off, Molly, and we've got to do it soon.
Or a little self-indulgent to say the least.
Yeah. Let's do that.
What about the "Roaring Twenties"… or "The 80's"?
Anita, when you wanted to seduce the guy in the mailroom and you didn't think you could learn Spanish fast enough, who quizzed you on your verbs?
Very romantic.
And we're going to have to do something about your hair.
You crossed over.
Why?
Five-- Six--
You've done five of my ideas.
A--flack jacket.
Geller, this is way out of your league.
Uhh, no.
Well, how would you define to parties"? Because we ordered a deli platter at this one Denominator drill session--
They hid my car--
OUT!
I bet Good Housekeeping would go gaga over the cole slaw piece.
You're crazy. I can't--I can't-no. No.
And that's the best part.  "Teacher-Student Relations: How close is too close?" We're gonna blow the lid off it!
You know what, though? I feel like I'm really ready to do it. To have sex for the first time.
You can't just "borrow" my car for a couple of months! That's like ten years in Bambi life!
It was a long time ago -
Don't you realize how much I wanted to be you in high school? Just for one minute to feel what it was like to be popular?
But I think she wanted to be happy, that's why she wrote. I mean, she was still writing about love, right?
Your writing. It's amazing, Josie. You're really talented. And far less depressing than Dorothy Parker.
College. Haven't really thought about it.
You do. Seem to. Have passion. In the classroom.
I know.
That's really what we all need, right? Someone to sit up on the wall with us--
Do you think you'll find her?
Yeah, actually I do.
It's weird because "prom" is actually from the word "promenade". And you can't really promenade alone, can you?
I don't! Look, you could get to know me, again.
I know, like five chickens had to die just so she could look that stupid.
It's really hard to do. Some kids try for all of-high school and never make it.
We're very evolved.
I'm handing out a free lei to every customer! What do you think?
Change is scary. Robbie, let me tell you a little something about the mail business. I've been in it over thirty years. And in those thirty years, the only thing that's changed is the Elvis stamp and some gun laws. People are bored! They wanna shake things up!
I thought people just wanted their mail delivered on time.
We went through the door...
<i>                      Jack said we should work together.</i>
<i>                      Three of a kind...</i>
Didn't I tell you?  I'm always right, you know, my dear... Aren't I?
But I guess my best just isn't good enough.
Good.  I'm hungry.
He's conducting experiments of his own.
<i>                      Listen now, you don't understand. That's not the point of Christmasland.</i>
Oh, come on Dad...
What is it then?  There's got to be an explanation.  Animals just don't burst into flames for no reason!
Ken!
There is no Jesse.  I'm Jesse now.
She giving you any carfare for the ride?
Yeah, why?
It was okay.
What are you doing here?
Ah, nothing.
That's okay, I wanted to.
Who, Grady?  Grady's alright, he's just a hothead.
I know.
Yeah?
I just got here myself.  Went to the Public Library.  Cut four classes!
Shhh.  Just concentrate.
I'm not hungry.
Will you leave me alone?  Please.
We'll figure it out together.  We'll stay up all night if we have to.  I won't let anything happen to you.
I can't!
Huh?
First door up the stairs.
I thought I'd wait for you.
I am not going to let you get me into an argument, goddamn it.  Not tonight.  Now get in bed.
Mom?
Can't it wait till morning?
Watching TV.
I can see that. You watch too damn much TV.
Research.
The city that never sleeps.  So what will you do now?
I -- I think so!
When I was still a kid.  My folks got divorced.  After a while, I thought I'd imagined the whole thing.  I guess I didn't.
I was on the team at school.  I was never very good, though.
Fuck off.
I just wanted to be here for the kids. how are they?
Fucked up chromosomes, man.  Think about it.  Their parents all dropped acid in the Sixties.
That's not true.  You're the one who's trying to forget.
But nightmares are the common thread?
Right.  They seem to share a group delusion,  a "boogeyman" for lack of a better word.  They're so traumatized, they'll do anything not to sleep.
Call it a passion.  I've got to get going.
Well, we've got --
My mother's dead.  Died in her sleep.
Sounds like a rough time.
You want me to prescribe an experimental psychoactive drug to a bunch of suicidal teenagers?
Do you think we can get the Hypnocyl in by tomorrow?
I'll be okay.  Just give me a minute.
You're about to attend a funeral.  One that's long overdue.
Oh, it's just down the corridor on the right.
I'm a vegetarian.
And you.  I'll wait till you've gone before I tell him you're a vegetarian.
I'm sorry?  You think you deserve the brownie?
I'm delighted.
Right.  Great.  Classic.  Classic.
Hello.
You abide by rules like that?
Step aside.
No, you were brilliant
I have thought about you.
Oh no no -- no.
Would you?  It's all talk, talk, talk.
Cartwright.
My son's name is Johnny?
Brilliant.  Word perfect I'd say.
Yes -- I mean -- you never get anyone in 'Wings of a Dove' having the nerve to say 'inform the Pentagon that we need black star cover.'
Actually, Mel does his own ass work. Why wouldn't he?  It's delicious.
Okay.
What?
Who was Gilda?
That's spectacularly unfair.
Who knows, it may even help business. Buy a boring book about Egypt from the guy who screwed Anna Scott.
But... wait... there are things to say.
Yes -- I'm sorry -- I had to leave... I didn't want to disturb you.
No, don't open it yet -- I'll be embarrassed.
Yes.  The thing is... I have to go away today but I wondered, if I didn't, whether you might let me see you a bit... or, a lot maybe... see if you could... like me again.
And what would you say...
I haven't decided.
Nice one.  Would you like my phone number?
Tempting but... no, thank you.
No!
Yes, they're shifting the whole outfit much more towards the trading side -- and of course...  I was total crap.
Tony -- what do you think?
Yes, I think that one may be.
What?
Me?
Oh great.  Could you do me a favour and try to get us some really cold water up here?
No, I'm sure it'll be fine.
Well, fire away.
I did.
Right.  It's not a classic anecdotes, is it?
Can you tell her I'll ring her back.
Do you ever masturbate?
You see -- it means 'yes.'
Every time.  But don't despair -- I think I have the solution to your problems.
No, don't think I do.
Which means you won't be distracted by the fact that she's back in London, grasping her Oscar, and to be found filming most days on Hampstead Heath.
No, sir.
Well, there you go.  On for a video fest tonight?  I've got some absolute classic.
Right.  Vicious circle.  And then I was like rooting around in your things, and found this, and I thought -- cool. Kind of spacey.
So -- any messages?
Yes.
I'll talk to you in the morning.
Why not?
Fabulous.
Bad news.
So?
No, Miss Ratched...
No. Mister Harding, that is not true.
Who? Tell me!
Please use your time to familiarize yourself with your new home and if there is anything you need to know, don't hesitate to ask us.
That music is for everyone, Mister McMurphy.
On this ward?
What for?
I'm proposing a re-vote on watchin' the ballgame!
But there are eighteen patients on the ward, Mister McMurphy.
Yeah, that's kind of crazy, ain't it!
Yes, Miss Ratched...
'K-k-kay, Mack!
So long, kid.
Yeah, kid?
Soo, fare-the-weel, darlin'. I'm gone on my way, My wagons are loaded, My whip's in my hand...
C-C-Come here and l-look at th this!
Wu-wu-wu I-I-I-I th-th-think sh-sh sh-she's th-th-th-the ma-ma-ma-most bu-bu-bu-beautiful wu-wu-wu-woman in th-th-the whole world!
P-p-p-please duh-duh-duh-duh t-t tell, M-M-M-Miss R-R-Ratched, y-y you don't need to!
Let me get on your shoulders.
Charlie, ya can't ever let those goons outta ya sight! Understand!
I don't see you scoring any points, buddy. And you're just the man for the job, right?
What are you talking about??? Everybody was covered!!! Everybody was covered!!!
I said out!
When?
Can you borrow me a dime?
I'm hungry.
No.
What is it?
He is!
My, my... Ah, who are you?
Yes, well, Miss Ratched feels that you're a disturbing influence on the other patients.
Time out!
Look, miss, I don't like swallowing something without knowing what it is!
Because I quit breathing.
Yeah, you don't know how to get outta this place!
What's going on?
Oh, yeah?
Shhh!  This way!
Now, wouldn't you pray for twenty bucks, a bottle booze an' a piece of that angel cake?
Okay. How you doing?
What are they?
How's your ass been holdin' up, honey?
He can't hear you, Rose. He's just a big deaf an' dumb indian...
I don't have any.
This way, Mister McMurphy.
Who do you like in the opening game, Sam?
You're a witness, Doc!
Jus' playin' the game, sucker...
Yes, Miss Ratched!
Evenin', ma'am.
That's what I told his mother. And she said I was crazy. Her son ate the whole fucking light bulb and she said I was crazy.
Don't you sweet talk me you ol' spook, you!
Si.
Your mother.
Of course not.
Okay, ma'am, just a moment.
Once they pay the bill, we don't usually follow them.
My friend has lost her fucking mind...
My car bumper has never held a winning sticker.
Thanks.
So, this is what you do?  I mean when you're not playing other parts?
Smoking or non-smoking?
Oh, hi.  I'm an old high school buddy of Dwayne's.  I was in town this weekend, was hoping to stop by and surprise him. But I've gotta catch a plane so I'm afraid I'm not gonna be able to make it.
Right.  Thanks a lot.  And congratulations.  It's not easy finding love these days.
I'm in love with you.
NO.
Does he love you?
So it wasn't real.
Tell me.
Right now?
NO.
So were you.
Yeah...  Well, anyway, I also wanted to tell you, I'm not getting married.
Thank you.  So, since I have a few more days of vacation left, I was wondering if maybe you'd want to do something sometime.  I mean, you know, if you don't have... other plans.
Are you asking me out?
You're the reason I never met him. You knew it was the thing I most wanted in life and you sabotaged it.
If you had wanted to, you'd have gone home.
Oh, Faith.  My name's Faith.
Really...
And more...
You like shrimp?  I like shrimp.
What?
You don't have any idea?
He's a podiatrist or something.
Look how big it makes me look.  I look like an Alp.
I think it was sweet of him to pick it out.
People have problems, insecurities, flaws-- and you have to learn to compromise, to overlook, to forgive.  It's not settling, Faith, it's life.  Real life.
No...  I can just tell.
So, maybe his room hasn't been cleaned yet.  Maybe there's something in there that might help us.  Maybe they'll let us go in and take a look around.
Sorry.
Her brother.
You're right.  At least that way you could spend the rest of your life blaming your parents instead of yourself.  Smile.
Yes.  Isn't that amazing?
Is Damon Bradley here?
Uh huh...  Okay, we'll be there. How is he, anyway?
Or maybe it'll turn him back into a toad.
So.  I guess I've got a wedding to go to.
This is your most lucky day.  My family runs a pension not three blocks from here.
What?  You know him?
And you didn't tell her?
She's not here.
Gimme.
What do you want me to do, Johnny?
But my own kid bro—
In a minute.
It's a living.
Let me explain you something, kid. Stooling is when you rat on your friends, on the guys you're with.  When Johnny needs a favor, don't try to figure it out, just do it. Now go ahead, join the congregation.
Nothing ever stops you from talking, Charley.
I don't know— I don't know! I tell you I ain't made up my mind yet. That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
What do you weigh these days, slugger?
Tommy, what happened?
Give it to me— my Pop's job—
I'll get home all right now.
What did that man mean when he said you were... .?
I better get home.
It's a regular college. It's just run by the nuns. The Sisters of St. Anne.
How would you've done it?
That's my own flock up there, getting their evening workout. I won plenty of races with 'em.  Listen, you want to see them? Come up on the roof with me and I'll show 'em to you.
I only live up there and across the roof.
Come on, I know a quiet one, with a special entrance for ladies... .
Hit me again, Mac.
I went pretty good for a while, didn't I, Al? But— I didn't stay in shape— and—  —I had to take a few dives.
Shouldn't we care about everybody?
Want to hear my philosophy? Do it to him before he does it to you.
And when things get in your way— or people —you just knock them aside— get rid of Them— is that your idea?
His— racket?
But a priest...?
Edie, down here it's every man for himself. It's keepin' alive! It's standin' in with the right people so you can keep a little loose change jinglin' in your pocket.
It was Johnny Friendly who killed Joey, wasn't it?
Much more, Terry. Much, much more!
I— I brought this for you, Terry. It was Joey's.  Yours is coming out at the elbows.
Go ahead, wear it.
There's a hawk around. They're scared tonight.
I don't want to hurt Charley— I don't want to hurt you...
It's you who's being hurt. By keeping it inside you, like a poison. Sooner or later it's got to come out.
I keep hearing it and I don't know what to do..I don't know what to do... .
Edie, Edie, I...
Pop, I'm not ready to go back yet.
Who is he! Edie, you're so softhearted and soft-headed you wouldn't recognize the devil if he had you by the throat. You know who this Terry Malloy is? The kid brother of Charlie the Gent, Johnny Friendly's right hand, a butcher in a camel hair coat.
Are you trying to tell me Terry is too?
I don't get it!
What are you going to do?
Your gun.
What did you say?
But you still hold out for silence?
Our identification.
You sure looked it. Something go wrong?
I'm just resting my feet.
Yeah?
Looping right! I never swung wild. I was strictly a short puncher— hooks— over 'n under—  — whop-whop!
You was a Golden Warrior.
Listen, kid, why don't you go home before Johnny... .
Don't hit me, now, don't hit me!
It's good for you. Develops your mind.
Naw, thanks, Johnny, I don't want it, I—
It was a big nothing! The Father did all the talking.
He don't, huh?  Well, he knows thirty-nine pages worth of our operation.
Look who says bum!
Fiend is it!  You will not be so fortunate.  Your existence will cease within moments.  No one wishes to see a man dance...  And you, my dear, will entertain for centuries to come.
You wouldn't understand.  Seeing a cemetery on a night like this can stir in the mind the best ideas for a good horror story.
But there're so many wonderful things to write about, Bob.
Sure there are--and I've tried them all.  Plays, love stories, westerns, dog stories.  Huh, now there was a good one, that dog story all about--
What help will that do if something in there isn't dead?
Well, it's probably just the caretaker, and that's exactly who we want to find.  They'll have a telephone.  C'mon.
Don't let them hear you.
<i>Him!</i>  I'll bet he sleeps with all the lights on.
There's nothing to forgive. It was all a dream.
It would seem so, Master.
Your own pleasure comes only after mine, when I desire it. I am the Sole Ruler of the Dark World.  There is no one to challenge my authority here. My word is the law--all powerful. <b>No one</b> is to challenge that authority, <b>no one!</b>.  Is that understood?  It is my command.
There is yet time.  Don't you want your own pleasure?
All others were but infinitessimal bits of fluff, compared to <i>her</i>  This one would have <i>died</i> for feathers, furs, and fluff...and so she did!
For what!?!
Live ones where only the dead should be?
We don't know of anything, Master...
Then why do you shake so?
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.
I can't remember doing anything wrong either.
Till it's not funny any more.  What do you want, Jack?
And the one driving the other car?
Who is it?
Yes.
Really.  Hm.
Till they got busted.
There's a store around the corner, I'll be right back.
You'll have to ask Glenn.  And most likely, he's on his way to Detroit, where we should be.
Well, first off, if you were Glenn, you wouldn't be thinking.
What's he do now, tell fortunes?
How long you talk to her?
Jesus, look at that wall.  Place almost looks like a prison.
Time comes, we knock on the door.  See if he wants to talk about old times. Go in the easy way.
My sister believes in fate, but not hell.  That's why she stopped praying for the lost souls since you don't hear that much about purgatory anymore. But every day she asks her boss to pray I don't fuck up.  Whatta you think, you think there's a hell, Jack?
Yeah, it's called Glades Correctional Institution and I'm sure as shit not going back there or any place like it.
You find out?
Yeah, I did.
Half for doing what?
Yeah, hi.  Nice house.
What'd you talk about?
Yeah, but I had enough reason to believe he did, and I told you.  So you had to at least suspect him.
The time came, you shot him.  But you didn't shoot Foley or the guy with him.  They're unarmed, you had a shotgun and you let them throw you in the trunk. Okay, now you got your Sig in your hand.  You say in the report you couldn't turn around, he had you pinned down.  But when the trunk opened, how come you didn't cap the two guys then?
You say in the report Glenn didn't have a gun, but you let him get away, too.
You'll have to ask him.
What-- we already talked to her.  That's a dead end.
Yeah, I know.  I was just leaving. Why were you trying to reach me?
Yeah, why?
Wait.  You not Adele?
If you move, if you look at her again, you're dead.
Yeah, but I see you moved it up.
Dude in the dress is Eddie Solomon, used to buy scag off a corner till he kicked it and found his happiness with crack and then started dealing himself. Word on the street was he was saving up for an operation.
Yeah, and, as you can see, home invasions are big, too.
Guy named Maurice Miller, also known as Snoopy, a former prizefighter.
Yeah.
Company, shit.  I watch the man's back.
It seems to me I been reading about you in the newspaper.  Busted out of some joint in Florida, huh?
Let's go outside and talk.
What's the matter with right here? It's nice and warm.
Give me a minute, talk to Buddy.
Break and enter, shit.  Take it and git, how it's done.  Don't waste any time.  That's how you do it.
Not until recently.
You devil, it's mace, huh?  What've you got here, a billy?  Use it on poor unfortunate offenders.
You were married?  All those falls, I'm surprised you had time.
It was May, 1934, near Gibsland, Louisiana.
And the guy saying he wasn't gonna take any more shit from anybody...
Yeah, right.  Anyway, that scene where Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway get shot?  I remember thinking at the time it wouldn't be a bad way to go, if you have to.
Nothing.
Yeah...
Shit...
None of your business.
Why not?
Because you're having too much fun.
Is that how you think of yourself?
What, as a sales rep?
I had one just like it -- well, it was the same idea, but I had to get rid of it.
You did?
Having it cleaned didn't help, huh?
Well, does it make sense to you?
You waved to me in the elevator.
So she did help you?
I'm just going to the bathroom.
I don't know.
You know what I mean.
How many?
I hear six.
You know who they are?
Really?
Plus, even it was true, he'd still have to figure out where I keep 'em.
First, I'm goin' to Israel for a year, study the Talmud, work on a Kibbutz... then come back, maybe take some tennis lessons.
Oh, yeah, I'm calm.  In fact, I'm totally "relaxed..."
Maurice?  From Lompoc?  Good God.
Meaning?
It couldn't have been out at Glades, if that's what you're thinking.  I was never out there.
I remember you now.  Shit.
Jesus.  How'd you know about Snoopy?
Yeah, the plan was to pick him up at his office tomorrow, take him out to his house in Bloomfield Hills.  Now, I don't give a shit what they do.
He's supposed to be, but he hasn't shown up yet, which is a good thing for him.
I'm freezing my ass off.
But listen, Glenn.  If you're lying to me...
Gimme another hint.
Oh, I'm here, all right.  I'm very here. Question is, why aren't <u>you</u> here?
Look, Glenn, I know you cool, but you don't have to give me no tone of voice, okay?  You don't like what I'm saying, you can get out anywhere along here you want.
Yeah, Kenneth, why you have to do that to that poor girl.
Great.  We got one of 'em.
You're not my type.
Something better.  Open it.
--Sig-Sauer .38.  I love it.
Which one is that?  The ATF guy?
Hello?
Foley <i>kid</i>napped me.
He doesn't seem to hold a grudge.  What <i>I</i> want to know is why, they got such a big score up north, did Foley hang around Miami for so long?  Any thoughts on that one?
He's in Florida.  Palm Beach.
When's he due back?
Where the fuck is Foley?
If Evelyn's here, the rest are here!
You know the football player, Red G- Grange?  Well the guys called me R-Red, cause you know, I'm red...and they thought I was strange, so, you know, Red G-Grange, Red Str-Strange.
Yes Sir.
You'll love it.  No base, no bars, just lots of sun and aircraft maintenance.
What lizard?
What's there?
Home of the brave.
What color flowers you want me to bring to your funeral?
And I'm on yours.  Land of the free.
Were.  Isn't that what you mean?  Were. Because he's dead, isn't he?  And that's why you've come.
He said you're the only one he ever saw who was better in the air than him.
We got some soldiers in traction from a jeep accident, but it's quiet.  Except for the occasional fighter plane buzzing us.
He told me he didn't want to leave me with regret.  Now that's all I have.
No baseball diamonds, Red.
Thank you, Sir.
Every other Sunday.  I'm heavyweight champion of the West Virginia.
What do you get for winning?
Tell me something, Dorie.  A man as big as you -- and smart too, you knew where to come when your ship couldn't help -- do you still have to fight with your fists to get respect?
You too, 'Mam.
I was hoping to meet him.
I'm going to the war.  The real war. Hitler's taken Europe.  The Brits are hanging on by their fingernails, and If they lose, there'll be more people killed than anybody can imagine.  And not just there, but here.
There's nothing you can do here, they'll die or they won't, we just --
Rafe... No.  You forgive me.
It must of been a convincing letter.
It was.  I couldn't have you go away, wherever it is...to war...without knowing something.  You think I made a choice, of Danny over you.  I didn't.  I didn't have a choice.  I'm pregnant.
I have arranged a live fire drill -- with your permission.
Set up teams of radio operators to send out messages the Americans will intercept, concerning every potential American target in the Pacific.  Include Hawaii -- the clutter will be more confusing that way.
All of 'em.
Learn English, then!
The Council knows I have opposed fighting the Americans.  No matter how great our resolve, they have resources beyond ours. If we must go to war, there is only one way -- deal them a blow from which it will take them years to recover.  In that time we can conquer all of the Pacific, and they will have no choice but to ask for peace.
It's her 18th birthday, I want to show her off.
I'd take better care of my teeth.
It wouldn't be a lodge without hats.
It looks great. Don't change the subject. You know how busy Saturdays are. And I can't do the icing. I always mess up the roses. You're not being very responsible.
Borrow?! This was my dress.  Maybe it's a mistake. What if I'm the only one? I don't even want to go. Everybody's just going to say...  Hi.. Where's Crazy Charlie?
Why are you so nervous? What is the matter with you today?
Come on. What's with you and Michael?
Michael Fitzsimmons! Is he here?
Don't say that...
No. You are the undead. You will live forever if you give me your Twinkie.  Come on, let's have it. You hate them anyway.
Maybe I blocked it out.
Thanks.
Yeah I know.  But I don't have to flatter you.  It just feels right. You're the perfect girl for me.  As in is, was and always will be.  I'm glad dancing was invented.  You know the first dances were rituals. Like fertility rites.
Save it.
What about everything I said to you this afternoon...
But what has to be different?
I was at Lena's last night. You were terrific.
If you took the trouble to write it, then sure, I'll take a look at it. But I'm beginning to think that maybe there's more to life than music. I wonder if people would still like me if I stopped being Mr. Excitement?
I know.
But I love you. I'll love you forever.
Hello, sir. How are things at the hat store?
What would that be, sir?
Oh! You did that on purpose! I hate you. Go gargle with razor blades!
What if we're witnessing the end of touch dancing?
My children make me happy. I miss them so much.  Beth. Scott and Beth.  I'm going to name my daughter after you.
I wish I had the nerve. And the figure.
Gilfond's okay, except he thinks Hemingway's great Literature.
Yeah. I'm surprised. It's really old...  Travels well though.  You know, the world looks a lot better from up here.
Is that one of your poems?
Okay. Here's a new one. It's called Tenderness.  I couldn't sleep so I thought I'd scream Betrayed by a kiss, sucking pods of bitterness. In the madhouse of Dr. Dread Razor shreds of rat puke fall On my bare arms  I'm sorry. I guess I was trying to impress you. 
Yes. We had a glorious night together. One day you'll remember and write about it.
Peggy Sue's still stuck on treble without a cause.
At my age? Don't be silly.
That's your problems The more women think, the more trouble they get into.
Evelyn, take her to her room!
Kennedy's a Catholic. He'll never win.
Sort of.
Sure, Mom.  Hello.
I'm confused about a lot of things right now. Charlie's only one of them.
I'm just happy to see you.
Don't eat the red ones.
Of course, he'll love it. You're a terrific artist.
I just did it for tonight. I don't normally dress like this.
Gee. I'm sorry to hear that.
Well, you showed them. You're rich and famous and successful. And you have a beautiful wife.
You know, I never told anybody this, but I always had a feeling that when you die, before you go to heaven, you get a chance to fly around high school for a while.
It really wasn't that difficult.
It's not that. Can we meet after school? Please?
How, did you know about my grandfather?
You're giving me the creeps.
Good. You're discreet. I like that in a partner.
What are you talking about?
That's what you were talking about yesterday? Everybody does that in the future?
No offense, but you're pretty out of it now.
We were lying in the sand. It was my eighteenth birthday... We were so awkward... I would have married him anyway...
Oh, go feel up your hamsters! I hear rodents put out.
There are three more girls where that one came from looking for homes.
God damn it Gus, you dug up my wife! What the fuck is going on around here?!
Oh, you know... drink beer, tell ghost stories. They try and spook each other out, talking about zombies and things...  It's no big deal, Chase. I did it when I was young.
Nothing. I just got spooked by a bunch of furballs.
I'll be fine, Dad.
I still can't believe she's dead...
He did. We buried him.  There's a place out in the woods... if you bury something there, it comes back alive.
I'm not trying to prove anything.  I was burying my dog.
I came back for you, Geoff. We're going to be together again.
You'll never find it in the dark.
Allright. Calm down.
What's that on your forehead, pal?
You're not smiling.
That's right. We're on the Positive Plan. You don't have a Fatal Disease, you have Manageable Illness.
Then, what <u>are</u> we, Drew?! The <u>winners</u>? "Ladies and gentlemen, the first prize of AIDS goes to Andrew Beckett and his lover Miguel..." Excuse me, I'm not your lover. I'm your Care Partner. FUCK!
About my blood work?
I know what it means. Your Honor, imagine how the children in this neighborhood have been made to feel. The pounding of construction ringing in their ears as this skyscraper, a tribute to mankind's greed, grows daily, casting an ominous shadow over their lives, filling them with dread even as they are surrounded in a black, toxic fog, blocking out the sun while poisoning their lungs! And Counselor calls it harmless?!
Okay, okay... They discover you have this horrible, disgusting, terminal illness, and they panic, for any number of perfectly valid reasons. They're frightened for themselves, their families... Maybe it's the homo angle. Maybe they don't want to rub elbows with someone who's just popped out of the closet with a terminal case of acne. And how do they explain your status to the client for Chrissake?
Don't send flowers, Joe. I'm not dead yet.
Arline decision. Supreme Court.
What have you prayed for?
I've made provisions in my will for some charities. Miguel will need a lawyer. I know it's not your area...
Want to hear my favorite aria?
Opera?
If it please the court, I'd like to ask Mr. Beckett to remove his shirt, so that the jury can have an <u>accurate</u> idea of what we're talking about.
Catch me later, I'll be here. And tell Amy, I love her painting, it's on my wall.
Do you take risks?
Were you aware in 1984 or 1985 that there was a fatal disease out there, called AIDS, and that you could contract it through sexual activity?
Really?
Absolutely.
Your earrings?
I said my earrings <u>are</u> American. They're African-American.
I'm not worried. What are you doing?
Or unprotected sex with someone you didn't know very well, any time during the last twelve years.
We won.
It satisfied me.
But he's got lots of other people's lives to ruin...
Aren't you?
Lisa, c'mon. One guy sticking his dick in another guy's mouth? It's disgusting.
Like firing Andrew Beckett taught <u>him</u> a lesson?
Joseph Miller, Your Honor. Macready and Shilts Legal Services.
Your Honor? May I have ten minutes in re-direct?
Holy Shit. Did you, Bob?
You have to make a decision: is this guy partner material?
What about other homosexual facilities, whatever they are?
Charles...
He was doing a great job.
No matter how hard I try, I can't lose a file in my computer.
Lookit. Lookit!
He died fast. And if we got any choice, that's the way we should all go out.  Don't you cry for Johns. Don't you dare.
<u>What</u>?
Oh, sure. Why not? Sounds like a hoot.
Well, is someone coming for us? Or are we all just gonna die of exposure or dehydration or sunstroke or maybe even something worse?  Hey, you don't have to worry about scaring me.
'Mean the whispers?
An' now you're worried about a repeat of history?
Entered our minds.
Audrey?
Riddick? How close?
<u>I trusted you</u>, Riddick. Goddamn, I trusted that some part of you wanted to rejoin the human race.
Cargo hold, everyone in the cargo hold. lesgo, lesgo, lesgo.
I think I twisted my ankle running backwards like that. And I'm not sure I can....  Okay, that's a lie. I just don't want to be alone back there anymore. If you could just give me a few minutes up front here --
Carolyn Fry. I'd shake hands, but...
What'd Owens mean? 'Bout not touching the switch?
You said it, not me. Let's just not let one bad call lead to another.
15 6-gigs here...90 gigs total...other ship carries 20-gig cells, so...five. Five total to launch.
60 years ago.
-- we need a fail-safe. Bring the cells over at the last possible minute -- when the wings are ready, when we <u>know</u> we're ready to launch.
Not a problem unless you're gonna make --
Oh, don't use her like that, for a smoke screen.
Smoke screen for what?
79 kilos.
You give him the cells and the ship -- and he will leave you. He will leave you all out there to die.
Somethin' knocked us off-lane. Maybe a rogue comet. Maybe we'll never know.
You hear me? Captain's dead. Owens too.
Some prophet guy?
We're all on the same hajj now.
Which half?
Think a soul could get lost there? With all those pilgrim-types?
Well, what's it look like now?
No. She's not.
What if you're one of five?
Kept calling it "murder" when I did it.
Either way, figure it's something you can grab onto.
What, it's broken?
Certainly, sir. I'll get my notes and come right over.
Did you forget our appointment, Cornelius?
It wasn't difficult. Only an apostate or a lunatic would flee to the Forbidden Zone.  I see you brought along the female of your species.  I didn't realize a man could be monogamous.
Don't speak to me in absolutes. The evidence is contestable.
To begin with, your methods of dating the past are crude, to say the least. There are geologists on my staff who would laugh at your speculations.
No sir, I haven't forgotten.
That's correct. And you will both stand trial for heresy.
Zira, are you trying to get my head cut off?
It's probably wrong --
Any sign of dangerous ionization?
Any particular reason?
None at all.
You're more than three hundred light years from your precious planet. Your loved ones have been dead and forgotten for twenty centuries. Even if you could get back, they'd think you were something that fell out of a tree.
The foundations of scientific brain surgery are being laid right here - in studies of cerebral function in these animals.
No change. The minute you open the door, he goes into his act.
See? He keeps pretending he can talk.
He's trying to form words.
Well, you know what they say. Human see, human do.
Air leak. Died in her sleep.
Don't bother
I'd like to know why not. You thought life on Earth was meaningless. You despised people. So what did you do? You ran away.
Let's take a look.
Try telling them our names.
I'm for that.
Always giving orders. Just like every other adult.
Relax. You'll see it all later.
I think you're making a mistake.
Why special?
Bailiff! Stop this outburst! Gag that monstrosity!
With one of them.
Identify him, then. Speak to him.
A fort! Unconsciously, you chose a name that was belligerent.  Where were you nurtured?
Twelve hundred years ago.
Cease fire! Withdraw!
Second from the left.
Mr. President, I believe the Prosecutor has reassembled all he surviving humans captured in the hunt along with Bright Eyes.
What?
Don't tell me how to fight this fucking war, 'Lias, you go crying to fucking brigade on your time. Out here you belong to me. Now move.
Yeah, what is it?
...everybody gotta die sometime Red... Get back to your foxhole.
That reminds me, I gotta take a shit.
Yeah if you let me have your shirt.
Yeah but I still like a piece of pussy once in a while - ain't nothing like a piece of pussy cept maybe the Indie 500.
Then the worm has definately turned for you man.
She was a crossbreed, Chinese and Polish.
Barnes believes in what he's doing.
Nah...
So what am I going to do! Get one of my guys zapped so some fuckface fresh from the World can get his beauty fucking sleep!
Knock it off! We got two men need attention here. Police up your extra ammo and frags, don't leave nothing for the dinks. Hoyt, Junior, carry Gardner.
Yeah, you done said it. Revenge on US.
These two holes are yours...
I'm afraid there's nothing I can do about it, Mr. Mitchell.
I really don't know.
I don't know.
You don't know.
Suppose I hadn't known that immigration inspector? Hadn't put in a good word for you?
Okay. You win.
Disgusting, aren't they? If you really want a Martini, I know where you can get one.
I don't need it that badly. I don't enjoy crashing other people's parties.
I can be talked out of it. As a matter of fact, I'd like a dry Martini myself.
He got in here how?
It's always a mistake to run away. Always.
Dance? Tonight?
At this time of night. It's not as bad as it looks.
Why?
No use waiting, then.
How bad is the other thing?  The secret?
And Betty Mayfield--
It's the frame on the picture. But not if you say so.
Including Killaine.
So could you.  But our records were a little against us.
Not this one.  And not Mitchell.
Don't go soft on me, baby.  I've got your note in my pocket.  You wrote it, all by your own self. And I have to use it.  It has to be found in exactly the right place.
And that nasty man that followed us last night.  You didn't kill him.
You think Magruder wants to hang beside me?
Yes.  You.  You're not really a murderer yet.
Do you think I was faking?
I'd like a dry Martini. Very dry, please.
I'll have to know a little more than that.
Miss Mayfield, the humor of the situation escapes me. Within 24 hours I shall know officially whether Mitchell was murdered. Privately, I'm quite sure of it now. It happened in your room, and you came to Vancouver with him.. At any rate, he made your hotel reservation.. And you arrived together. Here in this room he behaved nastily to you, and you said something to him which might be taken as a threat.  A few hours later he was found dead on your balcony. Would it be too much too suggest that all these circumstances taken together are a little suspicious?
It is?
Deep blue? I'd call it grey-blue.
We wouldn't have met at all.
But not in the investigation of a major crime, I hope.
Then there isn't much I can do, is there?
Points very straight to her.
What does he see?
Not quiet yet.  We know who the gun belonged to. Margo West.  She told us this morning.  It doesn't mean much.  Mitchell took it away from her.  He had a habit of going through her bag.
Because you think your in love with me?
To do what?
You do things the hard way, don't you?
Not sometimes.  Always.  Just because it is the hard way.  You're that kind of man, Jeff.
This way.
You guessed it. The card's phony. I got plenty of 'em. Different names, different jobs. I work out of San Francisco. Go anywhere, do anything. All it takes is the folding.
Mayfield? Oh, that girl you were with last night. You haven't hired me yet. Mr. Brandon.
They still hang women in Canada, I've heard.
I've got good ears.
I wouldn't know.
Could we discuss that some other time?
Now and then.  Mostly just for the fun of it.
Mr. Mitchell.
Or--since one is a well-known and respected guest--one could go to the desk in the lobby and say "Miss Mayfield seems to have lost her room key--have you another"?  They always have another.
That's not enough.
I saw your face this evening when the detective showed you the gun. You lied. It was obvious.
You could have got in that room, just as you got in here. How do I know you didn't kill Larry?
With what motive?
Thank you. It is rather late... and I'm not young anymore. Good night.
I understand.  Pity to mess up a nice clean boat.
Magruder's conked out.  Adrenaline injections, oxygen tent.  He may come out of it and he may not.  As a source of quick information, we can't forget him.
I guess I'm just ballast around here.
I've got to find a way to handle it, openly.  Like Brandon.
Did we ever really think it was suicide?
You win, Inspector.  You win all along the line.  Why didn't we think of Brandon before--or did we-- some of us.  Yeah.  Of course you did.  When a suspect thinks he's safe, you go on letting him think he's safe. Wait for a mistake.
I shall. From your knowledge of Mitchell, would you say he would be likely to commit suicide?
How did you know?  Clarendon.  You cops never tell anybody anything, do you.
At first, it doesn't hurt at all. That's shock.  Then it hurts terribly--you wouldn't believe such pain could exist--and six months later you can't remember what pain felt like.  It hasn't taken six months this time.  It hasn't even taken twenty- four hours.  Is that a beastly thing to say?
I'll investigate Mr. Clarendon's financial position--
Perhaps a rich widow would have solved all his problems.
I'll take your word.
Identification on possible, Sir. Not conclusive.
Nor I. This is why I gave it to you.
Who's the girl?
You don't have to make a pose of it.
I told you she's just..
In an hour, Larry.
He was delightful.
Yes.
Good.  Suez was a minefield for both parties.
If you like.  But don't be too modest, James.  The citizen's duty is to remember, not necessarily to write books.  You are highly qualified.  You're a responsible journalist doing what sounds to me like a very demanding job.  Every day you take decisions that depend on your sense of history.  A genuine tyranny would have to get rid of people like you.
You're kind to be so encouraging.
Well, I'd hate to be a nuisance.
Did he?  I left school and worked for the Labour Party.  My older brother, George, had just been killed in Greece, and he'd been an active member.  I hero-worshipped him.  He was 25 years old ...  It was an exciting time for us, those first couple of years after the war.  We thought the country was about to become a true democracy.  I can understand why people of your generation want to write about that time.  They feel betrayed.  They want to know what went wrong.
I'm not sure I can face it.
Good.
Like I was saying, the American angle in Suez is very important. I wouldn't want to say they let us down.  I think that's wrong.  A good ally is one who doesn't back you up in your mistakes, who tells you when to pull back.  And the Americans were good allies.  Simple as that.
That's her.
Too bad.  What did your father do?
I think you're exaggerating.  And if you aren't, you should jolly well change your job.
I called you a taxi.
No jokes.  James is in love.
To the Fleet.
And the Argies.
Jeremy, just let me see what you've got.
Let me see.
You've really got it all worked out, haven't you?
Fuck off.
I've known Susan for more than fifteen years.  James, we're old allies.
Suez.  1956.
What about the Cromwells?
The bed's all made up if you want to stay.
Well, it's worth seeing.
U-huh.
You'd look naked without one.
Promise?
It's true!  I was here last year doing a piece, remember?  I was in the bar with all these Northern trade unionists and their sponsored MPs.  They were all incredibly fat and beery, huge trousers and braces. And so sweet.  They all stood round me like children saying 'You! Working for television?  You're just a young thing.'  They wouldn't let me buy drinks even when I told them the programme was paying. They kept looking at my pass which was pinned here and saying  'Oo, can I?'
No, Bells Beach, Australia.
News, last night... those guys, the Ex-Presidents... they robbed my bank yesterday.  And I was just there the day before, cashing a check.  See... look.  Assured Trust... same place.
Yeah, I noticed you limping.  But don't worry about it, brah. Don't worry at all.  We're not gonna land on land!
You do it... you first!
You first!
And let my policy expire?  Sorry.
Naw, you pull it!
Look, I don't know anything about your dog, okay--
Well is there anyone else here that might have seen him?
I take the skin off chicken.
Welcome to Sea World, kid.
Reagan usually drives.  Stolen switch car, they leave it running at the curb, looks parked from a distance.  When they run, they dump the vehicle and vanish.  And I mean vanish.
You watch your fucking mouth!  Mr. Hoover himself pinned the Seal of Honor right here!
The lab made three possible matches, this was one of 'em.
Thanks for the tip.  I needed this knowledge.
Nice tattoo, Dietz.
Cute.  He was inside for about 20 minutes.  The other guy, Roach, waited in the truck.  They were scoping it out, right?!
Wait, wait.  Then these guys go back to their beach house and box up all their shit.  Load it in Bodhi's truck and take it to a public storage unit.  You see?  Summer's almost over.  They're splitting. They're gonna pick up a little traveling money tomorrow.  The next day at the outside latest.  I got a feeling.
Wait, so I'm a big hero to my folks, right?  But two years ago they got killed in a car wreck and I just suddenly realized all my goals had been their goals.  And I hadn't been living my own life.  So I wanted something for myself.  Something that maybe didn't make any sense.  You know what I mean?
Meaning you were expendable.
You're kneeling on my hand.
No way, old buddy.
You never were all that smart... let's go!!!
That's right, I set you up. You're a veteran at this, Dutch, I had to.
You know you can't win this one.
We both got scores to settle.
I saw it.
We figure we've got less than twenty-four hours to catch up with them. After that, there's not much hope. We want a rescue operation mounted tonight. That doesn't give you much time.
Twenty-five percent.
You're not getting any navy contracts.
Huh?  Oh... yeah.  S'okay?  Uhm... how're... business things going.
Not with those smokestacks it's not.
No.  What I have is a lot of money.
You're making the right decision, sir.
Uh, no.  How do I get to Beverly Hills?
No.
What do you want it to be?  Vivian, my name's Vivian.
Edward... you got it!
You may feel more comfortable. This is not the kind of place that rents rooms by the hour.
Off the boulevard.
Tsk.  Excuse me, I didn't think he had change for a hundred.
They should be.  They're both good at it.
Just a romantic, that's you.
Yeah.  Too good.  I forgot where I was.
This isn't a date.
I thought I told you not to answer the phone.
I had a little problem in one store.  I wasn't dressed right. I don't know what to say.  I don't belong there.  Maybe I'll just go back to Bridget.  She was cool.
He died a long time ago.
I thought I was the pro.  These women make me feel like an amateur.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I've been with stinking old men who've made me want to puke but I've never had anyone make me feel as dirty as you did tonight.
But don't they have it in English?
I more than liked it.
Oh, god, what?
I know a lot of nice girls.
Industrial espionage is not ridiculous.  Edward, how do you know she hasn't attached herself to you so she can bring Kross back information?
Hi, Viv.  Carlos, you know my roommate, Viv.
Okay.  I'm sorry I said your dream was stupid.
Hey, hey -- There's a rent.
Kit!  Where've you been?
Hey Kit, where do I go for the clothes?  Good stuff on <u>him</u>.
Get a job and probably go back to school.  Figure out what I'm gonna be.
Rent.  You're late.
I also place las chocolates on the pillow.
You're a guest here?
That's all right.  I'm sure they're quite lovely.
I think you'll find it normal enough.
Professionally?
May I live a thousand years and never hunt again.
Then why is there fear behind your eyes?
You can die slowly cut into a thousand pieces.
But what if something happens to you?
Death cannot stop true love. All it can do is delay it for a while.
We face each other as God intended. Sportsmanlike. No tricks, no weapons, skill against skill alone.
It's not my fault being the biggest and the strongest. I don't even exercise. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           38.
Well, I haven't fought just one person for so long. I've been specializing in groups. Battling gangs for local charities, that kind of thing.
Don't say that, Vizzini. Please.
True!
Yeah?
I have a little.
Has it been fifteen minutes?
At Miracle Max's. It fit so nice, he said I could keep it.
Well, I wasn't nervous.
Yes.
Who kills Prince Humperdinck? At the end, somebody's got to do it. Is it Inigo? Who?
No, it's kissing again. You don't want to hear it.
Okay.
Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. So long. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          124.
The Thieves' Forest is emptied. Thirty men guard the castle gate.
I give you full marks for bravery --don't make yourself a fool.
It will not happen!
I don't think I'm quite familiar with that phrase.
Of course.
Tyrone, you know how much I love watching you work. But, I've got my country's five hundredth anniversary to plan, my wedding to arrange, My wife to murder, and Guilder to frame for it. I'm swamped. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           75.
Let me explain --  -- No, there is too much. Let me sum up.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           99.
I WANT MY FATHER BACK, YOU SON- OFA-BITCH!
We're really in a terrible rush.
Don't rush me, sonny. You rush a miracle man, you get rotten miracles. You got money?
Your first story was better.  Where's that bellows?  He probably owes you money, huh? Well, I'll ask him.
Look who knows so much. Well, it just so happens that your friend here is only mostly dead. There's a big difference between mostly dead and all dead. Please open his mouth.
That is a noble cause. Give me the sixty-five, I'm on the job.
Nothing comes to mind.
You've done nothing but study swordplay?
Well, it's the only way I can be satisfied. If I use my right -- tch -- over too quickly.
-- there's nothing to explain. You're trying to kidnap what I've rightfully stolen. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           43.
You've made your decision then7
I'll tell you in a minute. First, let's drink -- me from my glass, and you from yours.
You only think I guessed wrong --  -- that's what's so funny! I switched glasses when your back was turned. You fool.
What?
Yes.  Dopey show-girls in gooey gowns.  Two-three-kick-turn!  Turn- turn-kick-turn!  It's enough to make you throw up!  At last a chance to do straight drama!  To deal with conflict, with inner truth.  Roger De Bris presents history.  Of course, I think we should add a little music.  That whole third act has got to go. They're losing the war.  It's too depressing.  We'll have to put something in there.  Aaahghhh!  I see it!  A line of beautiful girls, dressed as Storm Troopers, black patent leather boots, all marching together... Two-three-kick-turn!  Turn-turn- kick-turn!
How do you do.  I mean ... Excuse me ... I mean ...
Shut up.  I'm having a rhetorical conversation.  How humiliating.  Max Bialystock. Max Bialystock.
I have hurt your feelings.
In looking at your books, I've discovered that ...
Twenty-eight seconds, hurry, hurry, you're using up your time.
Where?  What?
Yes, it's quite possible.
What do you mean?
What did I do?
But what if the play was a hit?
Bloom, worlds are turned on such thoughts!
Mr. Bialystock, not more than five minutes ago, against my better judgment, I doctored your books. That, sir, is the ultimate extent of my criminal life.
Aaaaaaaaaa!
Go away from me.  You frighten me.  Sit over there.
That's very kind of you, Mr. Bialystock, but I ...
Maybe you're happy.
What is she gonna do here?
Watch closely, as Bialystock drives the last nail into the coffin.
No way out.  No way out.  What?  Who?
It was the same thing in Germany. We looked for years before we found the right Hitler.
Franz, don't you see, Hitler was a man of his time.  This is a man of his time.
I'm not crazy.  I'm inept.
You mean out of business.  Heh, heh.
Of course I need you.  It's dark in there.
Got dag pa dig.
No!  No!  We don't make love.  Go to work.
Here I come, ready or not.
Oh, I'd better hurry back.  I don't want to miss one minute of it.
Vat?
What have you done, LSD?
What do you do best?
Hey, baby, that's good!  How'd we come out?
Look at the picture. Please.
She was tired. She said she had a long drive ahead of her, in the morning... Yes, now I'm remembering very clearly because I'm picturing. When you make a picture of the moment in your mind, you can remember every detail. She was sitting back there, no she was standing up, with some sandwich still in her hand, and she said she had to drive a long way.
Back where?
Cash or check? For the cabin...
Not at all!
No! Just no!  I have one of those breaking points like any other man, believe it or not, and I'm near it. There's just so much pushing I can take and I think...
Can I trade in my car and take another?
You better run out to the house. She may be... unable to answer the phone...
How'd you and this detective come to trace her to Fairvale?
With the forty thousand dollars?
Like what?
Sorry I got you up, boy. Go back to sleep. Yeah, be glad to.  Said to give you his regards.
I want to know if my sister is here.
What's the matter?
A good reason, I suppose.
What do you know about it?
Nothing! You're putting me on the defensive.
No.
I didn't see her... and I didn't hear from her! Believe that!
She'll need both of us.
Where... can I stay?
You have an awfully nice habit, Sam.
Yes.
You'll never find it.
Contemplate your... panic button.
Well?
You're not.
We were going to get married. Are going to get married!
I know.  Do you think if something happened, it happened there?
How could we prove...  Well, if he opens a new motel on the new highway... say, a year from now...
I could stand something regular.
For what?
This! Meeting you in secret so we can be... secretive! You come down here on business trips and we steal lunch hours and... I wish you wouldn't even come.
I can come down next week.
Sam! No!
I pay, too. They also pay who meet in hotel rooms.
A couple of years and the debts will be paid off. And if she ever re- marries, the alimony stops... and then...
I'm thinking of it.
Hey, we can leave together can't we?
You have a vacancy?
You shouldn't have bothered. I really don't have that much of an appetite.
Don't worry about it.  But as long as you've made us supper, we may as well eat it. Huh?
Not really. I hear that expression, that one eats "like a bird," is really a falsie, I mean a falsity, because birds eat a tremendous lot.  Oh, I don't know anything about birds. My hobby is stuffing things... taxidermy. And I guess I'd just rather stuff birds because...  well, I hate the look of beasts when they're stuffed, foxes and chimps and all... some people even stuff dogs and cats... but I can't... I think only birds look well stuffed because they're rather...  passive, to begin with... most of them...
Is your time so empty?
What are you running away from?
No. People never run away from anything.  The rain didn't last very long.  You know what I think? I think we're all in our private traps, clamped in them, and none of us can ever climb out. We scratch and claw... but only at the air, only at each other, and for all of it, we never budge an inch.
Oh I do... but I say I don't. 
A son is a poor substitute for a lover. 
What do you mean about caring?  Have you ever seen one of those places? Inside? Laughing and tears and cruel eyes studying you... and my mother there?  Why? has she harmed you? She's as harmless as... one of these stuffed birds.
Then I'm free to go...?
Norman took a wife?
He told you he wasn't coming right back cause he wanted to question Norman Bates' mother, right?
I always thought it was the people who are alone so much who do all the talking when they get the chance. Yet there you are, doing all the listening!  You are alone here, aren't you?  It would drive me crazy.
And now that your mother's dead?
Buy a new one! In a new town! Where you won't have to hide your mother!
Mother, she's just a stranger!  As if men don't desire strangers, as if... oh, I refuse to speak of disgusting things because they disgust me! You understand, Boy?
Shut up! Shut up!
From what?
And you want to tell me you saw Norman Bates' mother.
You didn't even mention the suicides. Did you notice the beaut that came in today?
Never mind your theories. Was she ever conscious?
Okay--I'll be here at eight.
It may be, but to my notion, those that monkeys with what they got no business to get queer sooner or later.
Maybe you're right.
[Lot of] How many cats you have--what's the matter-- rats?
Yeah--thousands, and right in my back yard.
Fine. Mrs. Buckley will be all right when she gets used to the idea.
Oh, just the basement. Some day I intend to build an experimental laboratory down there. It will save me from intrusion.
I'm going to call the police.
Yes!
A voice ...
Joseph is reading the diary, which arouses his interest more and more. It is as if he finds a connection between what he reads and the fearful events that have taken place around him. An extract from the diary is shown.
Another fragment of the diary is shown [having to do with vampires].
The blood transfusion is completed. While Marc himself is looking after the patient, the nurse leads Nikolas into an adjoining room, where she makes him sit down and prepares his bandage. The doctor stands bending over Léone.
I wish you wouldn't be so sarcastic about Ralph. He's the sweetest kid I know.
I met one last night ... all the money this side of Peoria.
Thank you.
At any time. You will always be welcome.
It is no trouble at all, my child. This is the strange, vicarious pleasure that remains for me -- to see others enjoy the beauty I used to create.  My footing is not too secure.
Nothing doing. This is my percentage. You birds are going to get yours. And anyhow, I found this dump.
Well, is it my fault if nothing happens?
That is none of our business.  But you bring me something for the next edition if it's only a recipe for spaghetti! 
Well, that's got nothing to do with this case. Can I handle this my way?
You cannot. I'm still editor of this sheet.
Sleep on it ... we'll get it tomorrow.
Hey, Mattie, dig into the morgue and send up all the art you have on Joan Gale.
Come down to earth. Do you think they would dare do anything like that? Don't you think they'd know that figure would be recognized? Shake your head real hard -- you'll be all right.
Don't remember what day that was, do you?
I'm people which the old year saw out. I'm canned, fired!
No foolin' -- any suspect?
Who? Old Santa Claus there? That's easy for anyone with my sex appeal. He's a pushover. Watch me stand that old dodo on his ear.
She laughed and told me that we were being silly, that we didn't care for each other any more but we needn't hate each other ...  ... She said she wanted to be friends.
My partner believes that I should build a horror chamber, immortalizing the hideous crimes and criminals of London. At such times Marie Antoinette has reassured me, she has promised me recognition for the devotion I gave to her.
She will undoubtedly keep her promise. If you'll grant me the privilege, I'd like to submit this work to the Royal Academy when I get back.
You're insane.
To lunch, you say. I am having coffee and sandwiches sent in. We are not leaving until we have everything ready for the opening.
All right, I'll tell them. They're right here in front.
You have done well, and now I, too, have something for you. Come.
I wonder if I could have her pose for me.
I'm glad they didn't hold you downtown.
Day or night?
Inside every semi-conductor... you have two particles, with opposite charges, separated by an impassable barrier...
A five hundred foot thick steel wall.  But the connection between these two electrons is so --
Wait.  I want to tell you something.
What?
I said she isn't here. NOW you go home. Be a nice boy and go home.
But we must respect that power, we must be in awe of it.
Bad is bad, Buddy. There ain't no sense to it.
I don't hear you. I just turn my back on that kind of talk and look away.
You were pretty bad, huh?
Why, it has just made me ill, Buddy. I'm sick. I don't want to eat nothin', I don't, and me I got a good appetite, that ain't nat'ral for me. I'm ill.
I fell madly in love with him when he called me Rosebud. You know that first day when I come and he said I looked graceful like a capital letter S and called me Rosebud? I fell madly in love with that man right then.  But it's a lost love, Buddy. He's a good man and won't have nothin' to do with me.
Aw, come on, Rose, I want to see what the nipple on it is like.
Good night, Rose.
I have a knack for designing clothes. But I had to buy the shoes and the pocketbook.
Take a little walk with me, huh?
Boy did I get sick of rabbit. But later on after Momma died and Daddy wasn't doin' nothin' but drinkin', I sure would of been glad for a little rabbit stew. You know, I oughtn't to of told you about what Daddy done when I was a child. Until them rabbits ruined him, he was a real good man, Buddy.
All right, what do you know?
Well, a little.
I don't know.
Yeah, he's still up there.
Well, it's not very plain.
She's got somebody in there, Brother! His shoes are on the back porch -- there they were, naked and smiling at me!  Rose, open this door immediately!
Walked, in all that heat? It's a wonder she hasn't got sunstroke. I'll phone Daddy and you go get Doll Baby and Waski.
Mother, I have to tell the truth. I wasn't reading Huckleberry Finn, I was reading one of those Little Dirty Comic Books.
Stop gagging like that and putting on a show, and swallow it.
Yes, I did, mother. Your hearing aid isn't working right. I said ahhh-dam stuff.
Now I have a plan about Rose, an educational plan. She's getting better and we don't want any more trouble --  Brother, you ought to hear this.
I'll be right back.
No.
He had his hand on her titty.
Buddy, that was my place.
Buddy, I'm worried about Rose.
That's the least of her troubles. Rose had a rare tropic disease and the little tubes in her that babies swim down are all stopped up, she told me all about it.
What sad news? Did her cancer come back?
Not for long, boy. I've outstayed my welcome already.
All right, Daddy. We have our drink, we're out on the patio, you have prepared me for it. Rose's cancer has come back, hasn't it?
That's a hell of a thing to say. Why, Rose?
Any major operation is dangerous. However, as we know from her previous illness, she's a very strong girl.
Well, well, well. So Miss Rosebud has arrived. Un-hmm. And you're all assembled here. Yes, indeed. Un hmmm.
I asked you what you think of Rosebud, now that she's been here a while.
Hotcha character. If I had to live with your cynicism, I wouldn't want to live at all. What you can't understand is that the creative forces of the universe are positive, not negative.
Forgive my crudity, darlin'. I don't understand these deeper things the way you do.
Well, it is a little tight. But it isn't as bad as all that. No one will notice unless they have such thoughts in the first place.
I don't think you understand her. It isn't sex she wants, it's love she wants and this is the only way she knows how to get it.
Scoundrels? They weren't scoundrels, they were just boys.
I don't intend to mock you, dear. I respect your philosophy. It's beyond my comprehension, but I respect it.
But morals come from the heart, not from rigid rules and empty laws. And in her heart Rose has never hurt anyone and she never would. Therefore, she's not immoral. Not really.
Now look, darlin', this is no time to go off into the fourth dimension.
If you mean sex, you couldn't be more wrong. Rose likes those boys and men, she has love in her heart, and that is what they want. It's the most rare and beautiful thing in life and that is why they follow her.
You don't like him because he's a Yankee. He's a brilliant doctor.
She already told you, she doesn't know.
I forgot that Rose will lie like a child. She's no more pregnant than I am, she just doesn't want to go to that farm!
Honey, that's no way to talk to the Doctor, he's merely doing his job, dear.
Well, now, darlin'... give me a chance to defend myself.
Well, I... I hadn't thought about it that much. I was thinking... well, it's an idea, the girl is oversexed, and...
Honey, he is Mr. Right.
Rosebird Baby, you are the light of my life, darlin'. How did we ever get by without you?
If you've got time before you go "out," get me a half-a-cup of coffee, Rose. Not a whole cup, a half-a-cup.
Oh, no, sir.
Yes, sir.
Well, it was a silly question.
Mine.
Well, I'll pay you that back sometime, Mr. Hillyer.
It's Dave Wilkie! I'm Dave Wilkie, don't you remember me?
She looks terrible, just awful.
Deathly afraid of it. Her people were poor tenant farmers and she doesn't know anything about doctors or medicine or hospitals.
I beg your pardon, epi-zoo-tics? Do you mean "epi-zoo-ot-tics," an animal epidemic?
Gonorrhea?
Well, that's pathetic. Poor Rose, what a life she has had.
No, you shouldn't have, it was needlessly cruel. She thinks she has cancer and is going to die.
I am thinking particularly of the other ovary. As a rule I don't believe in removing it. The woman's hormonal system is profoundly disturbed, she is subject to possibly serious depression, she loses many of her secondary sexual characteristics for example, her breasts might shrink and become flabby, facial hair might appear along with a coarsening of the features, and of course her sexual drive is greatly diminished, especially in a girl or young woman. For these reasons I am opposed to removing the other ovary, as a rule. Do you follow me?
Let him be guided not by my wishes and not by Rose's wishes, although I am sure they are identical. Let him be guided by the wishes of the creative power of life itself, because that is what has spoken through me tonight.
Be quiet, Rose.
Well, there's no reason you shouldn't go out, Rose... in moderation.
I don't want to. When I was lyin' there in that hospital bed at death's door I says to myself, I ain't goin' out no more. If I ever get outta this, I'll just stay home.
I know it's embarrassing... but who were you exposed to, dear? ROSE Well, now, Mrs. Hillyer, I... ah-h, that's kinda hard to say.
I don't mind.
Well... what can I do?  You've created a dilemma...  And, look at the that. Time's running out.  I wonder... how can I impress upon you just exactly how frustrating this situation is for me?
Who cares?
Word is, while the vice cops on the East Coast were standing around playing pocket pool, 300 kilos of heroin got smuggled into New York City.  And, right now it's making a cross-country journey to Hollywood, U.S.A.
Again.
I don't know what you're talking about, man.  Even if I did, I'm not so crazy I'm gonna cross Zimmermann.
Alright!  Alright... put me down...
Whoa, thanks, man.  These are cool. They'll be collector's items.
It's personal.  We'll hook up at Billy-Boy's pad in an hour.  See ya then.
Wh... what... ?!
Entertainers don't count.
What about him?
You've never heard of Napoleon brandy, Mister Smarty-Pants?  How do you think it got its name?
Wha... ?
Birth control's important.
Bullshit.
You never heard of physics, Einstein? The laws of physics.  The more ballast we keep closer to the rear tires...
Well, I got something..  Pop-Sweet's accounting ledger for the Disco-Strip.  All the money transactions.  Look...  Someone's putting their initials beside the weekly totals.  Like they're acknowledging a deposit.
No.
Nope.
There probably is.
Bummer.
What happened, Kittle?  We used to be friends.  You used to know how the game was played.
There was a time when you did things the right way, till you hooked up with that fat-assed-boozehound and the soul-sister.
Just 'cause you belong to some fancy-pants club, doesn't make you any less a murderer.
First of all, the Constitution wasn't writtem till 1787...
You know what I mean.
You think this is so easy?
That's right, white bread.  Give it up.  Right now.
Guys... all we've got is each other. Don't we know that by now?
Nothing's broke.  Keep sewing.  And quit pacing, you big ox.  You're making me skittish.
Whatever goes bang.
Do tell.
Well, that's what I heard, and that's what I choose to believe.
So are you, Pop-Sweet.  That's why...
Proceed with the countdown. All groups assume attack coordinates.
Yoda will always be with you.
You father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your father was destroyed. So what I have told you was true... from a certain point of view.
His lightsaber.
Are you all right?
How are we doing?
The same as always.
That bad, huh? Where's Leia?
You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient.
Yeah, sure.
Threepio, tell them if they don't do as you wish, you'll become angry and use your magic.
Hold me.
Charges!  Come on, come on!
Here's the terminal.
Good, I hate long waits.
Come on! Come on!
I hope so, Commander, for your sake. The Emperor is not as forgiving as I am.
Red Leader standing by.
Tell me.
She was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad.  Why are you asking me all this?
I know. Somehow...I've always known.
Then you know why I have to face him.
So, you have accepted the truth.
Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force.  But beware.  Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side are they.  Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.
Splendid! We have been without an interpreter since our master got angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him.
I told you, my car broke down.
Yes.
I really loved the skilful way You beat the other girls To the bride's bouquet.
Oh, it's probably some kind of hunting lodge for rich weirdos.
But it seems so unhealthy here.
Weiss.
Oh don't be so shy.
Makes you cry
Was all I had to say
Now I
Smile and that will mean I may
No no no no.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime. That ain't no crime.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
Shell-shocked!
Ain't skated since I was fifteen -- That's when I started fightin' -- gotta watch the ankles. Yeah, fightin' use to be tops with me, but no more. All I wanted to prove was I weren't no bum -- That I had the stuff to make a good pro.
By accident?
I had it pulled. People callin' all the time.  Who needs it -- Who'd you wanna call?
I'll call your brother.
I don't think I belong here.
...I've never been in a man's apartment before.
Could ya take off that hat.
It did.
...What's to say? I dunno what he wants from me --
What did you say about a pet shop?
I don't want ya cleanin' nobody else's cages no more.
I gotta go out for a while.
No... I can't!
Roosevelt finished last in his class -- Beethoven was deaf, an' Helen Keller was blind -- I think Rocky has a good chance.
I always seen ya had the best, but did ya ever think of puttin' in a good word for me with this scumbag!
...Thanks.
You're referring to the much publicized bicentennial fight?
Still to be held in Philadelphia?
Don't like yours neither.
C'mon, man, it's cold, man.
The Champion is smiling and toying with the man -- trying to give the fans their money's worth and make a show of it with the badly out-classes challenger -- Another left to right combination. I feel sorry for --
Mr. Gazzo wants the two hundred now!
Waits! -- Be smart. Ya don't have to break nothin' -- Here, take my coat, it's worth fifty-sixty dollars. It's yours.
I figure if I break the thumb this guy gets thrown outta his job and can't pay nothin' no more.
How'd you know?
Hey -- if a good man can make a better life, let him make it.
Did you hear what I said?
'Cause that's the way guys are -- They laugh when ya talk dirty. They think ya cute for a while, but then ya getta reputation an' watch out. Nobody's ever gonna take ya serious. Ya get no respect... I gotta use a bad word -- Whore. You'll end up maybe becomin' a whore.
What was I gonna say?
...Tomato?
Facts is facts. I run a business here -- I'm cleanin' house --
Spider Rice.
Ya puttin' me on?
When was they here?
...I said that before.
Look at all them other fighters. Real good boys. Good records. Colorful. Fight their hearts out for peanuts -- But who cared? Nobody. They got it shoved in their back door. Nobody ever give them a shot at the title...
I done it all. I've done an' seen everything'. Believe what I'm tellin' ya -- Ya shoulda seen the night in Brooklyn, I smacked 'Ginny' Russo outta the ring, September 14, 1923 -- same night Firpo knocked Dempsey outta the ring. But who got the Press? He did. He had a manager -- September 14, 1923.
See what?
Inventin' jokes ain't easy.
The owner was suppose to pick him up three weeks ago.
We're not responsible for animals left over thirty days -- We board it ain't a animal shelter, Y'know... Adrian, I want you to clean all those cat cages downstairs, they're a mess. 
I hate the friggin' game... I'd like to talk some business.
Gazzo's gotta come to you.
Ya gotta have a guy help ya exercise, mebbe somebody to be standin' by with a towel or run errands, y'know.
Keep this job, ya eat better.
Sure I like her.
What can I do about it?
So where is it then?
Yeah?  Does he wear pants this color?
I'm not worried about you.  I'm worried about the safe.
Is this paper even good?
Check the scrawl.
I don't wanna think.  I wanna drink.
Probably lookin' for a good place to stick a knife.
What've I got to lose?  You okay, Dolores?
Ask her...
So you're Cloverleaf?
What the hell's a freeway?
No...
Does it hurt?
No, no, no... I love my husband.
That's not Roger.  It's one of Doom's men.  He killed R.K. Maroon.
Aren't you the lucky one...
I Just thought I'd drop by and show you a photograph.
Aah!
In other words, the whole goddamn world knows you're here!  Out!  Get out!
Don't do that!  I'm innocent I tell ya. The police'll just dip me.  They were waitin' for me when I got home last night.  I ran.
Why, you crazy Toon... I've been out there riskin' my neck for you.   I come back here and you're singin' and dancin'.
A laugh can be a powerful thing, Eddie. Sometimes it's the only weapon we have in life.
I think I prefer the Smith and Wesson variety.
But, Eddie, you know what happens when...
Gee, you shamuses are a tough audience, but what happened to you that was so dark, lurid, embittering?
Safe?
Piano.  Guy got away, disappeared into Toontown.  Nobody ever saw him again.
No, it's not.
Forget it.
Not before I satisfy my sense of moral outrage.
From this box here...
Then I defy you, stars! JULIET! JULIET! I will hence tonight.
Why that pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline. Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.
Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet, Hath sent a letter to his father's house.
Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he dares, being dared.
By my head here come the Capulets.
Not having that, which, having, makes them short.
Good heart, at what?
Soft! I will go along; An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste.
I fear, too early: for my mind misgives Some consequence yet hanging in the stars Shall bitterly begin his fearful date With this night's revels and expire the term Of a despised life closed within my breast By some vile forfeit of untimely death. But He, that hath the steerage of my course, Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen.
Here is my gold. Worse poison to men's souls, than these poor compounds that thou mayest not sell.
Hold Daughter!
The last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.
Welcome.
Geth thee to be and rest, for thou has need.
Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed. If that thy bent of love be honourable, Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow, By one that I'll procure to come to thee, Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite; And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
[Within] Juliet!
[Within] Juliet!
What haste? can you not stay awhile? Do you not see that I am out of breath?
Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I! O, my back! Other' other side,--O, my back.
And from my soul too. Else beshrew them both.
Amen
Well, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do; They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
I take thee at thy word.
Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.
If my heart's dear love--
Do not swear: although I joy in thee, I have no joy of this contract to-night: It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden; Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night! This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath, May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet. Good night.
I will not fail: 'tis twenty year till then.
It is, It is! Hie hence, be gone, away.  O, now be gone. More light and light it grows.
Pink for flower.
I thought all for the best.
His name is Romeo, and he's a Montague; The only son of your great enemy.
I don't know.  I was thinking...Maybe the three of us might partner up -- guns for hire, that sort of thing.
Who the fuck are you?
Best beer in the world known to man or God.
Oh yeah?  Whatta you drink, then?
So you thought that maybe I'd grown too attached to this charade I've been playing, is that it?
I thought I did.
You lose them!
Shut up!!!  Shut up and drive!  I'm your superior officer and you will do as I goddamn well say, is that understood?!?
No, Seamus.  I heard you the first time.
Once.
Is that right?
I know I don't have to, Sam, it's just that, for once, I want to.  when I was a -  Patriot, it was a given I'd sleep with any man it was deemed necessary for me to sleep with.  You know: any man who needed setting up.  Sometimes so we might blackmail him, sometimes so he could be killed.  Sometimes so I could kill him myself. IRA isn't exactly an enlightened feminist organization, Sam.  To most of the men I with I was always the girl.  "Send the girl to do it."  "Tell The girl to take care of it."  "Have the girl fuck him."  But I look at you and I get this feeling you take me for what I am: no more, no less.
I'm a patriate.
Don't even think that I'm buying that.
Where do you get off saying word one? All the time pretending to be one of us, it's the same thing we were doing, Seamus and myself.  And here you are so high and mighty, like you're so different from the rest of us.
Ready when you are...
Shut up!
I think not.  After you...
Then you better find it in your heart to tell me, Francois, because while your death is inevitable, it still isn't decided how painful it's going to be.
But you hate each other!
What's a little hate between business partners?
Figured enough to know there's an odd man out and I'm looking at him.
A post office box.
I'm in the middle of saving you people a great deal of money -- the least you could do is have the decency to pay me!
So what do we do?
What I do is none of your concern.  What you should do is wait for my next phone call.  I'm going to find a place where I can tilt the field in my favor.  When I'm ready, I'll call you and tell you what I want you to do.
There is one other thing...
What's that?
Not exactly.
Yeah.
Something important?  A thing that cannot wait?
I didn't expect that he would.
Perhaps forged is a better word.  Like steel.  Like a sword.  You're a modern Samurai.  I've spent my life around extraordinary men -- men like Vincent. But I've never seen anyone like you.  I'm afraid Vincent will die if he goes with you.
You seem one to me.
Who else would you be?
To see a man about a thing.
Jujitsu.
What's the difference?
I do.
Watch that one, he's an ex-spook for sure, maybe Stasi, maybe KGB.  He's smart, Gregor is.
I've wondered that myself.  None of this answers my question, though...  Why bring me?
I just wanted to see something.
That there was a gun pointed at me.
Please, help yourself.  Smoke as many you'd like.
You don't have to do this.
Yes I do.
How could you have done that?
You think?
You said it yourself: Gregor's not dead. If they had the package, they'd have killed him.
You don't know?  Bullshit, you had her, there was no way out.
If I'm going to die for the CIA, I'm going to go out smoking.  Besides, there's half a forest between us and them, they can't see a goddamned thing.
I guess that's for the best.
It's an international thing.  Several different peoples involved, criminals from all over the world, experts brought together to do a job.  But maybe the most interesting thing about it is that preeminent in the plot we find the Russian Mob and the IRA in bed together. An unlikely group of partners.
You sure?
I'm sure.
I don't know what you're -
Cash and what?
That's what everyone thinks.  But according to him, when it's the real thing, it's quite an intimidatin' environment in which to concentrate.
Hell, it won't be us!
We'll figure something out.
What makes you so sure?
Because...I know.
That's right!
I don't know.
What are you thinking?
I...I can't do that.
That's not what I mean.
Listen. Do you want to go to jail? Taking evidence, tampering with a crime scene.  You know what they'd do.
He'll tell them everything to save his ass. That's how they all work it!
He's probably made copies.  He's not going to give them up to us.
Neither do I.
I don't think he's going to be doing any bargaining with us, the stupid son-of-a-bitch!  Besides, I'm not giving him a third of anything, not after everything we had to do.
Well what are we supposed to do?
Not bad enough to kill him.
There it is...now what about the others?
You killed him...
We're doing what we gotta do, to protect ourselves!
You don't know if he was really gonna --
We'll take the money and disappear! We can do it, spend it on the move. Even if all of it's marked, there's ways around it.
Rock solid.
Just take it in stride.
I gotta take some money out, that's what for.
It was all over the local news. Dwayne was there, acting all official.
Are you sure you're OK?
I'm in here.
He started digging through my closet, something he never does.
Dammit, I'm so sick of this.
Well I was just throwing out ideas...
I'll be there for you.  He won't try anything while I'm there.  I promise.  I'll protect you.
I don't remember.  We get a lot of people in here.
A week ago, at most.
Am I speaking English here?  How-about-you-give-us-what-you- have-and-leave?
First you question my integrity, then you call me stupid...  ...that hurts, son.
Hell, I don't know.  If I had some input I'd offer it up.
Maybe I should come along.
Lingerie...
Why?
About what?
Uh, sure.  I hear you.
You walked in here looking like you just ate a shit sandwich.
I didn't say that.  You did.
I think I am.
Stop!  Stop!  I don't need the money.  You can have it all.
I tell you this world just keeps getting more and more violent.
Well basically I forgot about it, you know, you never win these things, but this time, well...
Give me the bad news.
That doesn't tell us much. Did you run a check on the gas like I told you?
Two hundred cops?  Was Mario Sanchez there?  He owes me money.
Those are five hundred dollar chips.
Two-hundred thousand dollars?  Who wants a hundred dollars?
I'm up a hundred and fifty-grand. That's a Ferrari.  Do they sell those here in the gift shop?  Somebody cash me out!
I got held up at a wedding in Tai Koo. Ricky here yet, I need to get his requests.
You've been asking loud questions in all the wrong places all morning.  How come you always save me for last, James? When are you gonna learn.  Shit don't happen I don't know about.
Isabella Molina, from San Juan.  That seat is taken.
San Juan!  You must know my good friend Pedro Martinez Hernandez Hector Elizondo.
El Capitan?
Well, I'm very tempted.  It's such a beautiful yacht.  What's it called?
I'm Lee's new muscle, his right arm -- and don't let the robe fool you.  This is the only color they had left.  Now get up!
That's Chief Inspector, he got promoted.
C'mon, Lee.  He's going to jail.  You won, now just put the gun down.
Oh yes, she's very nice.
I'm just in town for the weekend, taking in the sights.
You're right, you're a smart guy.  Most counterfeiters only get ten cents on the dollar.  But this is an even swap.  Pure genius.
You invited them to get naked and sacrifice a small goat.
No.
Are you kidding, they love me.  I'm a star, Lee.  A god to these people!
I knew you were lying.
I'm sorry.
Man, are you crazy?  You think that scares me?  I'm from  L.A.  We invented gangs.  We were having gang wars before anybody even thought about it.  We get royalties from other gangs.  Now gimme your badge and gun and I'll show you how it's done.
You just said you're their worst nightmare - and to line their mothers up for a milking.
My bullshit?  I'm not the one who goes to a karaoke bar filled with gangsters! I'm not the one who goes to massage parlors to bust crime lords!
Who died?
What?
I cannot go to LA...
Who?
Because when the shooting started he was way too cool.  See most white people, when there's shooting, they either hide in a toilet or start screaming high pitched like "Aaaahhh!!! Aaaahh!!!!
Hey, I didn't mean to call you pathetic.
Let me guess, she couldn't handle the cop thing -- never knowing if you were dead or alive.  I've seen it a million times.
Excuse me?
Hot?  I'm freezing my ass off.
You're just jealous 'cos the girl picked me.  I'm tall, dark and handsome, you're third world ugly.
I don't believe in reincarnation.  So I won't see you in the next world.
Yes.  We have heaven.
I think we should stop talking.
How was the sex?
I knew it.  What does she know.  You want me to sing something?
I'll remember that next time I'm fighting a box.
Who's Benjamin?
You could never kick my ass.  You mama's boy.
Wait a second.  We can't go in like this.  Look at this place, we gotta look fly.  We gotta Mac out.
No problem.
She's going home to New York.  I need some ice.
The Plaza Hotel?
I'm fine.
I'll take him.
Nobody can protect me.  I'll make a deal with you, Lee.  But only iff you'll get me out of Hong Kong.
The answers you seek can be found in Heaven on Earth.
Heaven on Earth?  Master, I don't understand.  A temple, where Heaven is on Earth?  A mountain, where Earth reaches for the --
It's a massage parlor downtown.  "Heaven on Earth."  You will find your answers there.
That's some serious poundage in dollars.
Hey, that's whacked!  I thought we was gettin' on here!
They asked for the best street man I had.
It's the same thing!
It was not my intent --
Right....
He was trying to kill me, not you.
Who does not know War?  ³War, hhh, Wo-ooh-wo-ooh-wo-oh.  What is it good for?  Absolutely nothing. Good-God, you all.²
No! You hate me.  Look, I'm gonna do it one time.  That's it.
Excuse me?
Well, I ain't goin' to China.  And neither are you.
FBI calls up my ass, says they need help in Tokyo.  Like I'm supposed to drop everything.
No shark fin, no camel hump.  What you listenin' to?
Oh, I think you like this very much.
They put you in charge?
Not to me. Never to me.
How much they want?
Or somethin'.
All I gotta do is implicate.  The Feds can do a lot with a good implication. Even if you don't get Sparky, I'll bet you get ten to twenty more. Plenty of time to find a nice fella.
Even if you deny the FBI is there, I will assume you are lying.
You have run out of time.  The amount now is two hundred million.  I will call later with instructions.  You will either deliver the money or pick up the body of your daughter.
He is already on the plane.  I hope you will treat him with the same respect you have shown me.
I don't believe you.  My father was explaining to Mr. Griffin.  That is how I found out.
Ike just came by to check out the team.
I'm not running.
I lead Maggie through a visualization exercise.  All the sports shrinks use this head stuff.  Visualize the end zone, if you catch my drift.
You bet ya, Coach.
I didn't want to find out I wasn't for her in the fourth quarter.
And what did you say?
His hair... any color.
I didn't cook up a story.  I had a source.
Or does she pick "NGB'S" -- "Nice Guys, But..."  Nice guys, but I'm cheap. Nice guys, but he lives with his mom... Nice guys, but he just out of prison.
The real story on Miss Carpenter.
Neuter a locust, feed the world.
I don't think that's why she ran.
Oh, I will.
No, I'm not.
Peggy Phleming.  Not the ice skater.
Oh, Betty.  I take it you're going to be making the wedding cake and they say you're throwing --
You'll answer my questions?
You've seen the post-its.  I've already got more juicy material than I need. Why should I pay you dollar one?
Seven-fifty.
No, I'm not afraid.  Just... Maybe someday.
Now that's romantic.  A proposal like that and you didn't find eternal bliss? What went wrong?
No.
Of course.
Yes it is.  And it doesn't mean anything.
Missed me bad, huh?
Are you all right with this?  You think this is funny?
You humiliated me!
I already explained about that.
Every one of those times I was being supportive.  Something you won't understand.
So am I.
I didn't.  And you being the one at the end of the aisle didn't just fix that.
I borrowed it from this guy I know. So?
Yes, I've seen it.  And I have to say it's the rudest and most offensive... joke anybody's ever played on me!
Stop it.  When you talk like that, I get turned on and it frightens me.
Thank you.  Do you think I flirt with Cory?
On anything male that moves?  As opposed to anything male that doesn't move?
But I'm weird.
Peggy, there's distinct possibility that I might be profoundly and irreversibly screwed up.  Despite that, I love you and I can promise that I will no longer flirt with Cory, and I beg your forgiveness.
See, this is a mature relationship. She's really found it.
You and your lucky geese.  You always see geese.
Thank you.  You still think that he was....
Thank you, Dad.
No, it's humiliating and you've been doing it since I was a kid.  I don't like it.  Stop.  You may not like having a daughter with problems.  But guess what?  I don't like having a father who's drunk all the time.  I'll eat in my room.
No, no.  You're her best friend.
You turn it on, you open it and you stand in front of it for a very long time.
I hate boats.
It's not a boat boat.  It's really a house.
We'll stay at the Plaza --
I know.  It makes no sense at all.  Thank God my life is in place.
It was my mother's.
Walter, there's something I have to tell you --
Yes.  But it wasn't really.  It was just...
About what?
They knew it.  Time, distance, nothing could separate them. Because they knew.  It was right.  It was real.  It was...
Right.
I don't know.  I mean, what if I never meet him? What if this man is my destiny and I never meet him?
"I want to meet you..."
You never told me you left your husband because he went on a diet.
And then you left him? He lost weight there and you left him?
That's not what I mean.  I'm going back over there tomorrow and talk to him.  I am.
Thank you.  I love you.
I love that dream.
No, I know that part --
I'll tell you the truth, I heard this guy on a call-in radio show and I might not marry the person I should marry because I've become obsessed with him.
Oh.  Like Glenn Close in that movie.
I know. 
It rains nine months of the year in Seattle.
Walter and I are engaged!
Granny's dress.  Oh, Mom.
Are his folks nice?
It is, isn't it? You make millions of decisions that mean nothing and then one day you decide to order takeout and it changes your life.
What?
Magic.  It was magic.
Magic.
It's been about a year and a half.
She died.
I'm worried about him, he's worried about me, I ride my bike to school, he follows in the car, like I'm not supposed to know he's there.  Now it's Christmas, and you know what happens to people at Christmas.
What kind of person would write to someone they heard on the radio?
I have forty-two.  So that would definitely cover taxicabs, I think.
Jed is having a slumber party New Year's Eve and he invited me.
They called and asked for it.  "Dear Sleepless in Seattle. You are the most attractive man I've ever laid ears on."
You have to give them your phone number or they won't let you go on the air.
Somewhere in the middle.
What?
Is that what she used to sing?
I miss her.  What do you think happens to someone after they die?
I'm starting to forget her.
I know.  But she's here, Jonah. Because I have you.  And as long as I have you, I have your Mom.
Good.
The water tastes better in the kitchen.
No.
This is not a joke.  Thank God Victoria doesn't know.  It would really have hurt her feelings.
Who is Annie?
Get out.
Listen, have I ever done anything really stupid?
No way.  No way I was going to be the first woman you went out with after...  There is no percentage whatsoever in being the first woman anyone goes out with after...
The men would like to know who this gentleman is.
Yeah.
The woman question?
Are you sad?  Are we going to church? For your confession?
With Ramón it's ... pride. I spoke out of the bitterness in me. And he was hurt.
I'd lie on my cot in the cell and I couldn't sleep with the bugs and the stink and the heat. And I'd say to myself, think of something nice. Something beautiful. And then I'd think of you. And my heart would pound against the cot for love of you.
Sure.
Four nights. How did you sleep?
A meeting?
Ramón -- you can't.
Who said anything about giving up? I'll never go back to the company on my knees. Never.
And if you can't understand this you're a fool -- because you can't win this strike without me! You can't win anything without me!
Are we talking to a union spokesman?
She's coming. Charley Vidal gave her a lift.
I don't want you hanging around there, hear?
You Judas ... blood-sucker ...
Tú! Traidor a tu gente! Rompehuelga! Desgraciado!
Are you Australian?
The spiders.
How about in the house?
I don't know .... you could be staking your financial future on stealing Bob Hope's stool specimen.
Don't worry. He's out of town.
Nah. I'm strictly minor league... except for the fucked-up part.
Don't worry about it. Just go across the street and watch. You'll know when it's safe to go back.
These guys are smart. I knew they wouldn't hit a deal unless they knew all the players. I needed a big buyer.
What?
Can you do me a favor? This girl I know, her boyfriend's a real piece of shit-dude's really jamming her up. I promised her I'd try to help.
I know it's not my place to pass judgement on you but ...
My features. They're Finnish.
I'm serious, dude.  You always seem to be on top of things, even when you're tweakin'.
Business.  I need to leave town and I find myself in dire need of some cash.
Palmdale
Was he the president?
I'm not a tweaker.  I don't use drugs. I never had.
And you want me to do you some big favor?
What does that mean?
If you say so.
Pooh-Bear, I don't mean to be rude, but I get the feeling you aren't taking me seriously.
What the fuck are you gonna do about it, dickhead?
Somebody has to help you lazy bastards.
Garcetti thinks everything is shit. He doesn't even like dolphins.
Soon. I promise.  We'll get the charges dropped and you can disappear.  In the mean time, trust me, he has no idea that you ratted him out.
Standard vig.  Minus five for a certain blabber-mouth moron by the name of Jimmy the Finn, who's living proof that natural selection is a flawed theory.
I'm afraid so, Danny.
What's he holding?
Turns out he's connected.
I still don't know what you're talking about.
Look at that place. It's creepy.
Quit feeling sorry for yourself, Tom. It gets old.
Now that's scary!
Resistance?
It was a hard assignment, that's why you got it.
But, sir...I...I...
Figured.
We got us a tent, forty-two feet across, eighteen feet at center, hundred-and-ten foldin' chairs. Circuit's eleven towns, covers all 'a Hasset County and most 'a Weller County.  I expect that upon completion of my military service I will be joinin' said ministry.
You must be a hell a shot.
Like hell, you did.
I am, but I like imported whiskey. So there I am and I hear the biggest ole' coon you ever did hear, 'a rustlin' right there in front of me. That ole' boy comes right out of the brush, I got a clear shot and he knows he's 'bout to meet his maker. I aim, I got my finger tight on the trigger and then I just smile and say to that ole' coon, go on, now, you get out 'a here.  Then I sit down on a hollow log and take me a right long pull a' that mash whiskey.
Wade?
White-walls?
A half-track, anything.
FORWARD!  FORWARD!  NOW REVERSE!
On the other side of the street, crouches in a doorway with Jackson. Upham is a bit in shock, less from the nearness of the bullets than from what Miller just did for him.
Yes.  Do you know Sibelius' Fourth Symphony, The Normandy?
A machine gun.
You don't count.
Fresh out.
Tell that to Private James Ryan. We've got our orders.  Let's go.
Not in so many words, but they tell you you can have all the firepower in the world and if your men don't have good morale, it's not worth a damn.  So if you're scared or empty or half-a-step from a Section Eight, do you tell your men?  Of course not.  You bluff, you lie.
Don't let yourself get killed, if you do, they might make me give back the medal and then I won't be able to lip off to colonels anymore.
Yes, sir.
Sure, meet me at the top, we'll start the paperwork.
Stay at it until you get fire control.  Keep 'em down, wait for the navy.
No, I'm not, Kaback is, honest.  Or what about Faulkner?  Or that little guy with the glasses?
Yeah, how so?
There's always a bright side.
Sure, what do you want to know?
Well, sir, in purely arithmetic terms, since when does six equal one?  What's the sense in risking six guys to save one?
Never mind, don't worry, we'll pick up this kid, high-tail it back to division, everything'll work out fine.
B:  Ryan is dead.  He's been blown up by the German equivalent of Wade, whose name I know you don't want me to mention.  There's nothing to find. The biggest piece is the size of a pea.  We wander around, looking for him until the Germans pick us off, one after another.
Neither do I, sir.  C:  And this is the worst one, we find Ryan and he's wounded.  Not only does he not carry my gear, we have to carry his gear. And him.
Have it your way, Captain.
That's not where I am.  Miller No? Where are you?
Here they come.
FIRES a burst.  More Germans drop.
Sir, if the Krauts are holding this bridge when division shows up, our guys are going to be sitting ducks.
I hear you sir, but I'm not leaving.
Yeah, yeah.  I want you right next to me, no matter where I go, you understand?
And Sarge?
Sarge?  He was the best friend I ever had.  Lemme tell you about Sarge...
No, I just happen to take the Captain's advice and look at the bright side of things.
He's fast, Captain, I saw him.
Freaked out.  Trying to keep his eyes on the perimeter.  Can't.
Who knows?  It worked.
Why would you stay so long with an operation that is so clearly not a growth enterprise?
Is it a gift for your wife?  Are you getting a set together? 
Good for her.
I'll take the whole set.
Okay, thanks.
He's a mess!
Lloyd, honey, just come home, okay?
That's just so embarrassing.
I already did.
You're an inspiration Lloyd; you should go on the seven hundred club or something.
I didn't think anyone would get it.
Okay.
Now this is the only thing your mother ever gave me that I kept. Now it's yours.  Go ahead, open it.
I love you dad.
You won it.  You're going to study at the finest institute at England, the toughest fellowship in the country, and you won.
Dad, I'm so glad I went.  Goodnight.
Lloyd was such a gentleman.  He was funny and nervous and strange, and I met people that I never would have met before, then I blew it.  I called him basic.  Can you believe I did that?
I was irresponsible, I should have called.
Dad, I'm so sorry.  I know this is a bad time.
Swear to god.
But I found the money.
Honey, about what?
Hi.
Okay.  Oh, here's Ray.  Just talk to him because when you don't, your mouth turns down.
Yeah.
So you're monumentally busy?
It's the worst job since keymaster.
Bye.
They knew of you.  Now they know you.
So what's your job this summer?
Job?  Being a great date.
Okay, bye.
What did you say?
If you'll just maybe ease it into second.
Yeah.
Yes.  Are you shaking?
You're cold.
I don't know.  I'm happy.
Why didn't you tell me?
I don't know what you're going to say, but I think that...
How can I look at you and say this?
Yeah you do.
Lloyd, we shared the most intimate thing two people can share.
No.
No, that's fine.  She'll tell everybody, but that's fine.
What?
Good to know.
Your only mistake is that you didn't dump her first.  Diane Court is a showpony.  You need a stallion, my friend.  Walk with us and you walk tall.
That's one of the things I wanted to talk to you about sir.
I'm the distraction that's going to England with her sir.  Are you alright sir?  Are you okay?
Dude, why do you think I keep her tapes?  They're going to be valuable some day.
Hey.
Alright.  Key?
Thanks a lot Lloyd.
Alright!
We're full on bonded.
Now you're back.
What -
You're kidding.
We're going to be making so much money, none of this is going to matter -
Yeah, what's that?
True.
What's going on?
When?
You did, but you didn't.
That's great.
How do you do?
I need a drink.
Whoever.  They're the ones.  They'd appreciate some kind of gesture from me.
I think most people right now have other priorities.
Something they can hold in their hands.
But it's less.  It's less than what I would pay a Pole.  That's the point I'm trying to make.  Poles cost more.
Thank you.
What other point is -
They arrived, can you believe it?
Well, sure.  So would I.  So would you. I wouldn't worry about it.  We'll get it right one of these days.
There will be generations because of what you did.
File a grievance with the Economic Office, it's your right.
We're aware of that.
Find me every variation of Himbry and what was the other name...
No, he quit - the whole God thing--he has issues. The previews for next week...
Okay, okay. I'll call now. I'll call you back.
Ted? Where are you? Are you drinking? Hold on.
"Drink with your brain." That's our motto. Who are you calling for?
No, I don't.
Parents are always responsible. It all starts in the home.
You’re all in this together?
Definitely Whitney.
Not one bit.
She dumped me.
Yeah.
I'll get my jacket.
Let us decide that.
No, it's not.
I don't really know what happened in Woodsboro, Sid. But I know you don't trust me.
Randy somebody.
I got it..
We’re hoping for the death penalty. I have this whole DEAD MAN WALKING swan song exit planned.
..so we had to be different but yet the same because if you venture to far away from your orginal story you completely alienate the audience...
And deep down I'm a good person? Make no mistake, Dewey, I'm a shit.
Not good.
A bloody knife. A ghost mask. Something like that?
..and as lonely as I am...
The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.
They thought it was a publicity stunt.
Dewey, I'm completely equipped with mace, alarm whistle, keyring, knife, a degree in defensive combat...
You're pretty when you're angry.
I'm everywhere.
No, Gale, I'm just getting started. Seeya soon.
Yes, goddammit!
I don’t know.
No, she killed her boyfriend. Randy was a friend. MICKEY Watch out, Derek.
Easy black boy.
Guys, guys, I'm sorry but, no way.
We've set you each at a five dollar quota.
I just love being a sister.
What are you talking about?
Do you work for her now?
Very good. Now we play ROUND 2.
What?! But I did everything you said to do!
I'm sorry Miss Weathers. Allow me to introduce myself, MARK KINCAID, L.A.P.D.  Are you familiar with the actor Ben Damon, or the actress CHRISTINE PERKINS?
A note?
I'd love to help, really I wouldn't mind being sliced at again by a maniacal psychopath, but I honestly don't know where Sidney is. After Windsor she dropped off the face of the Earth. The only other person that might know is, , not going to talk.
And who would that be?
Yes well we have a suspect, so don't get that worried.
But you won't. You're a good man detective. We think alike. I know you need my help. And I know you know I need your help.
Ben Damon. Christine Perkins. Sarah Darling. Tom Prinze. That's four, last time I learned how to count.
Excuse me?
The killer called her.
He could've monitored the calls on a scanner. Did you call her from the set?
And what made you think it was Sidney?
Listen, Detective, I wanna see this studio where all this shit's going down.
I'm out back. Tied up. Hurry Sid! The killer's looking for you! Quick untie me!
DEWEY! IT'S GALE!
Do you really mean it this time Gale?
Yes. Look, let's get something straight Dewey, I got into this shit cause the police came looking for ME. Not cause I'm out to make the SUNRISE STUDIOS SLASHINGS.
Why would the police come to you?
What about me?
You used to say that was our strength.
Off the record.
I'm sorry, this is too good!
Fuck!
Sid, this is detective Kincaid.
Has anyone else every used your phone?
Well it's a honor to be here amongst so many fans of the genre. And I must say that any of you worried that Jerry Rapp, or Tori or David not returning to complete the STAB trilogy, have no fear, Roman is here. Aided with my excellent cast of newcomers I believe we're going to pull off one of the best Stabs yet.
Sure.
I know right. It was kinda weak. That's cause Will Kennison only wrote a rough treatment of it. The script was written by some new guy. He wrote Arlington Street.
Oh shit it's my cell!
I am Gale Weathers!
And as a sane person.  For you that must be quite a stretch.
That's funny.
Do you get any of my witty humor? I mean, you did play me for three movies.  His two hands, dingus.
Get real, that would make me a suspect!
Tom Prinze, tanked as usual. That's a shocker.
You mean what's left of us.  Yeah I'm running on empty anyways. Gotta refuel.
No I need to call you. Just you.
Because I'm trying to build your self-esteem. You're far too sensitive.
And then he killed you and then shoots himself in the head. It's a perfect ending.
Everyone dies but us. We get to carry on and plan the sequel. Let's face it, these days -- you gotta have a sequel.
You sleep in THAT?
He's here. He's trying to kill me...
Is it the sex thing? Am I being too pushy?
But you're right -- enough is enough. I can't wallow in the grief process forever and I can't keep lying to myself about who my mom was.
Sure it is, Sid. It's all a movie. Life's one great big movie. Only you can't pick your genre.
What?
Yeah... I think so.
Stop it!
Got the ending figured out yet? Time's running out.
Not so fast. We're gonna play a little game. It's called GUESS WHO JUST CALLED THE POLICE AND REPORTED YOUR SORRY MOTHERFUCKING ASS?
To apologize.
Who is this?
I don't think so.
Why? You wanna ask me out?
I told you not to hang up on me.
I'm getting scared.
I'm telling you the truth. I lied before...
His name wouldn't be Steve, would it?
NOOO!
...please...
I'll even give you a warm up question.
I know, I should be in New York covering the Sharon Stone stalker but who knew? Please, call me Gale. You look awfully young to be a police officer.
He's not a suspect, is he?
Ma'am, I am the Deputy of this town.
Nah... it's just this town's way of not taking me serious.
You can't be here, Tatum. This is an official crime scene.
And my Dad? Any word on him?
Afraid not.
She's tough.
Keeping my eye on Sidney.
He'd have to be crazy. Where's Sidney?
When did that ever stop you? You can't sit on this. This is huge.
Prep the compact, we'll hide it in a window and tape all of tonight's festivities.
About thirty seconds.
As long as it records I don't give a shit. We're not doing a remote.
Kenny. Camera. Now.
Maybe she was hot for Steve and killed them both in a jealous rage.
Aha, Randy, you gave yourself away. Are you calling from work? Tatum's on her way over.
I like that thing you're doing with your voice, Randy. It's sexy.
The question is not who am I. The question is where am I?
LEAVEMEALONE!
No? Oh, well... I'm hitting the sack. My flight leaves first thing in the morning. Now the expo runs all weekend so I won't be back til Sunday. There's cash on the table and I'll be staying at the Raleigh Hilton...
Yeah, I'm off early -- curfew you know.  Now that's poor taste.
The why'd the police let him go?
It's 1995 -- motives are incidental.
I had 'em hid in the foreign section.
He came to make up.
There goes my chance with Sid.
You guys can go up to my parents room? To talk and... whatever.
Why are you doing this?
Tell your mom I said thanks.
Don't worry. Casey and Steve didn't bite it til way after ten.
No way.
For once, Stu, drop it.
You're wound too tight, Mills.  Let it go.
I'll get a job, maybe on a farm.  I'll work on the house.
What are you talking about?
I have no understanding of this place anymore.
Really?
I read about it in the paper.
Who are you?  What are you doing out here?
I mean, at this point, what would it hurt if you told us a little about yourself?
Not me.  I'm not special.  I'm not exceptional.  This is, though.  What I'm doing.
You only killed a bunch of innocent people so you could get your rocks off.  That's all.
I seem to remember knocking on your door.
Maybe I thought I could do more good here than there.  I don't know.  Look, it'd be great by me if we didn't start right off kicking each other in the balls.  But, you're calling the shots, Lieutenant, so... however you want it to go.
But, why would there be so many pieces in his stomach if it were nothing?  It must have been intentional.
All day Saturday, and all day Sunday.  The murderer would want Gould to take his time.  To have to sit there and decide. Where do you make the first cut?  There's a gun in your face... but, what part of your body is expendable?
And, if it's a threat.
Seven Terraces of Purgation.
For now, let's just consider the books as the murderer's inspiration. The books and sermons are about atonement for sin.  And, these murders have been like forced attrition.
Totally unrelated victims.
You tell me.  I'm new in town.
He doesn't have the desire somehow.  Our killer seems to have more purpose.  More purpose than Victor could ever conceive of.
We'll tag along.
I got him.  I got the son-of-a-bitch. See, I was doing really good up till then. Lots of street busts.  I've always had this weird luck... everything always went my way, but this was wild.  I got him with one shot... right between the eyes.  Next thing I know, the mayor's pinning a medal on me.  Picture in the paper, whole nine yards.
It's a fine line between insane and inspired.
Hey, Freud, what brand of bullshit are you shoveling, huh?  Right now he's probably dancing around his room in a pair of his mommy's panties, singing show tunes and rubbing himself with peanut butter...
We don't know for sure...
Him?
What?  Assessing fines?
They monitor reading habits.  Not every book, but certain ones are flagged.  Books about... let's say, how to build a nuclear bomb, or maybe Mein Kampf.  Whoever takes out a flagged book has their library records fed to the F.B.I. from then on.
Flagged books cover every topic the Bureau deems questionable... communism to violent crime.
Saint Thomas Aquinas.  He wrote about the seven deadly sins.
What happened?
You can't go in there.
We have probable cause now.
Sounds like a father who wanted his son to follow in his footsteps.
If we get him, I'll be happy enough.
You're the oldest man I know, Somerset.
People don't want a champion.  They just want to keep playing the lottery and eating hamburgers.
Oh, you're so much better than everyone, right?  No one's worthy of you.
He's only two murders away from finishing his masterpiece, right?  Can you even conceive of what's going to happen next?  I mean, can you even imagine how he'll try to finish it?
Too long.  What do you think so far?
If you can, please call me.  Please.  I have to go now... goodnight.
It's a hard place.
He mentioned it.
You should look into private schools.
I want to have children.  It's just...
Crime of passion.
Well, that's seven we can score up to your brother, Ethan.
Well, go get cleaned up and we'll proceed with the weddin'...
You're right sure you want to <U>jump</U> 'em, Ethan?
How many, would you say?
Why Colonel Greenhill is Colonel Greenhill, sir...Commanding Officer, Fifth U.S. Cavalry...I'm Lieutenant Greenhill, sir.
JOINT action?
They have done...nothing...They are my people...
I remember...from always...At first I prayed to you...come and get me... Take me home...You didn't come...
You help me find her, you got your rockin' chair...
A young buck fetched it in late last summer...  Said it belonged to a captive chile of Chief Scar...
Ain't yours yet.
If they're still alive...
Good night...
I always felt like she was...Her folks takin' me in, raisin' me like one of their own...
Yeah...you want me to know I ain't got no kin -- no money -- no horses -- nothing but a dead man's clothes to wear!..You tole me that already... Now shut your head!
Whatchu doin'?...
Scar?
What's the sense in it!
Cicatriz is Mex for <U>Scar</U>...an' he has a white girl in his tepee...Be seein' you...
He's got to...All these years, run- nin', dodgin', knowin' we were after him...Now we caught up...It's him or us.
It's what I'm countin' on.
I got your boy killed.
A little Comanche squaw - SQUAW!
Go on then! Pa's in the barn saddlin' the Fort Worth stud... an' you can take the light gelding with the blaze...
You do and I'll die, Martie...I will! I'll just die!
It's too late...She's a woman grown now...
I got to fetch her home...
Fetch <U>what</U> home?...The leavin's of Comanche bucks -- sold time an' again to the highest bidder?...With savage brats of her own, most like?...
You're not a doctor, you'll hurt him!
My father was an electrician. Already forgot that?
My father was a pilot.  And do I know how to fly?
We just have to make a new beginning.
If we stand a chance at all, it's only by sticking together.
Ellen, what are you trying to prove, anyway?  That we've created ourselves a ghost?  Come on!
Look at this!  The dog!  She's dead!
Old?!  Come look at this!  She has wounds.  Wounds on her head.  Like thrashes.  Or bites.
This house, the whole damned area around here is one mass grave... Now you might call me crazy, but there is something negative about the place.
...So he's dictating you a new bestseller?  Whatever that is, it's not our son.
You know, I saw him sitting outside your gate...  Oh, I'm sorry, I'm forgetting my manners again!  I haven't even introduced myself yet. Hi, my name's Lindner. Karl Lindner.
I guess someone lost their key. You did get your tetanus shots, I hope?
Thank you, Ned.
Not from me. I only stole it. When are you coming over to the Chamberlain's Men?
A comedy. All but done, a pirate comedy, wonderful.
It is like trying to a pick a lock with a wet herring.
She had a cottage. One day, she was three months gone with child, so
It's a comedy.
A new comedy. By Will Shakespeare!
Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter.
Good title.
I did not.
We are at least four acts short, Will, if you are looking for disaster.
By God, Will, if you do not, who does? Let us have pirates, clowns, and a happy ending, or we will send you back to Stratford to your wife!
Burbage says you have a play.
I hear you have a new play for the Curtain.
Good title.
"Of love?"
"Out of her favour where I am in love."
But I would be Valentine and Silvia too. Good Nurse, God save you and good night. I would stay asleep my whole life if I could dream myself into a company of players.
He looks well enough for a mountebank.
And I love poetry above all.
Why, Lord Wessex! Lost your wife so soon?
"Madam!"
Are you to be my muse, ROSALINE?
I am, Master Shakespeare.
No, no, a touch of cold only. We suspect he is lying but WILL has turned away.
"The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine."
A lowly player.
Oh, not for the world!
Answer me only this: are you the author of the plays of William Shakespeare?
Oh--no, no!
You follow your desire freely enough in the night. So, if that is all, to Greenwich I go.
Then I will go with you.
You cannot marry Wessex!
"It was the lark, the herald of the morn, No nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east. Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops. I must be gone and live, or stay and die."
and thus unable to declare her love
I don't know. It's a mystery
I do not love you, my lord.
I am going to church.
Are you Mr. Shakespeare?
Oh, Thomas, her lips! The early morning rose would wither on the branch, if it could feel envy!
Her chaperone. My lady's country cousin.  My, but you be a handsome gallant, just as she said! You may call me Miss Wilhelmina!
I don't know -- Campbell or something?
I'd like to ask you about your hobbies.
I was trying to educate you.
About what?
No.
All right, then, go ahead, telephone. Telephone the police. Try again. No one's going to stand in your way. Go ahead. Tell them there's a suitcase of money and you don't want it.
You're telling me you want out? Already? You're telling me you don't want the money? Hugo is going off. He smells. The flat smells. We can't wait any longer.
Is this necessary?
Yes. Now come on, all or nothing.
After.
Anyway, what I was wanting to say was this --
I beg your pardon?
Yeah, I'm sorry, but that's the way it is.
But there's no --
That's because he is. Does that upset you?
Tell you what. If you do remember seeing any of these guys, maybe you could give me a phone, on this number, any time you like.
Yes.
So tell me, Cameron, what on earth -- just tell me, because I want to know -- what on earth could make you think that we would want to share a flat like this with someone like you?
Maybe you should go, Alex.You'll meet someone wonderful.
No. Be someone else like him. One is enough. And what happened to that girl, that friend of yours, the one that came round. I liked her. I really felt we had something. She could have moved in. We had chemistry.
Well, she had problems --
-- instead of what he is --
So I gathered.
I will ask you once more, what sort of car --
Thats not a story, Alex. It's a corpse.
I don't thinkI can.
I don't want to. It's different.
OK.
I want my money back. Excuse me.
For ever and ever.
Then let's spend some money.
Looking after it -- he's probably fucking well eating it.
Exactly. Now I've been thinking --
Oh, good.
Oh.
You're frightened.
Alex.
What?
That's what I thought he said.
Burglary?
Yes, absolutely.
Someone lost the key.
Yes.
Do you smoke?
Sorry?
I'm boring?
You get the job done.
Which is why I'm trusting you with this account.
What happened to that guy?
Would you like to see the rest?
All right.
For what?
It's up to you. Air Patagonia. New outfit: via Caracas and Bogot . No catering. Four hundred and eleven pounds. Four one one. Good value, but refueling at Bogot  is variable.
Like recognizing criminals by their crimes.
Chicken salad, Devra!
Well, it's a small town. Sooner or later things catch up with you... don't they?
Maybe... why do you ask?
Lester, don't you think that uhh --
Yeah, I think so.
She did?
It turned out to be cancer.
I've gotta give her some pills. Percodan, she ran out.
I'll be back in a while.
I don't want to see you anymore.
I don't want to place you in any position --
I'm coming, baby --  How's Otis doing, anyway?
I've never been treated that way, and I'm not going to start now.
No, I know.
I know.
And who's Jill?
Don't be silly. I'll just tell Lester we were smoking a couple of joints. See?
Her?
It isn't?
No. You know too many sick ladies.
How do you expect to get anything done if you allow yourself to get sidetracked? Particularly in your business... you deal with women every day...
Well, are you? Are you queer?
Gee, this is great.
See if you've been making it with my mother.
Don't make conversation with me.
I never get my hair done.
No shit.
Yeah.
And you need money?
I guess not...
You're late, we're all backed up and you're supposed to go to Buffums.
Oh fuck, Norman!
-- Yeah... your car down here?
Great.
Yeah... wow.
You know what I'm talking about.
Hey, I don't tell.
You did, I know you did.
You're a genius.
-- what guy?
What about it?
-- we can't now.
-- look, you don't have to entertain me...
No --
I want to marry you. I want to take care of you and I want your children, and I want you to be my girl. That's all I want. That's all I want out of my life, and it's a lot.
So I'm saying it...
It's too late...
I don't know... Jackie?
What for?
No, man.
She touched it! Then she played in it and got it all into something else. Now I don't know what it is!
Yeah?...
I'm busy, man.
-- yeah, this is --
I guess you haven't heard from her yet.
That's too bad.
I just... who what?
Keep moving --
Okay, baby. Okay...
Egypt!
I already said hello.
Okay.
I'll call you.
A friend dropped me off.
Bullshit.
You didn't plan on fucking him tonight.
Let go of me.
You told him I was here and he wanted to know if I was beating you up.
Well, did you get a job out of it at least?
I'd like you to leave now.
Does it make you happy?
Stop it.
Yes, yes, I did.
Your hair looks -- well fabulous.
Yeah, I'm unhappy with you about something.
Sit down.
That's got nothing to do with it... You're so beyond my comprehension I can't even discuss it with you.
I know.
Yeah,, it goes up a little and then it goes down, maybe Nixon will do something. What's the difference, they're all a bunch of jerks. I wouldn't let 'em run my business, I can tell you that much. Not if I had any choice in the matter.  I don't know what to do with you. I don't know, I don't know what's right or wrong anymore.
I mean, how did that happen?
Lester, it just happened.
Just a whore, I go over there, have a few drinks and get my gun off. I'm through with her, she's nothing but a whore.
No, man, no. You can say everybody's a whore. She's okay. I mean Jackie'll fuck around but not that much. Somewhere she really likes you, Lester, and it's not just the bread. She's okay.
No.

A daytime soap opera.
Well, whatever I am, I think I can get you whatever you'd like.
Well, yes, George is a wonderful hairdresser.
Then you were talking to him.
I'm not jealous of the dogs.
Look... you do well for people, they don't ask you to stop. Nobody wants you to stop making money, doll, not even Uncle Sam. They all want their share.
Just a second, I've gotta clean this mess up or the dogs'll have it all over the house.
Yes, Jackie Shawn, my wi -- Felicia.
A real swinger. He's been trying to fuck me for about two hundred years.
I guess not.
I'm exaggerating.
How much?
What?
I would say so, yes.
-- Well it was very hot so I'd left the door open and the water was running so I didn't hear him come down the stairs...
What did you do?
But why Egypt?
Good for you.
Not with your hairdresser.
-- these bastards have me hemmed in.
Johnny!  Why didn't you tell me before?
Oh, say, how would you kids like to stop off for a drink?
Good.  I want you to have a good time.
Do you like this hotel?
I guess so.
Good.
Who's Tony?
Is Tony the one that tells you things?
Is there something bad here?
Hey, wasn't it around here that the Donner party got snowbound?
Okay...oh!
No.
Can I go to my room and get my fire-engine?
I won't, Mom.
No.
Yes sir.  Look um... I think the best thing is to come along to the gentlemen's room, sir, and eh...
Why no, sir.  I don't believe so.
A nigger!
Your son has a very great talent. I don't think you are aware how great it is, but he is attempting to use that very talent against your will.
Well, he is a very willful boy.
Will you indeed, Mr. Torrance.
This is Dick Halloran, our Head Chef.
Oh, that's just great.  How do you folks like our hotel so far?
Pleasure to meet you.
Your credit's fine, Mr. Torrance.
Your money's no good here.
It's not a matter that concerns you, Mr. Torrance - at least not at this point.
What time is it?
It's okay.  It's okay, now.  Really.
You think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?
Why?
Stay away...!
Stay away from me.
Stop swinging the bat.
Get down.
Go away.
Wendy...
Yes?
I'm Jack Torrance.
Well...
That's very good Jack, because eh... for some people eh solitude and isolation...
Well, my predecessor in this job
put off by the idea of staying alone in a place where something like that actually happened.
Jack is a schoolteacher.
Eight thirty.
Well, that still gives up plenty of time to go over everything first.
Let me help you up.
And the fireworks. Hand me that box, Marty.
It's just an outward symbol of everything that's inwardly wrong in this town. Not bad, huh? I read Sherwood Anderson in college. I can jive that shit all day.
What?
We're gonna find out. Take it down the road a ways and back. Be careful.
I called Peltzer on my way over here, Marty! Father Lowe came into the drugstore two days ago for a bottle of otic solution. That's a fancy way of saying eyewash. He's got a corneal inflammation.
It could have been anything, Marty.
Yes... you've always been that to him. But if you can't leave your booze in whatever dump you call home, you better just stay away.
Well... yes.  Yes it is.
You know what we're saying!
YES I'LL SING AND KNOW JOY EVERMORE
You know it.
You did what?
You said that?  And what did he say? Did he say you could leave her?  Did he say we'd be happy?
Is that why you came up here, Christy? To thank me?
I am sorry for all my sins.  And yours.
That used to be true, Vince.  I was with you.  But something happened.  And I'm different now.  Real--different.  I've had, well, you might call it -- a religious experience.  And I've got just two words for you.  And those two words are...
HE'S SO FINE.
But don't you get money?  From the Vatican?
Hold it.  Mary Patrick, you're a pretty cheerful person, aren't you?
This is so exhilarating!  All week long, I can't wait till Sunday, when we sing.
BUT THEN CAME AN ANGEL WHO WHISPERED THESE WORDS
You're a ringer.  She brought you in to replace me.  Out with the old.
Babies
A novice.
Initiation.  You understand.  Later on, we make her wear her underwear on her head.
Experience!
Mary Robert, I've watched you.  You never really sing.  You whisper. Nothing comes out.
Again?
You were unhappy?
Sit down.
Before we do, you might like to freshen up.  And you'll certainly want to change
A fast.  To remind us of the poor, of those who must endure without enough to eat.
It's like the Stone Age.  The room time forgot.  What about a phone?
What's wrong with my life?
I got it.
Do your recall the words of Saint Peter, in Ecciesiastes 1:27?  He spoke unto a wastrel youth.  He said, "Take up thy task, and know ye the path of contentment."
I don't believe we have anything to say to each other.
Mary Clarence, I have given you every opportunity.  To change.  To make a decent life for yourself.
No.  No.
You're my Olympic event.
Hold on.  That's not fair.  I worked hard with them.  They gave up their free time, and they loved it.  Those women are happy.  And we can get even better.  We can wake this place up.
A vote?
What?
I am sorry, Mary Clarence.  I seem to have misplaced my tambourine.  Good day, Mary Clarence.
But...
Good day.
He didn't do you a favor.
Okay -- no limo.
With nuns?  With rulers?  No way.  I'm gonna go back, work things out with Vince.
I can't stay here!  I'll crack up! Eddie, what am I gonna do?
Not again.  You can't keep calling. Somebody's going to catch on to where you are.
Don't call again.  It's not safe.  I'll be in touch.
She's counting on it.  She's concerned for your safety, but she wants me to try and find another convent that will take you. Or a carnival.
What if I was Vince?  You'd be dead right now.  What are you doing giving interviews on TV?
Listen to yourself.  This isn't a career opportunity.
I know that.  This isn't about me.  It's about the choir.  You should hear them. They're good.  Really good.  And I taught them.
Really?  Lieutenant?
I've been worried about you.
No -- worried about you.  Personally.
You re sort of... radiant.   your eyes are shining.  You're rea1ly different...
Even nuns have to pee.
People throw stones.  They call me names.  I mean, really.
Maybe. 
You were both supposed to put your guns to her head and shoot.
That's what I figured, too.
We're losing it.
Really...
Her whereabouts are unknown, and we must proceed without her.  Pull yourselves together.
She said they were from her old convent.
But where?
Can you hold?  Can you try?
She's acting weird, Vince.  Ever since we picked her up.
Okay, so the problem is still the nun outfit, right?
Well, unless your name is Baltus, you should not worry over mine.
Two days... ?  For murder?
I hit him square.
I say, is there any one person suspect in these acts?
When this cut was made, this person was already dead.  This is not Lady Van Tassel.
I cannot proceed without examining the previous victims.
Then, you should have left two days ago, because I have men willing to help me today.
Does that look like an animal hanging?
Are you a deist?  Is that it?  A free thinker who does not believe in divinity.
I am the Lord's voice in this town.
Yes, sir... but, do you have these?
Just so.  Granted.  And so you take your experimentations to Sleepy Hollow and catch the murderer who has tainted the place.  Bring him here to face our good justice. Will you do this for me?
Are you saying I should be frightened? Is this a message passed on from Clergyman Steenwyck?
We must discover it.  The reason the murderer chose these persons.
His teeth.  Someone had cut them and chipped off rotten pieces far back in his mouth.  The Lenape could not have done that for himself.  Someone out there cared for him.
Listen.
No crickets or cicadas calling.  No bird songs.
What happened?
Why this tree?
Yes.
Yes.  I rode with him on payment days.
No.  They are all missing.
What books?
Nothing.  To hell with this place and all the people here.
Are you so superstitious?
It was not butchery.
To avenge his father, and the others.
If it had been surgery on a living person, done to save that person's life, you would not question it.  Not for a moment.  So, let me be the first to tell you, dear girl... on the other side of these sheltering mountains, a whole world has advanced beyond such plebeian thinking as yours.  And someday, no matter how much you fear it, that world will come to roust Sleepy Hollow out of its slumber.
The skull is gone.
The loans give the land to your father. It does not matter survivors are still on their farms.  They could be thrown off... tomorrow... a year from now.
I do not know.  Away.
He moves too fast.
Yes, actually.
She has taken the last of our grain to be milled.  You do have a background in the medical arts, don't you, Constable?
Father saw you die.
All right then. I'll see you bright and early. How you comin' along on that garden tiller?
Well, I've got a roomful of work for him to do. Can't get Scooter to do any of it.
Okay, stop back by. Don't worry about your boy here, he's doin' good.
Give me the big'uns.
He'll be here in a little while, he's takin' me to get an ice cream.
Ain't that the sweetest thing. What am I supposed to do about supper with you traipsin' around with that fag?
Please don't. Not tonight. I'm not up for it. They always stay till mornin'. I'm just give out, Doyle.
That might be better than this.
Leave.
What do you want, hun?
What are you doin' with that damn hammer?
That ain't none of your damn bidness. Besides that's the way friends do one another. Fuck it, I'm gonna go call 'em. Honey, find my guitar, I think it's out there in the garage with that loony tune.
I know Albert. We're friends.
Different ones. The Bible's one of 'em.
Childers.
What numbers do you punch?
I reckon I feel all right.
You told me to come by.
I was kindly needin' to do some tradin'. Reckon they sell toothpaste?
I've had a lot of bad thoughts since my daddy died. Sometimes I wish I was still real little and he was still here. My mama's real good, but I wish I had both of 'em.  When we went to Memphis one time in the car, it was rainin' so hard we couldn't see the road. But I wadn't scared because I thought as long as daddy was drivin' nothin' could happen to us. I feel that way about mama now.  Mama has a boyfriend now. His name is Doyle Hargraves. He works construction so he makes a pretty good livin'. He still don't help mama out with any money though. He ain't no good. He's mean to her. He don't like me at all. Mama says it's because he's jealous I belong to my daddy instead of him. He stays with us all night sometimes, but he's got his own house. Somebody told me it's so he can still have other girlfriends. I like it on the nights when he ain't at our house. I'm not so nervous then.
I thought they was.
I growed up and got taught it ain't right to kill nobody.
Boy, folks sure had it rough back a long time ago, didn't they?
I was wantin' to ask you somethin'.
All right then.
Yeah, I recollect it.
I didn't know till here while back a year or two ago when I spent the night with Ronnie Smart one time. He said just tug on your peter and think about your mama. I tried it, but I felt funny thinkin' about my mama. So, I switched over to thinkin' about his mama and then what he told me would happen, happened. It sure tingles, don't it?
You don't seem like a daddy. You seem like a brother.  Wonder what makes you like somebody right off when you don't even know 'em like what happened with me and you.
Yeah.
I heared it cryin' a little through that box.
Seems like Doyle's wormed his way back in. Mama said he's stayin' over tonight and he's talkin' about movin' in for good. We ain't ever gonna be happy. We'll always be nervous, won't we Karl?
I feel sad about Karen Cross, too. I just make like to myself she loves me. I know better, though. It just feels good to me when I imagine it.
I'm glad of it you was borned.  I reckon I ain't gonna be there in the garage no more.
You're just a boy. You ort not to use that sort of language.
Hit don't make no difference where I was to be. We'll always be friends. There ain't no way to stop that.  I aim for you to have these books.
I aim fer you to have 'em.
Reckon what kind of a feelin'?
Ever'thing's okay, boy. I kindly want to put my arm around ye for a minute and then I'm gonna go on and leave here.
Did Karl go to bed?
I guess. He went to the garage. Poor thing, he's probably never seen such a crazy mess. He probably wants to go back and live in Mr. Cox's shop.
You better go get 'em.
Well, you can't do that. You're a free man. You've been let out to do as you please.
Well, you have to learn. It'll take some time. Don't you know anybody down there to help you out?
Listen, Karl, the truth is I don't know where they expect you to go or what they expect you to do. If it was up to me, I'd let you stay here if that's what you wanted. I'm just doin' my job.  You follow me?  Listen, I know an old boy that runs a fix-it shop deal down in Millsburg. He used to go to church with me. You're good workin' on small engines and things. If I put my neck out for you with him, will you work at it if he'll hire you?
I reckon.
My history.
Karl, this is my boyfriend, Doyle. Frank, why don't you and Karl go out in the garage and fix him up a place or play a game or somethin'. Vaughan, you ready to go?
Want to sit down? Did you need somethin'?
Just whenever you take a notion to. I don't aim to put you out.
I wouldn't mind a havin' supper.
I like Frank. He's a good boy. Me and him's made friends.
I believe you. I really do.
I reckon Mr. Woolridge got me hired on to work for Bill Cox's outfit.
I mean tomorrow or the next day.
I reckon I can stand to eat a little somethin' or 'nother at noontime tomorrow. Bill Cox generally gets me a box of french fried potaters. But I reckon he can lay off doin' it tomorrow.
Okay, I'll come by Mr. Cox's and get you at noon.
Well that's a very offensive way to put it. You shouldn't say that. You were taught that, weren't you?
I don't think he sees you as a guy guy.
Yeah.
His mother told him that he was their punishment. Hers and his father's; from God, for having sex--
Before they were married?
As much as anybody else is, I guess. Y'all have a good rest of the day now.
Yes.
No! At least I don't think I am!
And what are you, his chaperone?
I thought I recognized you. You're Paul Benjamin the writer, aren't you?
And your father? Is he from New York?
It's been a while. I thought maybe you'd be in touch.
What's the difference?
Hey, man. Good to see you. What'll it be today?
The boys and I were just having a philosophical discussion about women and cigars. Some interesting connections there, don't you think?
Yeah, that's what I'd recommend. You know how it is. Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow, time creeps on its petty pace.
Help? Hmm. It's possible. What did you have in mind?
Hey, kid. You interested in a job? I just got word from your employment agency that you're looking for a position in retail sales.
Fuckus my assus. They did some number on you.
That could be a good sign, though. It could mean that he got away.
It's Tommy's. The sucker owed me a favor.
That's a feather in your cap, man. The paper of record.
Every word.
Yeah, probably.
Talk away, lady of my dreams. I'm all ears.
Like what?
I know what it means. That still don't make it a good name.
I don't know who else to turn to, Auggie.
You weren't so lukewarm yourself. At least at first.
Fifteen years ago?  It won't wash, pumpkin. No mother waits fifteen years to tell a man he's a father. I wasn't born yesterday, you know.
Where to?
Anything, Auggie. Just name it.
I try not to, anyway. It's better for your health. I mean, look at you, Vincent. You're the guy with the wife and three kids and the ranch house on Long Island. You're the guy with the white shoes and the white Caddy and the white shag carpet. But you've had two heart attacks, and I'm still waiting for my first.
Speaking of which, are you still going ahead with that deal on the Montecristos?
It's all set. My guy in Miami said he'd have them within the next few weeks.  Are you sure you don't want to go in with me? Five thousand dollars outlay, a guaranteed ten-thousand-dollar return. A consortium of Court Street lawyers and judges. They're just drooling to get their lips around some genuine Cuban cigars.
Open it.
No, it's five thousand dollars.
Seventy-eight dollars. The girl who rolled these was probably wearing panties.
What does that mean?
I'm telling you. I don't know anyone named Thomas.
Rashid? Rashid! Is that what he told you his name was?
Well, whatever his name is, he's not here anymore. He left two days ago, and I haven't heard from him since.
Which brings me back to my original question. What was he doing here in the first place?
Has anything happened lately? Anything unusual or unexpected?
I figured he had a right to know.
You mean she just ran off with him and left her little boy behind?
Don't put words in my mouth. What I'm saying is she drove off in Cyrus's car and went to the Five-Spot Lounge with him for a drink. What I'm saying is that he imbibed too much in the way of alcohol and that when they finished their little talk three hours later and got back in the car, he was in no shape to drive. But he drove the car anyway, and before he could get her back to where she lived, the damn fool ran a red light and went straight into a truck. Louisa got thrown through the windshield and was killed. Cyrus lived, but he came out of it a cripple. His left arm was so mangled, the doctors had to cut it off. Small punishment for what he did, if you ask me.
Just passing through.
It was just a thought.
Benefits?
And have you mended them?
Hi there, little brother.
I don't know, Tommy. You think anyone gives a rat's ass about Kuwait? I read something about the head sheik over there. He marries a different virgin every Friday and then divorces her on Monday. You think we want to have our kids dying for a guy like that?
Twelve-eleven.  Twelve-twelve.  Twelve-twelve.
I can't believe I did that ... Christ. I'm walking around in a fog ...
Well, if you put it that way...
That's true. But I also owe you something, and I'm not sure that buying you a hamburger is going to do the job.  What is it? Family problems? Money problems?
The what?
Yeah, I can believe it.
Twelve, thirteen years ago.  Actually, he died with his sketch pad open on his lap. Up in the Berkshires one weekend, drawing a picture of Mount Greylock.
The world is going to end pretty soon if you don't learn fast.  Look, why not make yourself useful? I'm just about out of smokes.  Go around the corner to the Brooklyn Cigar Company and buy me two tins of Schimmelpenninck Medias. 
It just won't do, will it? I go two and a half years without being able to write a word, and then, when I finally get started on something, when it looks as though I might actually be coming to life again, you show up and start breaking everything in my house. It just won't do, will it?
I didn't ask to come here. You invited me, remember?  If you want me to leave, all you have to do is say so.
Do you need some money? Some extra clothes?
Take good care of yourself, okay?
Where the hell do you think you're going?
And?
I crossed paths with him. That's why I'm trying to stay clear of my neighborhood.  To make sure I don't run into him again.
Come on, just a little hint.
Excuse me for asking, but you aren't married, are you?
A lot of good it will do you if the Creeper finds you.
It was more complicated than that. There was a reason.
Well?
Yes, please.
Oh, yeh?
I'm a hemotologist, not a detective.
Did he see some <u>danger</u> from defen...
A thousand.
Now, how is Miyamoto gonna know in <u>advance</u>?  That Carl loses two batteries.  Must happen once ever' 20 years or so.
Your husband returned at, what, seven o'clock?
So, five hours.  Plenty of time for a call.  He was 'excited', you say. In the sense of being 'overjoyed'.
Up in the air?  Was <u>that</u> your reaction?
Easy.  Slow is best.
We're Japanese, not Mexican, Ishmael. He'll slice you up with a ceremonial sword.
I lie to my parents every day. And every night.
It'll be over soon.  I can get you money.
It was my specialty, sir, I trained several thousand over the years.
Could you tell me what 'kendo' is?
But even <u>after</u> you had an attorney.  You still claimed to know <u>nothing</u>.  Claimed <u>not</u> to have seen Carl. Am I correct?
Me and Smoltz came on dogwatch September 16.
No, night of the 16th, morning the 17th.  We replaced two guys named Miller and Milholland.
You ever been strangled by a single hand?
We have a warrant.  To search your boat.
He's done some on-the-spot refit- ting.  You could see the side flange was banged away to make room for the D-6.
Apparently.
I'm curious.  The D-6 that was refitted into the deceased's well. Was it exactly the same brand and model as defendant's?
The damage was considerable. But she's insured.  Thanks, again.
Sure, anything's poss...
Is it fair to say that you do not know for <u>certain</u> which it was.
Because I'm working the night shift - and I got a bottle of gin stashed away - and as soon as there's a lull -
All right, girls - from the top again.
A what?
They wouldn't be caught dead in Chicago - so we'll finish the job here.  Come on.
How can you be so selfish?  We owe back rent - we're in four eighty-nine bucks to Moe's Delicatessen - we're being sued by three Chinese lawyers because our check bounced at the laundry - we've borrowed money from every girl in the line -
We're not?
Jerry-boy - why do you have to paint everything so black? Suppose you get hit by a truck? Suppose the stock market crashes?
As far away as possible.
That's not far enough.  You don't know those guys!  But they know us.  Every hood in Chicago will be looking for us -
Shave our legs, stupid.
Must be the way their weight is distributed. Come on.
With those legs?  Are you crazy?
Oh, you don't have to worry about that.
I just want to make sure that honey stays in the hive.  There'll be no buzzing around tonight.
But suppose I lose?  Suppose it's an emergency?
Break it up, girls!  Daphne! Come on, help me!
You wouldn't hit a girl, would you?
They don't care - just as long as you wear skirts.  It's like waving a red flat in front of a bull.
But this is so humiliating.
Yeah?  Well, I'm your fairy godmother - and I'm keeping an eye on you.
Daphne -  Go on - tell me all about him.
And what are you trying to do to poor Sugar?  Putting on that millionaire act - and that phony accent -  Nobody talks like that!  I've seen you pull some low tricks on dames - but this is the trickiest and the lowest and the meanest -
Congratulations.  Who's the lucky girl?
Osgood proposed to me.  We're planning a June wedding.
Jerry, you'd better lie down. You're not doing well.
His mother - we need her approval.  But I'm not worried - because I don't smoke.
You're out of your mind!  How can you get away with this?
What?
Since when?  Usually you leave 'em with nothing but a kick in the teeth.
No tricks, no mirrors, nothing up my sleeve.  It's on the level this time.
Good night, honey.
That's ridiculous.
I'm a very sick girl.
Maybe I'd better go before I catch something.
We have some bourbon - lets make Manhattans.
What's that?
You're so flat-chested.  Clothes hang so much better on you than they do on me.
Neither can I.  Come on - lets go up to her room and tell her - right now.
That's it.  Something tells me she's going to walk through that door in a whole new outfit.
Yes.  He wants me to have supper with him - on his yacht - he's going to pick me up at the pier.
So this year, when George White's Scandals opened, she packed me off to Florida.  Right now she thinks I'm out there on my yacht - deep-sea fishing.
Well, pull in your reel, Mr. Fielding. You're barking up the wrong fish.
Sorry.  I'll be on the bandstand.
Oh, of course.  which of these instruments do you play?
Wanna bet?
Who?
You know something, Mr. Fielding? You're dynamite!
Sorry.
I forgive you.
And I can never have children.
But you don't understand!  I'm a MAN!
Oh, it's you!  You got a lot of nerve -
Good!  Then you won't be needing your car.
Nellie, get me long distance.  What is it?
William Morris!
We'll take it!
You two from the Poliakoff Agency?
All right - lets take it from the top. And put a little heat under it, will you?
Oh.
Then why did you take this job?
I want mine to wear glasses.
Not at all.
What else?  And was I ever crazy about him. Two in the morning, he sent me down for knackwurst and potato salad - they were out of potato salad, so I brought coleslaw - so he threw it right in my face.
Just my feminine intuition.
Would you mind moving just a little? You're blocking my view.
Certainly not.  with all that unrest in the world, I don't think anybody should have a yacht that sleeps more than twelve.
Well, I'm not.
Good school!  And your family doesn't object to your career?
- Inauguration balls -
- and always the same Four Hundred.
I only come ashore twice a day - when the tide goes out.
Please - no names.  Just call me Junior.
If it's at all possible -
Shell Oil, Junior.  He's got millions - he's got glasses - and he's got a yacht.
You don't say!
It's not how long you wait - it's who you're waiting for.
I wanted them to fly down some orchids from our greenhouse but all of Long Island is fogged in.
It's sort of funny - you being out of gas - I mean, Shell Oil and everything -
Just regulation size.  We have three like this.
Down the hatch - as we say at sea.
I'll say.  I had two ponies drowned under me.
They just sort of leave me cold.
Not anymore.  I was in love once - but I'd rather not talk about it.  How about a little cold pheasant?
Oh, no!
You poor, poor boy.
I have.  Spent six months in Vienna with Professor Freud - flat on my back -  - then there were the Mayo Brothers - and injections and hypnosis and mineral baths - if I weren't such a coward, I'd kill myself.
From a rich millionaire.
Tomorrow night?
Quite a while.  As a matter of fact, I'm not coming back at all.
I told you - I'm not very bright.
Do yourself a favor - go back where the millionaires are - the sweet end of the lollipop - not the cole slaw in the face and the old socks and the squeezed-out tube of toothpaste -
Show the gentleman to the chapel - pew number three.
Booze.
Sorry, sir, we only serve coffee.
Go where?
Big joke!
What's his first name?  And where does he live?
That's very refreshing. Now what's the password?
Thanks, Charlie.
If you want a ringside table, tell 'em you're one of the pall bearers.
Exactly! Today’s my day. Tomorrow will be my day. And the day after that? My day.
It’s not me. I swear. It’s her. She’s magic.
Why, with you.
My mother has a rule about men and women sleeping in the same room without a ring in the picture. She thinks it’s--
I’m not as square as my daughter thinks.
Oh, no.  She tells this story at every major holiday.
Mom, please.
You are taking the piss?
Don’t be ridiculous. It’s late and the place is empty. Just take my car.
There’s something about him that’s just a bit odd.
No, that’s not it.
It was before you started going out. We had lunch at that inn on the lake.
That’s when I realized I wanted to be a doctor.
Hello, Katmandu.
Let me guess. Amy presumed I’d forget the rings.  I think I’m her least favorite person.  You know, I am sorry.
It was. And it took your sister getting married to get you back here.
I don’t do naked. My sister? She does naked.
Why?
Graham Russell and Russell Hitchcock.
A wedding.
This happened to you?
If I was going to charge you, I would have told you beforehand. I thought I explained that.
I just hate seeing you so stuck.
There was something in your voice on the phone that day.
Sure. You’ve got to play them against each other. Otherwise they think you’re easy.
I wasn’t saving you from him. I was saving you from yourself.
I heard you were back in town, kitty cat. You’re here for the highland flings, I bet.
Of course, don’t be silly.
It’s complicated, Dad.
Then for once in your life, do something for yourself.
Will do.
Uh huh...
Don't you teach in your school 'bout folk who ain't dead?
You know, that was a good thing you did for Clarence, in class today. I believed his story, but I was afraid the other children wouldn't...
You oughta be tired, too, Sounder. That possum shore whipped the hell outta you tonight!
Yes, sir -- I learn to write a little bit, and I can read a lot--
Hi to you, son...
Why, Daddy; you won't be here?
They gone to the field...
September 4 -- how far away is that?
And I wanta be with you, too, but this school is somethin' that's good for you -- somethin you need, like good air to breathe, and I want you to have it, boy, and that's the way it's gonna be!
Never heard of 'im. We gotta lotta men here...
Will you help me to find out what camp they sent my father to?
David!
Goodnight.
Where did it come from, Mama?
You sure can, son...
He'll be all right, Mama. I'll make him all right.
No, ma'am...  Mama, I wanted Mrs. Boatwright to find out where Daddy is, so me and Sounder can go see him.
So did I. I figured when the time got right, we could all take a day or two and walk up there, but it's not the kind of long trip for a child to take alone.
It's the heat.
I'm used to it.
He said, I don't know, Ike -- you doin' better'n me, I been tryin' to git in there for 200 years and ain't make it yet!
Any time it's Saturday and I don't hafta do any work, I'm doin' okay!
Seems this piece of mail came to Mr. Howard's place this mornin' and he had me to bring it over here.
Maybe soon--
The season is a long way off, Mr. Howard, and by that time, Nathan oughta be home. If he ain't, believe me -- the children and me -- we will grow the crops. We have to because we owe you all that money -- Mr. Howard.
Is that a blessing, Reverend?
You gotta low-life job, mister sheriff!
What... are you?
NO WAY, DUDE! I'VE LOOKED ALL OVER FOR YOU, AND NOW YOU HAVE TO TELL ME HOW TO GET WENDY TO LIKE ME!!
How would you like to go to the principal's office?
Chef, do you know anything about women?
Sheet!
Okay.
'Cuz, dude, it's all sticky and airy and fragile and stuff. I fucking hate it.
I have to say 'behind'! I get shocked if I say 'ass-  OW!!!
But mom!  I'm not fucking addicted to fucking bad language!  I don't have a fucking problem!
Oh, I don't care, I was just asking cuz all my favorite TV shows have been replaced by news and it's pissing me off.
Yes, hon?
Uh, except for you Eric. I'm afraid you need to work more on not saying the F word and the N word.
It's... It's not good children.
Mph rmph rm rmph rm.
Oh, you want out of hell, huh?
You boys need help.  There are rehab centers that specialize in treating people with chronic addictions to bad language.
KYLE BROVLOFSKI, YOU WATCH YOUR LANGUAGE!!
Okay.
No. Zey must have zem inside. We will have to dig.
She's not my girlfriend, dude!
Yeah, let's swear we won't tell!
Our moms suck!
Totally!
Dude, I found the clitoris! I think I can get Wendy to like me now!
What about air strikes?
We have to have air strikes on their military and entertainment centers.  It's the only way to ensure that their smut can't reach American soil!
What the hell is going on?!
Terrance and Phillip are two VERY untalented, unfunny actors from Canada. Their TV show is filled with toilet humor and bad language and is just complete garbage.  Now it appears they have a movie and I'm positive it's not suitable for children!
Well, it looks like I'll have to send a warning letter out to parents. I have to put a stop to this before MORE children see 'Terrance and Phillip'.
Then we'll have to resort to plan B and call the v-chip organization.
I sure did, Phillip!!
Hello, Brooke Shields!
Hey fella!  Relax!  This whole armageddon thing has got you all stressed out. Let's make love.
THAT'S IT!  I HAVE HAD ENOUGH!!!!
Stan?! YOU started La Resistance?
My friend the clitoris told me.
<b>Knew it in a word Saw it in a glance The only thing I think I'd die for</b>
You're Warren Wayne.
I'm sure I will.
Well, I guess she figures she's paying for it.
Sounds like you've been talking to Mac too much.
It's steady, good benefits.
What is the condition of the bridge?
Well don't drag your ass.  There won't be much of a window for us to link up.  We'll be in your orbit trajectory in less than two hours.
Let's get something straight, Chappy!
That's clear.
Well...I don't mind.  I can put up with it.  I'm taking six months off after this, and I won't have to deal with people snapping their fingers at me.
Well I don't think there's a chance of that happening.  It's usually the moon walks.  Sometimes you feel like a kindergarten teacher.
Well maybe we can do something like that.
With what?  How am I going to interface with it?  I need to be able to talk to the system and to have the system talk to me.
What do you think's going to happen to us?
Words to live by.
A schematic of the ship.  Looking for a lifeline to the pods.
Why?  Where are you going?
Hurry.  You have to get them out of there!
So what's going to happen to you?
Hopefully sooner than later.
Is there anything I can help you with?
No, just enjoying the view.
Ah hell we can always do that. Listen believe me, once we get to the moon, your tone is going to change.
Talk to him...Jesus...
Alteration of my central processing unit should be done only by an authorized service dealer.
One moment please...  one moment please...
That's affirmative.
I'm from Akron.
He's my dad.
- canker sore.
Right, eating at the core, eating it's way out. It makes me sick!
Wait! That's an aria!
I'm sure you have Buzz.
They suspended me for 100 years.
I need a sponsor to get my sanction card back. Where I come from, you're the king.
My mom was there. She told me about it. The 'Fazeli Split.'
You shouldn't listen to her, she's a nervous old Nellie.
Theo! This is Sheila Kastle, my partner's daughter.
I had a career. She wanted a little bowler of her own. Sid and Breeze leap into the fray, prying the two men apart. They wrestle Theo against a wall, pressing his face into the tiles.
I'm getting to like it here.
Did that porcupine say he'd get you back on the tour?
You never even took the shot. You couldn't do it. Theo moves towards Buzz in a threatening manner.
What about bowling?
I'm goin' straight. No more short cuts. Theo gets into the car. Buzz leans in the open window.
I looked in his car. He's got pictures of you, clippings, maps.
You sure you're OK Teddy? You're not bowling are you?
It feels good to let it out, doesn't it? Sheila leans over and whispers furiously to her father.
I don't want to play.
It's not an "Alley". I hate when people call it a "Bowling Alley", it's so common! I prefer "Bowling Center".
No!
You know who I am?
Nobody sticks a finger into a bowling ball in this town without Miles Kastle knowing about it. You don't mind if I have a word with Theo, do you bunny? Kastle takes Theo by the elbow and pulls him away.
I think Buzz is retiring soon. In fact, I think he's retiring tonight. Kastle pulls out a shiny gold credit card and holds it in front of Sheila.
That's why Mom ran away, because you had to control everything!
She ran away to be with that...  that Motocross champion.
I'm sick of you people. Why don't you leave him be?
Where can I find him?
The Peter Pan.
Mine, and they never tip.
The mental hospital.
What does he do?
He follows me, he tries to have sex with me, and then they send him to the nut-hut for a while and then he gets out and then he follows me, he tries to have sex with me, they send him to the nut-hut for a while...
I'd rather you didn't.
Unfortunately what he wants is you.
Why were you suspended?
So you're hoping Buzz can get you re- instated?
What's plan B?
Ha! And what do you have to do for him?
How much would you charge me for the lips?
Are you fucking with me Sheila? Is something gonna happen to Buzz? Sheila seems to be trying to tell Theo, but is unable.
Did you - kill him?
I've been trapped by Miles Kastle my whole life. She walks over to her scooter, and mounts it.
SSHHEEIILLAAA!
Basement bingo?
Breeze, give him his ball back!
Dwarf bowling's illegal.
Basic English?  There's no way this spacecraft was constructed on our planet.
What if it attacks?
Do it, Norman, it's the only choice we have.  This thing is gonna crush us.
Captain.  Right, forgive me.
The Pentagon?  I didn't know I had friends in Washington.
They didn't tell me anything.
-- there's got to be some mistake here -- a four hundred year old military spacecraft?  There's no such thing... our space program isn't even forty years old.
What?
I don't know.  That's the point.
All I'm saying is, someone should keep an eye on him.
So you knew this when you wrote your report?
-- I didn't know it would come to this --
-- without a cautionary word to anyone.  You know, Ted said something to me earlier.  I think he's right.  He said, "When you got a guy who -- if he wasn't here -- he'd be standing in the unemployment line, you gotta question if you got the right guy."
Maybe so.  But I think we need to ask Jerry about it.
Jerry?  Please.  Stop this.
Pull it.
Working on it now, sir.
Nothing.  I don't know.  Everything was normal.  No changes at all.
Fuck him.  What?  Hello?
Well, where the fuck is he?
If the subs aren't here yet, sir --
In a minute, sir.
Yes, Harry.
A break for what?
I have to tell you.  It's strange.
Radiation shield, you think?
A foot and a half thick?  That'd withstand a helluva lot of radiation.
Sir, about leaving --
Underwater?
Well, you must have realized the chances an encounter like this would happen here.  In the ocean.  70 percent of the earth's surface is water, Norman.  That's first grade geography.
No, thank you.  I hate jellyfish.
They have six tentacles.  A new species.  And the squid too.  They had no stomach.
And you didn't tell anyone?
Beth.
In Edmunds' things.
I have to reset the sub.
I would.  But my suit --
My air isn't... I'm coming back.
What are you doing in the ship?  Beth?
I think so, Beth.  Yes.
All I know is I opened that refridgerator --
Page 87.  "I could never read that far."
Created.  Brought to life.  I don't know.  But at the end, Jerry said, "Stop calling me Jerry".  And --
I don't know.
Sintag.
Parasolutrine?
Causes sleep.
I'll just boost the doses.
For what?
Are you?
You put explosives around the habitat, I can't imagine what you'd put in a drink.
You know what I mean.
You think I manifested the snakes?
You think I'd belive you?  Believe anything you might say now?  After you lied to me about telling Barnes about my past.  About my problems.  My problems.  Not yours.  Not his.  Mine.
Get away from the door, Beth.
Leave me alone, Norman.
Oh please, don't shrink me, Norman. Not now.
Hear what?
I never said that.
We never even had a conversation, Norman.
Won't make any difference.  The tapes document everything.
What?
Don't be defensive.
Whatever I can do to help.
Not a clue.
No.  I didn't say that.
What is it, Harry?
What happened to her?
What do you mean?  She's not here?
Help me lift her.
I'm trying to keep balance with --
We all kill ourselves?  Bad joke.  Sorry, Beth.
Just one of Norman's many secrets.
Unless, this alien spacecraft was -- you know -- somehow presenting itself to Americans in a way that would make us feel comfortable.
Meaning?
It's not a discharge.  Right, Edmunds?  You said before, right?  So it's gotta be a message.
Yeah, I'll work on it, too.
You mean they haven't told you yet?
Told me what?
Well, everybody's been talking about that report you wrote.
Sure, why not.  Give him the trophy. That pretentious son of a bitch.  You heard him, Norman.  All that "someone went to a lot of trouble, try again" bullshit.  And "impotent".  Where does he get off saying I'm impotent?  He's a fucking self-righteous, little prick.
When he uses a phrase like "I am Happy", I think we should think twice about what we ask him.
I'm not sure.
Who's going to pay me then?
It's not good... unless I could find the Crystal.  Then it could be very good.
I know that.
But you must!  I can't do it alone. I'm not at all like my father.  I'd never make it.
I already know you think you're worthless.  I recommend you learn to think of yourself in a better light, for what you believe you are is what you become.  I haven't been involved in anything like this for many years.
Yes.  It was a black day.  One of my disciple's took the crystal and became a Sith Lord.  It was a black day.  The few crystals that remain are in the possession of the Sith Lords on Alderaan.  That's how they've become so powerful.
Like Bogan weather, or bogan times. I thought that was just a saying.
All you have to do is lose your thinking self.  Don't focus on anything.  Let your body do your thinking... You have to learn to act on what you feel, not what you think ... If I had the crystal, it would be much easier.  You could feel the Force immediately... but for now, let yourself go.  You'll pick it up... and someday you'll have no need for that pistol either.
Yes, your highness. I'll let you open it then.  It won't be too long before they figure out what happened to us.  This has turned into a brilliant escape!
We captured the plans in a raid on the Imperial shipyards, but we fell under attack before I could get the data to safety, so I hid it in this Artoo unit and sent him off.
Where are you taking us now anyway?
I have little time for your mercenary concerns, but I am grateful for the service you have given to our cause.  What is your price?
Move out of the way!
Come back here... Where are you going?
The... ah door's jammed.  Give us a few minutes to get it fixed.
It appears your ship had an accident. I will see to it that your death is duely reported.  There will be no one to save you this time.
Thank you, sir.  I'm See Threepio, Human Cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo Detoo.
Several, I think.  There is not much to tell.  I'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories, not at making them interesting anyway...
Threepio!  Shut down all garbage mashers on your level... Do you copy?? Threepio, shut down all garbage...
Hey, don't laugh. Everyone oughta have a friend like me !
Bye ! Write me ! I'm gonna kill you guys !
Sir, yes, sir. Breckinridge reported a helmet malfunction, and I asked him to show it to me, sir.
Eight point... no, uh, seven...
Bugs laid a trap, didn't they ?
Yeah, we know each other from the game. No hard feeling, eh, chum ?
Maybe not. I heard about this crazy girl coming through the academy, solid math, a little wild on the stick, but a natural. When it turned out it was you, I made sure we'd run into each other...
Oh, yes, sir. Vector ?
Don't change the subject. Am I right ?
That girl who died on the way up ...his girl ?
How do you feel about him now ?
It wasn't luck. Rico ignored the mission objective to rescue you...
I have good reflexes.
Well, at least you didn't lose your lunch over a bug. How embarassing.
Why won't you kiss me when we're all alone ?
Carl can wait.
Johnny, my Dad's home today.
Sometimes I do what I want, eh ?
How do I know if this is love ?
I'm glad you're doing so well. If they haven't made you squad leader by now, I'm sure you will.
That was just a mix up.
Ibanez...LET'S GO !
Just throw me the ball, Diz.
You are. I joined up to get out on my own. And you had to tag along.
Flip six, three hole.
If they didn't want you, they woulda kicked you out, amigo.
Hey, they humiliated me in front of everyone ! I'm just supposed to take it, huh ? Well, I'm not gonna, and I guess that proves I just can't cut it.
That you don't have what it takes to be acitizen !
All bands.
Johnny, why won't you change your mind ? Does citizenship mean so much to you ?
I'm eighteen. It's my decision.
It's not really working out for me here, dad. I was thinking... I was hoping it would be alright if I came home.
AAAAAAAAAAA !
Sir, yes, sir !
Aw, don't get mushy.
Uh, no.
You heard me. Wanna make something out of it, private ?
Saddle up, boys, that's our trash !
Inside 4th brigade compound ? That's crazy !
What is it, Rico ?
I'm not interested in nostalgia, Rico, I need a corporal. You're it until you're dead or I find someone better.
Yes, sir !
Is V'ger the Captain of the alien vessel?
Because V'ger is going to destroy all the carbon units on the third planet.
Enterprise should not require the presence of carbon units.
V'ger is announcing that it has arrived, sir -- that it's ready to deliver the information it was programmed to collect...
Spock...!  Get a fix on his position!
You are what...?
Thank you, sir. I'm sorry I embar- rassed you.
Mr Decker....
You asked my opinion, sir.
I'm afraid our hand is pretty weak, Captain.  But it's the only game in town.
It's a programmed <U>mechanism</U>, Mr. Spock...
Unidentified small object has been pulled into the wormhole with us, Captain! Directly ahead...!
Our Exec and Science Officer...
Starfleet, boost your matter gain; we need more signal!
I know this has been painful, Spock. For me too. Thank you.
Communicated with us <U>how</U>?
But they understood our messages; they broke off the attack.
Delay that order, Scotty...! Disengage all main drive systems!
No, Captain, not for us... for V'ger.
I'll walk you home, you can have my coat.
Actually, I'm not sure if I quit.  I think that I got fired.  I'm such a liar. I never could tell the truth.
It's in your play.
But why the dalmation?
For example, he's just come back from a <u>fire</u> and he...um...  That's a fine house.  You look at that, and you know, there's nice people that live there.
That's why you didn't want to take the <u>Mill</u> out...you've...
<u>How</u>...?
Cast stood me up.
You going to ask me in?
Read the card.
Oh.
Why?
...because if you don't, they die...
I used to go out with a politician.
That's...that's <u>exactly</u> what it's about. Take...
...what...?
I saw...
If I go to jail...?
Drama Group?
Oh.  What were you doing, then, that's so important that you shouldn't call your fian...
I'm sorry.
Why, you <u>whore</u>!
That's what they call an events cluster. Some guy, nobby orders a Manhattan, fifteen, twenty years, allasudden, three times inna night.
Hi.
Uh -- why did we have to leave New Hampshire?
I'm bleeding, Bill, I'm <u>bleeding</u>...
What is that in fingers...?  Just kidding, get me this horse.
Tell the guy, get me the horse, I'll give him an Associate Producer credit.
Look:  Okay.  Okay.  Look:  look you're driving, countryside, so on, you picked her up, she was hitch...
I <u>know</u> my lines...
Nothing happened.
How'd you like working with Richard Hill?
I loved it...he...
Thanks, honey, but, next time, bring two, save yourself a trip.
The people came to see a motion <u>Picture</u>.  ...hold on...
What...
And you go start with <u>that</u> stuff in <u>this</u> town...
Everybody needs a hobby.  Okay, look Page...
Joe, the writer?
...I have to give you this <u>ticket</u> for damage to city property.  I'm really sorry, Sir, it's a formality, I hope you'll excuse...
There's other things to be learned.
Look, look, I like you <u>very much</u>...
Who is that...?
I...
I just...
Yes, but, Joe, <u>Joe's</u> been, well, he's just been having a few, uh, "Thoughts," about...
This scene is why I'm doing the movie. "Look at the mill, Frank -- look at the way it goes around...<u>half</u> of the time the darned wheel's under water, but..."
"...but still it rises up...It rises up, Frank, high as it can go."
...and, and, and did she...?  And she did the seven shows...
...yes...
...she has a <u>home</u>...
...he's right here, Mr. Mayor...
Did she throw up?
Her religion bars her from fulfilling her contr...
<u>Did</u> I?  I think you're mistaken.
I, uh...I'm leaving.
Moral turp...you're on my home court, friend, I have the Mayor and the town behind me, and forget making your movie: I may own the studio when I get through with you: I got a civil suit, I got rape, I got collusion...
Okay...
I'd prefer it if you didn't speak to me.
How about that.
I had a witness I would.
Who's White...?
I...
We're very upset with her.  Get someone to <u>double for her</u>, her tits, the tits scene, call L.A.  I want to see some <u>pictures</u> of the women's <u>tits</u>.  Of their <u>tits</u>.
My <u>wife's having a baby</u>...
I...
You built an Old Mill in New Hampshire...
Um, no.
...she keeps her back to the camera...?
To the contrary.  I want you to tell the truth.  The truth is, you can't tell me, to a certainty, that you saw the thing.  You don't remember, a gun to your head, which glasses you have on.  And you have a fertile imagination.  Imagination wants to fill in the blanks.  Now.  If you aren't <u>sure</u>, then they have nothing.  Bob walks free.  As he should.  Joe:  wasn't long ago they buried actors at the crossroads with a stake through their heart.  You know?  The people who are talking to you about the way we live though we may praise them, we fear them. And they fear us.  Because we tell the truth.  About our lives.  Now, this is a damn roust, and everyone knows it; the guy is looking for a case, he wants to make a name for himself.  If we let him do that, if we let him do that, then we're being false to our community...to our community, you understand...?  To our world.  Cause you are a part of that world, now.  You have to take off the Steel Rolex and put on the Gold Rolex.  And be part of your world.  I got a five picture deal with the studio.  And you stick with me.  You write one, two more, you stick with me, and you'll <u>direct</u> the third one.  You are a part of this world. It's in your blood.  It's you.  You have to do the right thing:  we're out in the Provinces, the Sheriff, <u>literally</u> is at our door.  You have to stand with the troops, Joe.  That's the bottom line. You <u>have</u> to...if you had the leisure to think it through, you'd see it for yourself.  The girl wasn't in the car.
I don't getcha.
I treated you like a son or nephew.
The girl was in the car.
It's lovely.
We're flying over pigs, we're flying over <u>sheep</u>...
That's why I <u>want</u> it.  Type it up and get it back to me in...
I don't got the money.
Here it is: Statutory r...Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah..."statutory"..."unsupported testimony by the..."  Hold on, Bobby...  You've got nothing, and you know it.  By God, you know it.  Harassment.  You need a...Even if this was true, you need a witness.  You need someone puts her in the car, and you've got nothing.  Now we all have...yes, give her that part in the film.  Yes, we'd love to have you...Now: we all have more important things to do, isn't that right...?
You tell me what to do, I'll do it.
Sherry, Sherry...
My golly, you know?  All my life I grew up in the city, but every summer...would you like a cigar?
<u>Whatever</u> you need.  The City Council, of course, has to pass on your...
Zat true?
...we can't lose the wind...
Because they gots a window with a dogs in it.  You want me to "push in."  Or I can lose the shot.
No you can't lose the shot.  The meaning of the <u>film</u> <u>is</u> in that shot.
I NEVER do that, you ALWAYS lie!
I hate the crayon Burnt Sienna and people who spit when they walk.
I hate when you say that.
Annabelle, daddy and I will always be there. That's one time always is always.  You can call him after dinner but...
I'll ride ahead.  Nelson, protect the Queen...
Why does Rachel scream?
What are you gonna talk about?
Then why are you putting on mascara?
Or blush.  You look pale.
Secret's safe with me.
Where's Rache?  It's <u>Thursday</u>, we get to be with <u>Rache</u>!
I call him a fartface or a pervert, or something equally lame.
Oh, yeh.
Now could she just...<u>forget</u> me!
That's so weak.
June 3rd, God willing, I'll marry your Dad.  And then I <u>will</u> be your stepmom. And right now, I'm not looking forward to th...
...laughed, yeh.  They laughed real hard.
No, <u>his</u> mother's always on time.
That's my girl...
&quot;And a picture of the cow jumping over the moon...&quot;
IT'S YOUR GIRLFRIEND, BIG GUY, OPEN UP.
Yes...if you like big hair...
Mommy?
What honey?
Where are you, anyway?
I have cancer.  Do you know what that is?
How do you know?
At first.  Then, after awhile, some chemo.
We don't KNOW if you've got it, we haven't SEEN it yet!  Now go back and FINISH!
You think I didn't get that?
They want to be with you Luke, they go to your house to be with their father.
At the Big Apple Circus, it's the only big top I know.  I <u>said</u> I'd get 'em back tonight...
Not to me.
Annabelle showed me the new dress. She's amazing in it.
Stop.  You're making me insecure.
Yet another spaghetti night.
A lot smaller.
This is Friday, her riding lesson is on Tuesdays.  I got it right here...
You mean for you.  A 10-year-old girl is coping with the fact that her father is never coming back to live with his family.  She sees her father naked with another woman for the first time. And you think it's best for her if every- one pretends it didn't happen?  This isn't going to work out.
Ben likes to be read to.  Do you know Dr. Seuss...?
Do you have a word limit you need to hit every day or can I finish?
Anxiety.
Nobody likes a snoop.
You're not dying.
Right.  Which is the whole <u>point</u> of this 'going out' thing, so one of them can dump the other one, and they can imitate the whole passionate adult soap opera tragedy, without ever having to actually date.
Yeh, she's...I'll get you Ben first, it's past his bedti...
It was just a job, there'll be plenty of others.
So you became the hero.  And I became the schmuck.
You weren't passing 'em out.
She wasn't steering her own course, she was steering <u>yours</u>.
No, there isn't.
Uh.  You hate my guts?
You'll learn.
You'd rather spoil our walk home.
I can take them to work with me -- I can shift things around --
But?  But what?
They don't hate you --
And what you're telling them is keep hating her -- keep up the good work --
It's complicated for Jackie.  It's complicated for me...You don't have kids -- you don't understand --
Oh right...So it's just complicated for you and Jackie -- for me it's pretty simple cause I just don't understand...
You took a fishing trip with the boys. Liked it so much, you took another.
That's not us.
Does Jackie know this?
Hmmm...Do I know any...personally...?
But that could've happened to him. Or to me, if I'd been alive. Or you.
Be your sidekick, you know, and maybe eventually become a TV talk- show host.
TV talk-show host, OK. You were at sidekick eight seconds ago, then TV talk-show host. You'll be a Latin dictator in a bout a minute.
Really? How many?
I'm always working.
Who is Jesus?
It is when you love someone, and they don't love you. And then you do something about it.
Yes, I know…But still, it should be somewhat entertaining.
I mean, without this footage, without this rigorous documentation, it would feel like exploitation.
You've got a family tragedy on your hands. Will you tell me what's funny about that? About a kid in a coma?
Nothing, I guess…
We're not ready!
I don't know. Maybe they'll like it.
Of course, honey. Come in bed with us. Come on.
Maybe he's building a bomb...just like-!
Say, 'Nigger.'
Nigger.
Again!
Nigger, fuck me hard!!...
Again!!
Well, I mean...I wanna be on TV. Maybe have a talk show or something. Like Conan. Or early Letterman.
I dunno. See if I have any connections.
Toby -? Oh, hi! How are you?
So what's going on?
Anything I might know about?
Well, um, I kind of let things go on this novel I'd been really into - I mean, the whole publishing industry is totally corrupt. I mean, really, it's finished.
Hunh.
Yeah. But not any more.
Three.
Maybe she has caller ID.
I mean...
Thanks man.
Well, I-I hope that--that--
Why? Are we going dancing?
We don't have time!
What do you think?
By the time I got back to the party our ambassador was face-down, in a bed of bloody azaleas.
Yes, you should.
I said I don't want any, goddammit!
Good.
We have a special forces squadron out of Thailand surrounding the compound as we speak.
I'll let the senator tell you.
The ball is in Richter's court.  But we're sure as hell not going to sit on our hands while he assassinates people--we're gonna stop the son-of- a-bitch!
I assure you gentlemen if we had something of that magnitude it wouldn't be shelved in a lab somewhere...
Well, it's a binary formula--a precise amount of two separate chemicals must be exposed to the nitrogen in the atmosphere simultaneously for it to work.
Are you hungry?  We can discuss some final arrangements over some slop in the galley.
Well, there was uh, a little dissent about the amount of the bonus--
You know, when we reach Kompong Som--
Certainly - how about some breakfast?
If he's not there, try...  87 - 43 - 56.
That's nonsense, and you know it!
What do you think of this, Mister President?  I told you we shouldn't let him in here.
Then all you have to do is untrigger it.
Don't worry, Major.  Your rights will be fully protected.
Ceida Pietraszkiewicz.
General Schmuck, we monitored a trans- mission about six minutes ago from Burpelson Air Force Base, HQ 843rd Wing.  It was apparently directed to their Wing on air- borne alert.  It decoded as - Wing attack, Plan-R.
Buck, when I told you to give them right up to the top, you said we couldn't insult a general officer by asking him to pass a test to see if he's a psycho.
Under a condition red alert, the base will probably be sealed off and defended by the base security troops.
This is General Ripper speaking.
Certainly, General.  Why do you ask, sir?
Condition Red!
That's right.  I want this flashed to all section immediately.
I understand, sir.  Nothing comes or goes without your personal say-so.
No, sir.  Plan-R to be radioed to the Wing.
That's right, Major.
Well, sir, I was thinking, if an enemy attack is in progress, how come the radio's still playing music?  It's supposed to go off, and all we should hear are Civil Defense broadcasts.
And if that were true?
But -- why...that would be an awful thing to do, sir.
You're damned right they are.
I see.
You see, Major, at this very moment, while we sit and chat, a decision is being made by the President in the War Room.  He knows that the enemy will pick up our planes on their radar in about twenty minutes.
But when they do, sir, won't they hit back with everything they've got?
Go on, Major.  You fascinate me.
Well, I'm not, sir.  Honestly, sir.
And you'd like to see that?
General, what's good enough for the President and all the experts he's got working on the thing, is good enough for me.
Peace on earth.
Well, what about the Positive Control, the safety catch?  Don't the planes automatically come back unless they get a second order?
I should say practically none, though we have our communications center plowing through every possible three-letter combination. The trouble is that there are about seventeen thousand permutations, and it will take us approximately four and a half days to go through them all.
I want to talk to General Ripper.
Hello, are you still there?...Uh-huh...I'll be right back.  We're still working this thing out.
I don't think so.
War?
Call them every five miles.
Maximum ECM!
Yeah?
Let's see...International Morse, I think ...K...E...O...P...E...R...E...C...A...L... L...M...I...S...T...A...K...E...O...P...E... Gee, I don't know, it seems to be some kind of code.
What's your point, Lothar?
Master Kong.
Recall what mistake?
Take it easy, Major Kong.
Nobody's loyalty is beyond question.  Besides, how do we know one of his staff didn't see it?
Come on, King.  That doesn't make sense.
You're giving them an awful lot of credit for being on the ball.
Maybe the warning system's out.
Have you tried the emergency system?
I'd be mighty proud if you did, Lothar.
Thanks, King.  I've always wanted to take one of these big babies in.
Knock yourself out.
Uh, ninety days. And now I just have to go once a week. See, I'm rehabilitated.
Yeah, but, when I was walking, I realized that he's stuck in that limo all the time. He's stuck with his interviews, he's stuck with his autograph, he has to do whatever his manager tells him to do, you know? He's not free. He's just part of the machine, and if you think about it, freedom's all that there really is.
Yeah, I guess.
You know, like, like, I would always think, uh, you know, what if I make the wrong move? But maybe there isn't any right move. You know? I mean, look at us. You know, we all dress the same, we all talk the same, we all fuck the same, we all watch the same TV. Nobody's really different, even if they think they're different. "Oh, boy, look at my tattoo, you know?" And see, that's what makes me freak. Because I can do anything I want, as long as I don't care about the result.
Was it okay?
Yeah!
What did you guys think?
Typical male.
A cloud.
Oh, untrue, Jeffster. I think, uh, two weeks ago we attended a concert where I had fucked two girls.
And your mom.
I'd get bored.
She was at the Four Seasons last night, man. But you shouldn't worry about that.
No, I know what you're going to say. I don't know anything about making a video. But that's a plus.
But I'd, I'd do it for free. You know, just for my reel.
What?
Look, Tim confessed to me last night.
That's bullshit. That's total utter bullshit.
Mm. You know, does he tell you about how, uh, Jeff, Pony, started the band...?
Sure I am. It's fun.
I can come visit?
Hey, hey, seven-twenty. Seven-twenty.
Um, if you're talking to me, could you make some sense? 'Cause I don't speak Swahili.
Ah, that's nice. They have many convenience stores there for you to stand in front of.
I could.
Yeah!
Come on. Inside.
Well, they, uh they were nice enough to sew it back on.
Deep down. Way down.
It's a mistake to think that.
Hay? Yeah? So teach me a lesson.
He causes problems. He was here earlier.
Actually, the only thing I gotta give that guy is a one-way ticket back to Greaseball-land.
Yeah, of course they let me out. Chickenshits. I gotta pay some class C misdemeanor ticket. So did I call it or did I call it? She spent the night, didn't she? Hm? Oh, that sucks for you, pal. Oh, shit.
You lied to me.
Oh no, no. You know what? Fuck that. No, you lied to me. You lied to me because you're gutless. You're a gutless, drunken looser.
Is that Bee-Bee?
Yeah, well, thank you for the advice, but you wouldn't understand what is going on with me.
That's right.
Okay. Nazeer, okay?
Nazeer what?
Yes.
Your sure as hell right about that.
About things that are important to me.
Like what?
God, KAREN JOHNSON.
One!
Hey!
I'm talking about idealism.
No, no, no. I'm not being cynical, I'm being honest.
Well, if you love him so much, why didn't you go see him play?
It got that close.
How?
I don't know. I would've done something. This is kind of hypothetical, isn't it? This place is so stupid. I can't believe we're sitting here in this mosh-pit of consumerism. With all these people eating their chunks of dead flesh...
And?
My goal is to make art.
Why should I stay here, Jeff? So we can sit on the corner and watch the lights change, while you bitch about Burnfield?
You do.
Is that a threat?
Where are you going?
For a ride.
Wait, away?
What about us? I'm moving away your staying here.
Just go.
Yeah.
Aw, come on. Rock star. Fame. Fortune. Sex.
Oh, uh, yeah, we were, but, uh, Sooze, screwed up the tickets.
So how's college?
No, man, I mean it. You're a good writer. I remember those things you'd write during honors English. Funny shit.
What?
I don't know.
No, this has everything to do with you.
So? What's L.A. like?
No, she was just sitting there?!
I don't want you to do the cover, I, I need you to do the cover.
I'm always serious.
Yeah.
Hey, man, uh, look, if you don't like my stuff, uh, I won't sing it, okay? I'm sorry, you know?
I can't believe you're still here.
Yep.
Me?
Oh, my god!
I think I gotta go.
Nobody's fucking anybody!
Well, I mean, she always answers her beeper.
Yeah? Well, what'd she say?
Oh, come on, Pony. I'm just kidding. Wow, you rock stars are really sensitive, huh? You know, there's a life on the road?
Oh, okay, it's none of my business. Yeah, so, you-you're trying to fuck my best friend's girlfriend and it's none of my business?!
Missed it. Can I get a fifth of Old Crow?
I did. I split, man. I expanded my horizons, you know. Served my country. Saw the world, you know? I've gained wisdom and now I'm back, baby, back from the road. Me and Jack Kerouac.
Oh that's nice for you.
Shut up, Cleo.  Di, how much do you need for an abortion?
Forget it.  I've got a scholarship to Harvard hanging over my head.  I won't risk it.
Conan went to Harvard.
Everything's fine.  I'm just having a little trouble keeping my frown upside down.
Spit from your dad?
Y'think?
Diane, I've loved you ever since I first saw you -- right before you kicked me in the head.
Diane, there's no excuse for not taking your pre-natal vitamins.  Now, if you guys were really friends, you'd remind her to take these.
You sure I'm not fat?
Lucy, do you know for sure you're going to get that scholarship?
Di, it's not your fault.  We all wanted to do this - for you... for ourselves.
Hee-hee-h-wait a minute.  Hold on, now. What do we do before a big game?
He Ikea'd us.
For a pack of cigs?  I use her food stamps.
Oh thank Buddha it's you, Kim-Lo, I'm being held against my will, my civil rights have been violated and it took four days to make this one phone call...
Right.  That'll be fifteen hundred - cash.
I know, Hannah.  Look, I'm not going to get an abortion.  I mean, I always planned to get married and have kids - I'm just going a little out of order. Kinda reminds me of another young lady who found herself "with child," unmarried, on a long road, with no place to sleep.  'Course, that was a long-long time ago.  But no matter what, she held her head high and said... "Pappa don't preach, I'm in trouble deep.  Pappa don't preach, 'cause I'm keepin' my baby.  Hey.  I'm gonna keep my baby." The great one...
Ooops, hold on a sec.
Shit!  Yeah, Grandma.  Me and the squad.
Uh...maybe?
So could half the women in here.  And I'd rather go out with a nice can... So watcha here for?  To say how much you hate me or how much your grandparents hate me...
Now how the hell can I help you?
More proof God's a guy...
I'm terribly sorry, Mr. de Mille.
Of course you didn't.  You didn't know Norma Desmond as a plucky little girl of seventeen, with more courage and wit and heart than ever came together in one youngster.
Where's the bar?
I'll have the bell-hop take care of your luggage.
What's wrong with it?
Schaefer.  Betty Schaefer.  And right now I wish I could crawl into a hole and pull it in after me.
Why, you sweet kid.
Drop that attitude.  Here's some- thing really worth while.
As for instance?
Well....
We could make some paper boats and have a regatta.  Or should we just turn on the shower?
Phillip, you're mad!
I've got twenty pages of notes. I've got a pretty good character for the man.
What about all those ideas you had?
See if they make sense.  To begin with, I think you should throw out all that psychological stuff -- exploring a killer's sick mind.
I'm not good enough to write it alone.  We'll have to do it together.
I think so.  They're on location in Arizona, shooting a Western. I'm free every evening, every week- end.  If you want, we could work at your place.
Something came up.  I don't want to talk about it.
Why not?
This is where you live?
Just look around.  There's a lot of her spread about.  If you don't remember the face, you must have heard the name of Norma Desmond.
You know, crazy things happen in this business.  I hope you haven't lost your sense of humor ...
It is not.  Get out.
Yeah?
Why?
Salome -- what a woman! What a part! The Princess in love with a Holy man.  She dances the Dance of the Seven Veils.  He rejects her, so she demands his head on a golden tray, kissing his cold, dead lips.
I will not have it butchered.
Of course not.  But it ought to be organized.  Just an editing job.  You can find somebody.
There's something wrong with your car, you said.
I'm used to paying my own bills.
You proud boy, why didn't you tell me you were having difficulties.
Cut away from me?
They've come for my car.
I need some money right now.
There are no other guests.  We don't want to share this night with other people.  This is for you and me.
I understand some rich guy bought up all the tickets for a perfor- mance at the Metropolitan and sat there listening to La Traviata, all by himself.  He was afraid of catching cold.
Keep it.
Maybe deMille is shooting.
It couldn't have gone better. It's practically set.  Of course, he has to finish this picture first, but mine will be his next.
I think I'll read a little.
Why do you say that?
I went for a walk.
You don't care.  do you?  But hundreds of thousands of people will carel
What about the studio? What about De Mille?
That's a lie!  They want me, they want me!  I get letters every day!
For me?  Okay.
The doctor suggested it.
I'm not inquiring where Mr. Gillis goes every night...
Why don't you? I'm writing a script and I'm dying to finish it, no matter what.
Now wait a minute.  If we made it a girls' softball team, put in a few numbers.  Might make a cute musical: It Happened in the Bull Pen -- the story of a Woman.
If it was a quarrel, how come you had the gun right there?
Had he been trying to blackmail you?
Yes, Madame.
Softball.
He will be. In about five minutes.
Have fun.
Is it her that's bothering you--or your gardener?
There's no such thing as an accident. Everything has meaning, if you can read the signs.
It's not important. The important thing is I'm here to find something and I think you can he1p me.
You're not afraid are you?
It's paradise . We could be very happy here.
But why?
And now...the guitars are out of tune, and the words don't make sense, and somebody unplugged the mike...
But what if---it wasn't real?
Oh, you know how parties are. Always some damage.
Nurse! Help !
I don't want your help.
You vicious--
Supergirl?
Say---you think that's the same guy who was in the accident with Lucy?
You bet your ass.
As brave as my father. As wise.
Somebody's gotta do something!!
Mr. Danvers called. I'll get a new one with the insurance money. B.F.D.
I have to get back. I'm having dinner with the Danvers.
I'm Linda Lee.
No, MR. Danvers.
You would! You revealed our existence so you could have all of our power.
It's just one more crime you'll have to pay for.
Not yet.
For what?
No, it wouldn't work, you couldn't, it's too--- if it didn't work you'd be swept into a singularity--- no, you'd never make it. Forget I mentioned it.
Then come with me.
Please. I have to get back to Earth. My friends are in trouble. And unless I bring back the Power Source, Argo City will die.
First the supplier couldn't find the invoice. Then the order came up short. Then I missed the four o'clock plane from Cleveland and had to rent a car, and then I got a darn flat tire on the highway! Can you beat it? Boy, your boss must've been furious when I didn't show up by the end of the day today, huh?
Tuesday.
TUESDAY! I got to get it all set up in his office tonight before all those big shots come here tomorrow for the meeting!!
Brad?
Nope.  Never. 
It isn't only that he's small for his age. how would you like to be the only kid in town without a father?  Look at him, he's stewed to the gills in the middle of the afternoon.
Lana, I'm from Metropolis. I see Superman every day.
Look, I don't know, Kent. . . CLARK  Personally, I think it could be a terrific story!
What!
You are, I was about to say, no longer eligible.
Columbia.
Me? How?
They ain't got captains?
Not like this one you ain't. Nobody in the world got one like this 'cause it don't exist yet. We got to build it.
What will it do?
Anything.
Yeah, sure.  Ain't nobody gonna stomp my electric train...
Can't wait, pal, can't wait.
I was afraid you'd say that.  Hey, is there a bus station around here?
Sister! I'm his sister!
We've already met.
Whoopee.
Turn on the light.
Gus?
He can have mine. Anytime.
But how? Where's it getting the power from ???!
53!
You've got to pick three more numbers.
How'm I supposed to turn this thing?
Storms! Floods!
Today coffee----
I could have it all! Holy cats! All the oil! All the tankers! All the pumps! The gosh-darn world will be out to lunch! No heat, no gas--sis, this is some nifty idea!
We can get to work on that oil!
Hostages?
Do I detect a note of jealousy?
Sure! But nobody knows it. Least of all you.  Look, would you mind if I gave you some constructive criticism?
And you weren't. As usual. What do you say to that?
Uh-uh.  Listen, I'll tell you what. You say I'm wrong. And I say I'm right. So why don't we make a little bet on it?
I was right. you are Superman.
Oh come on, that's ridic -
Well, not in your mind, but maybe . . .deep in your heart . . .
Oh, I'm not blaming you.  I just know me. I'd be jealous. Jealous of . . . of all humanity.  Some rival, huh?
Clark, stop feeling so threatened every time you hear his name. Nobody expects you to be what you're not.
Everything on it.
Dickens! The whole world's about to blow up and you're reading Dickens?!
There is some good in you, Lex, after all.
A parka.
A good time! Is that all you care about?!
It' s fantastic! ----- This place is genius.
Isn't that what the old Canaveral guys used to call a comet on an East-West trajectory?
I asked the right question.
Ahhhhhh -- Alpha Waves.
Oh magnificent one. What I am bargaining with is what you do not have -- the son  of Jor-El.
What do you want?
Dinner. Oh yes.  I'm sorry, I just never do much about that.  But tonight -- I mean, anything you want, Lois.
Where is his home, Lex Luthor? Which way?
Yes. To all of us. The closer we come to an atmosphere with only one sun - a yellow sun - the more our molecular density gives us unlimited powers!
And so I was yesterday. And the day before.
"Super-sucker . " For once, Lex Luthor was right.
I really don't think . . .
What about here?
Oh . . . Right. . . I'll be back in a flash.
Let's sit down. They walk to the table. LOIS calls out to the balcony.
Maybe if you'd have met who I am now, instead of the spoiled brat you met a few weeks ago, it would have been different between us.
Clark . . . wait!
Of course it is. Do you know what the sun is? Why it's just one huge nuclear bomb. A bomb with enough radiation to incinerate an average man like . . .  that.
Don't be over-dramatic, young lady. What kind of disaster could we help bring about?
Right . . . you want to tell him how you feel . . .
But why the hair?
Hmm . . . Nuclear levitation. Now that's a trick that could come in handy.
Good. Let's hope he stays that way.
You are . . .
No, no, listen. I escaped with only one thing on my mind . . . the end of Superman.
You'd risk worldwide nuclear war for your own personal financial gains.
You're a great architect, Albert.
Otherwise, you're a Mongoloid idiot.  It's reasonable to assume that fragments of the planet were shot out into space by the force of the explosion, and  --
Lois isn't here?
Anyway, we Kent's don't like showoffs, ain't that so? A body's got to be humble even if he knows that he's better'n his neighbors.
Hey, you're getting a better class of people in your office these days, Boss.
No.
Huh?
Don't you ever give up?
There's no real proof that tobacco  --
Come again?
Mirrors, then. It's done with mirrors.
Look, there was probably a trampoline on the roof somewhere and this joker just took a big bounce.
What are you doing here?
He wants to see you. Lex Luthor.
So I've noticed.
Krypton? The place where Superman comes from?
Bingo!
I know I'm going to get rapped in the mouth for saying this, but so what?
La de da da...
Nothing.
This all has something to do with Superman, doesn't it?
I didn't bring any  --
My friends, I am not a rash, impulsive person. I'm not given to wild, unsupported 	statements. We must evacuate this planet immediately!
Folks'll ask question.
I was thinkin' what to call him. I was thinkin' I had an uncle who was a fine man, you recall him? The Church Sexton
We don't want a child called 'Junior,' ain't that so, Clark? Why sure it is.
Their atmosphere will sustain him. He will look like one of them.
How good it felt!
Not while I'm around you're not. C'mon...
There's been a lot of confusion in the media about who I am and what I'm up to and all that. I'd like to set the record straight. With your help.
Unlisted number, Shall we proceed?
Do you like pink?
Yessir. Just what you wanted.
Not there!  A pine tree in Death Valley? Idiot! This is for the North Woods section!
It wouldn't hurt. You can't go on living in fantasies. Did you really think you could get hold of a nuclear bomb? And drop it?  Why, our Strategic Defense boys would have  --
He used to work with you.  Until you found out he was having an affair with your wife.
Leave us alone, Stephens.  Leave the people of this town alone.  You can't help.
The Walkers have agreed.  The Ottos. Nicole Burnell's parents.  It's important to initiate proceedings right away.  Things get covered up. People lie.  That's why we have to begin our investigation quickly. Before the evidence disappears. That's why I'm out here tonight.
Billy, please.  The children.
Why?  You got money from Dolores' insurance with the school board.  We all did.
Can't you make it later?
Just like we look forward to this.
Something made this happen, Billy. Mr. Stephens is going to find out what it was.
No, nothing like that.  The Ottos are what I'd call model citizens. They're regular at town meetings. They give their opinions  in a respectful way.  They always help out at various fund-raising bazaars in town , though they aren't church goers.
Oh yes.  Like I said, they always came out together to see him off to school.  It's like he was their little treasure.  He was such a beautiful boy.  That's a picture of him on the wall there, behind Abbott.
For rabbits?
From what?
Berries.
You mentioned that he had a learning disability.
Anything you didn't understand?
Summer's over.  It's fall.
What's a ditty again?
It's like a song.
Can I sit beside you on the bus tomorrow?
Because...he wanted to them to be punished.
No.  Not mean.  Just...very angry.
Oh.
Yes.  Like Bear and the Ansel twins and Sean and...
What do you want me to do for you, Mr. Stephens?
Thank you, Nicole.
Will you be spending more than a night?
Crafts.
Why am I calling you?  You're my father.  I'm not supposed to call you?  What's the matter with wanting to talk to you, Daddy?
No.  But this is.  They wouldn't take my blood.
I'm afraid this meat is overdone.
Yes.
What time in the morning was this?
Why were you scared?
Yes.
You don't sound like one hundred percent absolutely sure.
What about insurance?  Doesn't insurance pay for these things?
Well, Mr. Stephens is representing several families.  The Ottos, the Walkers, us, and I think a couple more.  Mr. Stephens is suing the town for negligence.  He's sure that the accident could have been avoided if they had done their jobs right. He's a very smart man.
Nicole, tomorrow Mr. Stephens wants you to make your deposition at the courthouse.  I thought I'd take you over.
Great.
Well, okay.  I'll take you about nine-thirty in the morning.  That's okay with you?
Great.
Is "he" inside?
Looka, Sidney, you're my own sister's son, but where does that give you the right to call me a liar?
Yeah, and it's the truth, to the best of my knowledge.  And, frankly, I'm glad.  For Steve's sake, I'm glad, not yours.  I manage these boys and I got their best interests at heart.  Steve shouldn't get mixed up with no bimbo at his age.
Hurry back.
Just exactly what are you so hot about?  I mean, I know it's a difficult thing to be an artist in this crudest of possible worlds, but --
He's here, isn't he?  Do you think, sir, when he dies he'll go to the dog and cat heaven?
Why?
History repeats itself.  Everything that happened to Alan Leslie...began with a smear like this...
A man couldn't ask for a squarer shake.  Let me have Billy Van Cleve...  Don't ever tell anyone, Susie, how I'm tied to your apron strings...  Billy!  J.J.!  What's this about that boy?  What boy?  Where are we, lug, in a drawing room comedy? You're brain is warming up, sweetheart - yeah, Dallas!...  No, don't explain your point of view, but...
No...
Before you leave, son, I'll answer your question---Susan Hunsecker is the injured party here!  Or will I be hearing next that I don't even have my sister's welfare at heart...
Correct me if I'm wrong - WE! Because when I'm out on this very slippery limb for you, you have to know what's involved.
And who's feet is she on now?
Wild?  Take a look at them and see who's wild...
...And he's got them on him.  I appreciate a thing like that - I appreciate where you are looking out for the virtue of the city.
Hello.
Yeah.  Otis Elwell.  The columnist.
Take a top coat.
Dallas, ask your own manager - he's standing here like a pained wolfhound - Hunsecker and Elwell are enemies to the knife.  So how do you get him doing J.J. a favor?
Don't you think it's about time you shut yours?  Who are you to tell a man like Frank D'Angelo to shut up?!
Well, for one thing, he thinks J.J. is some kind of monster.
Please, Sidney, I can't stand this -
Don't explain, Sidney... It doesn't matter now...
If the stores are open -
I made you write a beautiful song...
Not what you're doing now.  At least don't ask me - don't ask him. You're fighting for your life! What do YOU want to do?
No one must follow your work.
Let me try mine.
I'm a cybernetic organism.  Living tissue over a metal endoskeleton.
I would.
Negative.  She is not a mission priority.
You just can't, okay?  Trust me on this.
Just say "I swear I won't kill anyone."
I sense injuries.  The data could be called pain.
You mean people?  I don't know.  We just cry. You know.  When it hurts.
No.
I need to know how Skynet get built.  Who's responsible?
I couldn't... oh, God.  You... came here... to stop me?
SHOOT!!!!
Oh, God... Kyle.  I need you so much.
Correct.
No.
Why him?
I have detailed files.
Son of a bitch, I knew it!
Yes.
On Furtwängler.
When he met Hitler at his birthday and shook hands with him, was he pleased?
I don't know. But you and I already know that he has saved lives.
I'm very sorry.
and totally irrelevant.
Not so, Counsellor. That secretary of yours, she wasn't just your secretary, she procured women for you, didn't she? As many and as often as you wanted.
My manner? Why don't you go downstairs, get a cup of coffee and calm down? What's the matter, Emmi? What's going on with you? What's wrong?
I have a duty.
And your father was executed.
What's in those files?
Do you know where the Adagio begins?
What is this, Emmi?
I don't know, he wasn't my case. Why did you escape to Switzerland just before the war ended?
You didn't complain about the racial policies, just about the musical standards, is that right?
You were real close to all of them, to Adolf, to Hermann, to Joseph, to Baldur, and now Albert,  So, let's hear the truth, let's come clean. What was your Party number?
I've had enough of this, I'm leaving.
Who?
Gee, that's a thing of beauty, honest to God, a real thing of beauty. I'm going to try to remember that. Liberty, humanity and justice. Beautiful. But you used the word 'naive'. Are you now saying you think you were wrong? That art and politics can't be separated?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Well, I tried, you got to admit I tried. I thought I might just trap you there, Wilhelm, but David here was too quick for me. Smart move, David, smart move. No, I don't have the telegram, but I know it exists. And I want you to know, Wilhelm, we're going to keep looking for it because I believe you sent it.
That's an outrageous lie!
Well. Once he said he'd read what this man wrote about me.
He said, 'Don't mind him. His job is to criticise, your job is to conduct.'
I have no idea.
Well, I'm just beginning to develop my theme. Isn't that what you call it in classical music, developing your theme? Okay, so they played on your insecurity. That's human, understandable. But, there is one guy who doesn't like little K as much as he likes you - yeah, the number one man your old pal, Adolf. He thinks you're the greatest, and when he says, I want Wilhelm for my birthday, boy, they better go out get Wilhelm. So, Josef calls and threatens you with little K. And you said to hell with the Ninth in Vienna, I'll give it to Adolf as a birthday present in Berlin. That's the trick they played, they got you by the balls and they squeezed. Hard. Why did you stay? Why did you play for them? Why were you the flag-carrier for their regime?  Jealousy?
I said I have illegitimate children. I don't know how many.
Speaking to Party members I used their language, of course I did, everyone did.
Of course I know what that is.
It means I wasn't good enough to be a first violinist.
How could I know what's in the archive?
How could I forget?
Furtwängler sent Hitler a telegram for his birthday.
Edwin von der Null. Music critic. He gave Furtwängler terrible reviews while he raved about Herbert von Karajan.
His private life?
Yes, Dr. Furtwängler was absolutely clear about this: politics and art must be kept separate.
Yes.
Like this bandleader.
First oboe.
He also conducted for Hitler, didn't he?
Do you really think it was brave? Didn't he bow to him and shake his hand?
Alright!
All.
Wrong.
No. But you will.  It's very important that you live.
Right.
Forget it?  Are you crazy? Let me see it.
Just talk.  Tell me about my son.  Is he tall?
Come on, me? The mother of the future?  Am I tough? Organized?  I can't even balance my checkbook.  I cry when I see a cat that's been run over... and I don't even like cats.
Look, Reese, I didn't ask for this honor and I don't want it. Any of it.
Okay.  Talk some more.
About what?
Tactically dangerous.  We lay low.
My whole life has been combat.
Probably.  Sarah, if I get zeroed...
Someone?
You're not supposed to.
We did it, Kyle.  We got it.
I see.  And this...computer, thinks it can win by killing the mother of its enemy, kill- ing him, in effect, before he is even conceived?  A sort of retroactive abortion?
Why?
Surrounded by living tissue.
I can't sleep.
Go ahead.  You're safe.  There're thirty cops in this building.
I already did.  No answer at the door and the apartment manager's out.  I'm keeping them there.
Admittedly...
Will you really hold me to it over <u>pennies</u>?
You want to know what it is?  What it's all about?  John.  Chapter nine.  Verse twenty-five.
I said I was sorry...
I want to know what's going on.  Are you part of this?
What <u>is</u> your problem?
"... wait for help."  Wait for help. I'm not opening a door that specifically warns me not to.
You first.
This isn't an attempt to be gallant. If I don't lift you, how are you going to get there?
That one did.
Don't.  It was a shitty job anyway. I overreacted.
Come here...
It was left in my hotel room, well, not really mine.  You're saying it's not you?
I don't...
Get out.
Call them, tell them to get the boss up here.  Tell them I'll kill you...
Where'd you get that gun?
We searched the house.
No, now wait... think about it.  What did you see... ?
Stop talking...
That's not true...
I realize.  Maybe you could... tell me a little about yourself.
They'll be wanting it back.
Trust me.  Call that number.
Why?
Just drive, man.  It's fucking nuts!
How do you mean, exactly?
Everything.  I'm a goddamn human-pinata...
How do you know?
You're going?  Well, thanks again.  Good to see you, Rachel...  Thanks for coming, Mel.  I'll get your car back.  Right now it's, uh... at the zoo.  Sorry.
Happy Birthday, Nicholas.
Oh... it's a game.
Cursory examination.  Turn-your-head- and-cough sort of thing.  You'll be out of here in no time.
How do I find them?  Their offices are empty.
Like, this way... sort of...
Have we met?
Thank you.  Goodnight.
I've finished for the evening.  Will you be needing anything else?
I'm not sure.
I'm just like him.
The Hinchberger wedding.
Is Alan Baer "the Game?"  Is that what this is?
Nothing.  Nothing at all.
Follow me.
What about the house?
You warm my heart.
Uh... Nell Vance...
Well, I... uh...
Who's Watts?
Just stay there, Nell!
We can't stay here looking for her.  She doesn't want to be found...
Not the way you've constructed your group, it's just not ethical!
This is the last chapter.  Please, please give me clearance.  It's for science.
Why?
Then who called me?
No --
Good.
No, but Nell's been here longer than I have.
Good morning, Theo.  Luke.
How could you do this to people?
Oh!  You scared me.
Rene Crain.  Up there.  Rope. Ship's hawser.  Hard to tie. Don't know how she got it.
That's why we're here.
A blank canvas!  I could paint your portrait, directly on you. Or maybe not.  So, you?  Husbands? Boyfriends?  Girlfriends?  Where do you live?
Yes.  I've missed it.
You, too.  Happy tossing and turning.
Maybe he never came in.  If he'd come in, he would have left his bags at the door, right?  Or maybe he got here early, and went for a walk, and fell.  Maybe he's outside.
I don't know, you know...
Nell, it makes sense.  It all makes sense.  You and I, we were scaring each other, working each other up.
Could be worse, he could've named you Reticulum.
It's not a knock.
It's not a compliment.
It's an observation.  Like:  I'm hungry. When are we eating?
I'm not into finger foods.  Too fussy.
Who?
It must've been a time.  A golden moment.
Our black friends?
What did you tell them.
Heavier than that now.  But are there any drugs in that stomach to back up your story.
Let him break - he likes to break.
I wouldn't talk.
I saw your mother on the Strip last night.  She went up to three guys, said she'd like 'em to stick one in each, know what I mean?
Lookin' good.
What'd you call that -- the Protector?
Where abouts?
Valentine wasn't even there.  If he was into something, if she was involved -- who can say.  But I'll tell you something.  She stood in front of these dudes, man.  Eyeballing <u>them</u>.  Checking <u>them</u> out.  I felt like she was covering <u>my</u> ass that day.
Not me, man.  I'm no drug dealer, what you think.
I already told you, man.  Corcoran.  Know what that is?  State prison.
Travelling on a dodgy passport, n' all.
I mean, it's already a steal, n'it -- what you said -- four hundred for this one?
And that's where you met Jenny.
Faith.
He's gotta know why.
Again?
Not her brand.
When you've lost as many years as I have, love, puts things in perspective, know what I mean.
How'd you manage that, then.
In Jenny?  'Course not.  How could I be. 'Course I wasn't.
Yesterday.  Afternoon.
Were you still married at the time -- to Jenny's mother, I mean?
-- Your employer?
Proprietor of a London firm.  Of longstanding.
Based in London, but with international concerns.
Right.
You don't believe it was a car accident.
We were <u>lucky</u> to be nicked.  Me and the lads went down there Sunday evening, we weren't discovered till the Monday.  Good job we were still breathing.
Who remembers.
Just now?  Overnight?
You <u>have</u> been away.  Or is all this just new to you?
Honest.  Didn't know where to look till I was 21.
Only in the movies.
What about your grandmother?
I know that.  But as time went on ... well, it <u>wasn't</u> a joke, was it?  She had a feeling about it -- about the last job -- how long I'd get the hook for.  Said she wouldn't be there this time when I got out.
I can well believe it.  I'm sure he has done, son.  He's about as straight as a dog's hind leg.
Eh?
And that is?
I could swear I met you with Ian at the EMI offices in London.
Sounds like you need a rest.
Makin' trouble for someone?
Good luck.
And I said so what.  You think she's any happier?
Any happier than any other asshole in life.
Lemme break.
I happen to know more about Mr. Whatever- his-name-is than he thinks I know about him and his operation.
Drugs?  Cash?  Both if we're lucky.
How we gonna get that lucky?
While they're all fucking each other over ... couple of parties like us could move right in.
No trouble.
Go to him.  Go to his studio, or writers workshop or artists colony, Esselin retreat, nudist camp --
That's right, your life is Shit, and I'm to blame.  It's that simple.
You must know Ian.
I suppose that's good, unless things were fine the way they were.
The government knows. I cannot repeat it to you. But this thing goes deep, Ed. This was not your wife. I goes deep, and involves the government. There is a great deal of fear. You know how certain circles would find it--the knowledge--a threat. They try to limit it, and--
It's OK, I guess. No, I don't really. I'm not big on music, ordinarily.
I'm so sorry... I was sorry to hear.
Well, sure, I guess. Pop says so too. I work pretty hard at school.
Look, I'm no expert, but--
Ah... it's nothing.
I don't understand.
Well, look, I don't claim to be an expert--
It's called dry cleaning. You heard me right, brother, 'dry cleaning'-- wash without water, no suds, no tumble, no stress on the clothes. It's all done with chemicals, friend, and your garments end up crisp and fresh. And here's the capper: no shrinkage.
And how do we share--
Right! Strictly business.
Yeah, good. Lemme just, uh...
Uh-huh.
Couldn't be better. These're boom times in retailing. We're opening another store, Big Dave's Annex, there on Garson. This is strictly haberdashery--casual wear, pyjamas, ladies' foundations and undergarments. Matter of fact, I'm thinking of making Doris the comptroller. How're things at the, uh, the barbershop?
Uh-huh.
I only work here! And the lady's husband would know... Oh, Jesus.
$10,000! I don't know what to do, Ed. I don't know what I *can* do. Even though I know who the sonofabitch is.
Would he... it sounds pretty obvious.
Well, I guess he don't care that it's obvious.
How's that?
How are you?
I helped him cook the books, Ed. I did do that.
--don't interrupt me--that's Means. They got a fine upstanding pillar of the business community as a victim, and then they got *you*, a disgruntled number-juggling underling who on the day in question was drunk as a skunk and whose alibi for the time in question is being passed out at home, alone.
*I* was with her.
So... who... who actually--
Sure you don't need one?
Yeah, the best.
I don't work here. My wife does.
I know who you are, Mr Crane.
How d'ya like them apples?
Huh?
Yeah, yeah--go home.
Close ranks! Goddamnit! Those sons of bitches!
I don't care what it costs! This is when ya come together!
That's very generous.
Uh-huh.
Crane? We have to tell you, as soon as you're conscious--is he conscious?
Under arrest for murder.
He said OK. Is that what he said?
I've read about the Museum's financial troubles.
Eight to the right!  Look!  I found it!
That's great if you're stopping a burglar.  Not our goal here.  Are there motion detectors?
I told you!  They seal off all the cells.  They were designed to fall automatically in a system failure --
You said the system couldn't fail!
Where the hell are you?
It's a little late, you son of a bitch.  There's a friggin' monster loose in here!  Get the FBI, the fire department.  Find metal cutters, cut through.  And bring a cannon.  The damn thing is huge.
Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI.
Night watchman who found the body. Sweet old man.  Been tossing his cookies for over an hour.  Not a likely suspect.
If you don't mind a suggestion, you might try a saliva test.
This isn't an animal, Vince.  I've been on this case four months, remember?  I've learned a few things.
You've been holding out on me Pendergast.  You have a suspect capable of this?
We haven't got time.  You have to meet with museum security so we can make a decision about tonight.
Go out the north exit!  There's a hallway and a false wall by the Greek vases.  Run!
The virus itself might have positive applications.  They'll keep the plants in secure lock up while the studies are made.  Greg isn't joining us?
Got my hands full here.
I don't know.  I thought Dr. Whittlesley died in South America.
No, Margo.  This is one problem you can't solve.  You have to stay out of it.  The fact is, I want to retire.
My work on fossil intermediates would be crippled without you.
Your work is highly relevant.  What about your display on Primitive Pharmacology?  Cuthbert told me himself he was going to feature it prominently in the Superstition Exhibit.
With the intelligence of a human being, the speed of a greyhound, and the strength of a grizzly bear.
It's one of the fire doors.  Good Lord, Margo.  We're trapped!
Margo, you haven't heard?
I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad tidings, but you know me.  Telegraph. Telephone.  Tell Kawakita.  I got the definitive word from Cuthbert's secretary.  This is Dr. Frock's last week.
Tell me about the last expedition. What was he looking for?
They're all heavily armed.
What was it?
Gone.
How?
It's deceptively simple.  Like a Bruckner Symphony or a Matisse.
Thank you.
--a dead one at that.
How <i>do</i> you intend to explain his twenty- two year absence?
Of course.
It has to be the reality.
We find many viewers leave him on all night for comfort.  Haven't you ever watched your child or your lover sleep?
I'm the creator.
--You never had a camera in my head.
Why not?
Lauren, right?
No?  Really?  Good, I mean, I thought possibly a pizza.  How about Friday?
I...I can't.
Sure.  It's halogen.  Shame it didn't hit you - you could've sued.  You coming for a drink?
Are you okay?  You look like shit.
Really?
What's that?
Your mother called.  You shouldn't upset her like that.
You're upset because you want to go to Fiji.  Is that it?
I've changed my mind again.  What's New Orleans like this time of year?  Mardi Gras.  Or let's just see where the road takes us.
Let me out, Truman.  You're not right in the head.  You want to destroy yourself, you do it on your own!
No.  You said, "Do something."  Who were you talking to?  Tell me!
Oh, just so.
--Darling--
Who?
Just listen.  You remember when you were a little boy, you stood up in class and said you wanted to be an explorer like Magellan--
You can count on it.
Yeah.
Well, we're FBI agents.
You're not FBI agents.
Yup.
What do I do.  I'm a key figure in an ongoing government charade. An annoyance to my superiors. A joke among my peers. "Spooky," they call me. Spooky Mulder. Whose sister was abducted by aliens when he was a kid. Who now chases little green men with a badge and a gun, shouting to the heavens and anyone who'll listen that the fix is in. That our government's hip to the truth and a part of the conspiracy. That the sky is falling and when it hits it's gonna be the shitstorm of all time.
Why don't you go home to the old lady --
When was that?
-- those are very serious allegations, Agent Scully --
Well...where would you like me to start? Antarctica is a long way from Dallas, Agent Scully. I can't very well submit a report to the Attorney General that alleges the links you've made here. Bees and corn crops do not quite fall under the rubric of domestic terrorism.
Most of what I find in here is lacking a coherent picture of an organization with an attributable motive. I realize you're very lucky to be alive Agent Scully. The ordeal you've endured has clearly affected you -- though the holes in your account leave this panel with little choice but to delete these references from our final report to the Justice Department. Until which time hard evidence becomes available that would give us cause to pursue such an investigation.
No. No...we need to try our vaccine on it.
We have a situation. The members are assembling.
The Federal Building was too well guarded.
Michaud was a patriot. The men he's loyal to know their way around Dallas. They blew that building to hide something. Maybe something even they couldn't predict.
Dr. Kurtzweil, I'm not interested in bigoted ideas about race or genocide. I don't believe in the Elders of Zion, the Knights Templar, the Bilderburg Group or in a oneworld Jew run government --
According to the newspaper, FEMA had been called out to manage an outbreak of the Hanta virus. Are you familiar with the Hanta virus, Agent Mulder?
And are you familiar with FEMA? What the Federal Emergency Management Agency's real power is? FEMA allows the White House to suspend constitutional government upon declaration of a national emergency. To create a non-elected government. Think about that.  What is an agency with such broad sweeping power doing managing a small viral outbreak in suburban Texas?
What killed those men?
What killed them I won't even write about. I tell you, they'd do more than just harass me. They have the future to protect.
I'll know soon enough.
Your guess?
Scully, I found the bomb.
All I told them was the truth.
They have divided us, Mulder. They're splitting us up.
This isn't about you, Scully. They're doing this to me.
No.
And you're looking for?
You're telling me the cause of death on the report is false. That this man didn't die from an explosion, or from flying debris.
What did you find?
That I don't know. But if it's through simple contact of blood to blood, and if it doesn't respond to conventional treatments, it could be a serious health threat.
I don't know, Mulder.
This is great. This is fitting.
Yeah, well they may this one.
I hear the humming. Like electricity. High voltage maybe.
Come on!
I need you on this, Scully --
Hang on. I'm going to get you out of here.
Yes you can. You're going to make it, Scully.
She was with me.
-- if it looks bad, it's bad for the FBI --
She's in there right now saying the same thing about you.
How deep does this go?
I'm sorry. My grandson fell and broke his leg.
Let me remind you who is the new race. And who is the old.  What could be gained by withholding anything from them; By pretending to ignorance? Our knowledge may forestall their plans to step up the timetable. To start Colonization early.
No, you need only take away what is most precious to him.
I don't want to find out.
Shush.
And he might blame you for terrifying him.  That one moment could erase all you've accomplished.  And if that happened, the trust he has in you is gone.
I don't want you up all night reading Edward's case file of the nine millionth time.  Balance, dear girl, is the key. Leave the work here.
I've got to feed my cat.  Besides, I want to get to bed early.
That's my girl.
A pocketful of fucking rye.  What's wrong?
Really?  I don't work with violent cases, I work with children.  But even a kid lies.  They love it when they get you to believe something that isn't true.  Don't you think Stargher would do the same?
You don't know the procedure.
He might tell me about Julia.  The part of him that wants to help, that feels shame and remorse.  Who wants to be redeemed.
This is Stargher we're talking about?
Evil.
He brought you to me, didn't he?  If you want Julia to live, trust me.  Trust him.
Give her a minute.  Hello, Valentine.
You're kidding me.
Pump in two liters of pure oxygen, please Henry.
Any psychiatric medication?
I doubt that.
You're looking well.
What about the cat?
Grandparents.  Live over in Davis.
Now?
Now.
Damn, man, I give up.  Your partner tells you his wife's gonna have a baby, and all you care about is a coroner's report!
Sit down.
Yes.
Were you at the inquest?
They're forged.
Silly looking bunch.
Oh, it's very difficult. You know Harry...we didn't do...
Why?
Seventy pounds a tube. He wanted me to write for his great medical charity.
I'm sorry.
I shall be all right.
Oh, well.
Why are you lying?
From Kurtz. They have just been arrested. But Harry won't come, he's not a fool.
I helped Harry fix her papers, Mr. Martins...
Entschuldigen sie. It was a terrible thing.
And my passport?
I don't know.
They are - private - letters.
I don't...
Fellow called Lime.
No, sorry.
No.
What are you trying to say?
He was...
Ever seen one?
Going to find me the real criminal? It sounds like one of your stories.
Getting around, Martins.
I'm not interested in whether a racketeer like Lime was killed by his friends or by accident. The only important thing is that he's dead.
This is where he vanished.
We'll never get him in the Russian zone.
Calloway, you expect too much. I know he deserves to hang, you proved your stuff. But twenty years is a long time - don't ask me to tie the rope.
She's right. It's none of my business.
I never knew there were snake charmers in Texas...
I said you win.
Well, there's not much time.
One can't just leave - please.
This way, miss.
Oh, Mr. Martins...
I'll look it up for you.
No, a major, were you really?
On the modern novel - you remember what we arranged and we want you to talk on the Crisis of Faith.
Who?
And - Anna...
Here?
A Roumanian.
Will you give me...
I live in the Russian sector, but you'll find me at the Casanova Club every night. One has to work...
What's the name of this girl?
Yes. The man who helped carry him.
How do you do.
Who?
Er, alive? He couldn't have been alive, not with his head in the way it was.
Yes.
Well make it your business.
Yeah; just ten or fifteen dollars maybe.
Just take it, OK.
Thanks.
I have no idea but it looks like a long way.
Eh - bonsoir.
Sshh. Etienne will be angry if I wake him. He thinks I waste film taking photographs of the sky.
Uh-huh.
Whereas Avi's a Zionist Nazi.
Then I won't bring you....
Why'd we have to leave so fast?
Billings, if Hitler didn't kill six million, why is he your hero?... Concentration camps all over Europe, and he only gets rid of a measly two hundred thousand.... He's a putz.
I don't, but...
Maybe I am. Maybe we're all Jews now. What's the difference?
The point is, the modern world is a Jewish disease.
You want it to be an event.
"And the words fell apart in my mouth like moldering mushrooms..."
Is he a Nazi?
I'm talking to you right now. Who's Linda?
That was a later invention, it's not in the scrolls.... Anyway, the Jews know where the sentences end. They know the whole thing by heart. Every word. Every letter.
No.
Va-yomer adonai el Avram: lech lecha mayartzcha oo-mimohlad-tcha oo-m'bayt avaycha el ha-ertez asher arecha...
Why not?
What assholes.
About doing things. You light candles, say prayers, keep the Sabbath, visit the sick....
You shouldn't.
And be crushed.
Yeah, I remember.... Kill any Jews yet?
I doubt it. How did you find out?
Obviously.
No, but deep down, beneath the "tolerance" they learn on television, nothing's changed. The very word makes their skin crawl.  It isn't even hate, really. It's more the way we feel when a rat runs across the floor. We want to step on it. Crush it. We don't even know why. It's a physical reaction. Everyone feels it.
That doesn't seem to be happening, does it?
No... Yeah, fine, go ahead... So what's this about? Is this about me?
A poison...?
Sexuality??? What do you mean?
You believe that? And you call yourself a reporter?
To discredit me. Because I know who they are. Look, I thought I explained it to you. Those people can say or do anything. And they will. It's all narrative to them, it's... Are you going to print what this guy said?
Yes. Infinitely more. They would become as God.
What were you, following me?
How do you reconcile the two?
Yeah, and what are you? A <i>Times</i> man? A Presbyterian? Impotent? A prick?
That doesn't mean I don't like hearing it.
With the shoes... There was more than one?
I can't say that.
The Bible only says don't seethe a kid in its mother's milk. But chickens don't give milk.
Steve...
Steve's going to explain it.
What kids?...
Nobody ever beat me up.  Look, Linda, there're fifty reasons. Even if you knew them all, there'd be another fifty you didn't know.
No, it's...yeah, it's true, but... how'd you get this number?... No, not here... Maybe Sunday? There's a place off Queens Blvd. Near the courthouse...
I'm not hungry.... Come on, let's drive around.... We don't want to be spotted here.
No, no... Not that kind of... underground. More a private... business. Private.
You want to kill a Jew. I already did.
I can tell....
Just get him in the cross-hairs. With those shells, anywhere you hit him, it'll bounce around, rip his insides all up.
And let us say...
I think anti-semitism today is largely a Jewish phenomenon. Wouldn't you agree?
... Maybe, if Jacques will let me fix up the place a little.
Probably not, but I still don't have the nerve to tell him.
Well, you're going to have to tell him, sometime!
Yes...  Could you please give this to Enzo.
Sorry.  Of course not, definitely not... well, maybe a little.  What did you say?
I'll send Cardoza, he'll be able to...
The Italian, I presume?
Yes, isn't it wonderful?  I'm so happy.  I'll bet I'm the happiest pregnant fired person in the world!
Have you known him long?
Listen to her!  "That's what he's here for"!  He's here to loose, that's what he's here for.  First of all, I'm unbeatable.  Second, how old are you?
Don't you agree, Jacques?
Enzo!
The company asked me to extract everything I could from the wreck; so the divers were trying to get at the engine... and then the boat turned over... in the current... and... look, I fucked up!  Can you help?
You're going to hold me up at a time like this?
He's training.
You shouldn't even carry cigarettes on board!
For others, yes... For you, who knows?
That's too easy!  Every time I beat a record there's always some dumbshit asking me:  "D'you know that French guy, Mayol?  He's supposed to be very good!  Too bad he doesn't compete." So, you're going to come with me to Taormina! First, because you're my friend and second, because you don't have one reason to keep on spoiling my pleasure.  ... I'll see you there...
Not at all!
Ahi, ahi, cazzo!  Ma mamia! Where...?  God, she'll kill me...  ... if she catches me eating pasta in a restaurant.
Then, it's very chic.  Avanti!
... I'm listening.
So what!?  His job is to hand out the paychecks.  And he does that very well, let me tell you.
I give you this.  You're stubborn... Dumb, but stubborn.
It's never the sea!  It's Roberto, Mamma, that stupid actress... Oh shit!  Jacques, what do you know?
No!  I would never cheat you.
... I was right about what?
Does anybody live to make a second?
I was doing an insurance investigation in Palermo.  I work for an insurance company.  So, I decided to take a few days off.  I don't know this island at all. It really is gorgeous.
... Especially the sneakers.
Because one shouldn't fall in love with creatures from the sea.
... Not at all.
Uncle Louis.  He's a 75 year old amazing guy, isn't he?
You'll try again tomorrow?
What?
Liar!  Thief!  Torturer!  When you were an orphan I nursed you at my breast.
They got the new T.V.
In the spring when he melts!
His mother's an American.  He spent half of his life in the states. I'd try English if I were you.
You've made me a happy insurance person.
Take Esther with you, you'll need the backup.
I said, yeah, about once a week!
Oh. Okay.
I can see. And you also brought a nice girl to come eat by us.
Mom, stop with this already. Of course I love you. You're my mother.
Mom, why don't you put that cat out of its misery?
What a good poop you made in your diaper Mazel Tov! That's right! Mommy loves you! Such a good boy you are!
She said to remind you that you're having Shabat dinner by her tomorrow and also to remind you to bring the Manischewitz.
I'm back on the job for the JDL. You hear about that crazy white boy who took over as Santa?
It's cool. It's cool. Aveenooh Shalom Alechem, brother.
A stereo type alarm system?
While I was in Taiwan negotiating the solution to our labor problems, I came across a factory that illegally manufactures the most addictive, Jewish pride weakening substance on the planet. I bought the entire plant.
Worse.
It was good. Very chilling, but you still got all the points across that we talked about.
It's Friday.
Why not -- if you like it —- if that's what you really want.
I'd like one of them to say it to you, Charlie. I'd like to have you hear his side of it his reasons. Want to hear them?
Look, Charlie, you didn't do it, and you know you didn't.
Where? Where did you find it?
Who?
Go on -—
Rosita —— I have wondered -—
Well, now that you've had your history lesson, I think I'll get on to the museum.
That's what I don't understand -- why should it come here -- and why didn't it stay here? It's got trees and bushes here -- outside nothing but cement and asphalt.
Caged animals are unpredictable. They're like frustrated human beings. I can't answer your question.
More or less.
To the eye? Like other men.
Couldn't you tell a man like that when you saw him?
No.
Consuelo screamed too -- and Clo Clo. Why did you do it? Why? Quick. Tell me why?
It's better you don't know.
Well, I'm hardly Mrs. Leslie Carter —whoever she was. In fact, I'm not even much of a success around here particularly after the backfire on Jerry's little publicity stunt with the leopard.
Yes, there is something wrong. People who want publicity and don't mind how they get it --what risks they make other people run - - what agony and sorrow they bring to other people --
Nothing much -- just that it might not be a cat this time.
Ask Kiki. Ask any woman. Girls don't put on lipstick in the middle of the night on a dark, lonely street unless they're with a man or expecting a man.
I'm sure of it!
Yes. And I am taking it to headquarters for examination.
That's easy. Me.
No. I thought that might be just a little corny. I want you to lead him in on a leash.
And I never will- you know what's between us — we're a thing But this is serious competition.
The red dress?  No. My black one. Then I'll be just like him.
Jerry, I want you to be soft. You are soft -- inside -— where it matters. I wanted it that day too, but didn't dare tell you.
Nobody? Huh!... How come?
Will you please come with me?
That might depend on where you’re going.
I am Lawrence, sir. Mr and Mrs De Moraes’ majordomo. They are expecting you.
Can it be that you want your brother found?
It’s a snuff movie. Prime paedophile material. I’m told it retails at around £4,000.  I see you don’t require a definition.
The question now is whether or not your brother still owns anything, Mrs De Moraes.
Last night you upset my sleep. Tonight my social life. We have two minutes. My dinner guests are waiting.
Just a moment...  Go ahead.
Uh... Wait a moment, Mrs De Moraes...
Why don’t you ask when I left the Mondrian?
I’ve had a long and unpleasant day. I’m tired and I’m angry. But mad? Not yet.  I paid Leon’s boy a visit this morning. Found him alive and well. Why haven’t you told your husband where he is since reading my note, eh?
I didn’t know my husband and Friedman knew each other. I just...  Do you think we spoke about it? I’ve known for five years. He’s known I’ve known for five years... But not once have we spoken about it. There are things one just doesn’t speak about...
Why do I feel I needn’t answer that?
What happened? Adonis slapped you about a little and you reverted to cowardice?
Where is that?
Simplify and damn.
My husband didn’t need to slap me about, Mr Lombard. I volunteered...
Get to the point, will you...
On... Once...  Once... What are we... you going to do?
You wouldn’t understand.
The dead can wait.
Penrhyndeudraeth, North Wales.
A coffee and a couple of croissants.
The Mondrian, room 504. I was checked out in my absence.
By your Austrian?
Hah... What about Nathalie?
That-that won’t do. That’s not the way it goes. You saw it, you tell it, that’s the way...
She’ll be alright. She’s tough...
What sort have you got?
How much of a hurry are you in?
...On holiday?
Who?  Martin... He’s Martin...
Absolutely, sir. As a matter of fact he called this morning, sir.
Got it. Puppies.
No... I told you on the phone. Whoever broke in messed-up all your papers. I put everything back where I thought it ought to be.  Maybe it’s there with...
Yes. How did...
Spitz. We spoke on the telephone.  My husband...  My daughter, Deborah, whose house this is.  My son-in-law, Carlos...  The gentleman is a business partner of his. 
How did you do that, Mrs Spitz?
No. And before you ask, no, he’s not gay! He has had girlfriends, but nothing serious...
Six weeks ago. He bought a boy of yours.
This one came back and was never seen again. I understand Friedman looked after him.
Maybe the thought of people like you going on holiday bothers me. Come on, let’s go...
Only feeding the disease, eh, Martin?
I told you... The rabble, it’s me...  Huh... It’s sad.
Dying without ever reaching the top...
Hyatt... Friedman’s... at the Hyatt...
Three o’clock.
We need a double-room and as I understand you’re here alone we’d be much obliged if you’d agree to move to a single room...
Have you?
An Austrian.
No! What do you want here? How do you know me?
Yeah... But he didn’t beat the demons...  A quarter of all the shoes sold in Europe are made by or retailed through his parent’s leather empire. All started from a small shop in the East End of London and war reparation money for holocaust victims.
I’m afraid I don’t understand.
He’d come prepared. He had something besides Shiva... ‘Sleeping Beauty’. The Disney film...  Well, it looked like the Disney film. It was something else. I couldn’t watch...
The nineteenth... How come you didn’t know?
Good. You needn’t worry about the Austrian anymore. He’s dead. I’ll be in touch.
Los Angeles is 100 miles away.
Huh... I suppose the idea of a one day trip to Los Angeles doesn’t appeal to you...
Oh. That’d be Rhian, a Welsh chick he used to lay at weekends. She got wise and dumped him months ago...
Let me give you a tip, asshole - no one pulls stunts like what you pulled in London and here tonight and hopes to get away with it. It upsets people. It’s wrong. Fucking wrong.
So why didn’t he?
I think you’d rather not know what I think.
Some guy called to let him know the Frenchman who’d called the night before he left London was in L.A. looking to kill him. He did his sums and decided to take the call seriously.
Mossad?
I don’t know. Could be the sound of jewellery hitting a parquet floor, huh?
Very generous of you all.  How much?
Tremoille... don't.  Please...
Yes, I am.  I'm an archer who can read and write.  Who do you want to write to?
There's nothing to hear -- I haven't done anything.  And why haven't I done anything?  Because none of you will listen to me!!
It's been weeks since they spoke to me.  Since the coronation... no signs... nothing...
Maybe their silence is a sign...? Maybe it's a sign to go home?
But I hear so many voices... one voice saying one thing, another voice saying the opposite -- love your enemy, kill your enemy -- what is good, what is evil...?
Did your voices tell you that?  You told me you hadn't heard them for months...
No, but...
You don't know what you're saying. You're going to leave this place, Jeanne -- you're going home -- or whatever you want -- you're going to be happy, and have children, and...
No... I said "Surrender in the name of the King of France"...
I leave the answer to God.
Why?
Well... at the coronation of King Charles VI...
But if this trial seems fixed, I fear you'll have the very opposite result to the one you want...
So long as this bitch remains alive, our armies refuse to fight!  Don't you understand?  They want proof that God is on their side... and the only way they're going to believe that is when they see her being burnt as a witch!
I will hear you... but not now, not here.
Who are you?
Your trial, Jeanne.  On a charge of heresy.
My name is Jeanne.  My little cross I had round my neck was taken away from me.  I would like to have it back.
As often as you like -- now, please -- for the love of God -- sign!!
He's feeling wonderful.
You think?
So how would you put it?
Supposing she's an assassin?
Tremoille, I'm not even king yet... who'd want to assassinate me?
My dear loyal Tremoille, I know I can count on you...
Let them come!  Let them see who's the true king of France!
Noooo!
But if the devil were to take on the physical appearance of a saint or an angel... or a man... how would you recognize him?  By what he said?
That's enough!  You will answer the question... or face the consequences!
It is all his majesty can afford. He has even donated his very own personal savings.  His majesty will greatly appreciate a gesture of good will in this delicate negotiation between our two families.
Because if they don't, I'll raise such a war-cry against them that they will remember us forever!
Can we -- uh -- discuss this later?
We need another ten minutes...
Calm yourself, Xaintrailles.  Now slowly.  Who has finally done what?
The Dauphin -- he's sending us food -- and supplies -- and an army -- led by Jeanne -- the maiden from Lorraine -- isn't it wonderful?!
Yes.  We can pray.
Good idea...
I don't think.  I leave that to God. I'm nothing in all this, I'm just the messenger.
Maybe... I don't know... but first we have to confess...
Of course I do?  Bring them up!
Why not?  He has good teeth...
Won?!  Such a small word will never do!  This is victory, Jeanne, this is... glory!
Who gave you that horse?
I... don't know... what do you want from me?
They're going to come and visit you in here?
God asked you to do something?
True -- every event has an infinite number of causes -- but why pick one rather than another?  There are many ways a sword might find itself in a field...
No, I do not think so.  I don't think that killing each other will ever bring peace.
Why are you doing this to me??  Do you get pleasure from hurting me?
Ah, pleasure... that's a difficult word to define.  When does the pain end and the pleasure begin...? When did your pleasure begin with that sword in your hand...?
What are you doing on the wall?
I'm trying to make my cross look more beautiful...
No...
Yes, my lord.
My father's.
Then... why are you here so often?
Who is this "he"?
I realize your anger, Jeanne, but we must learn to forgive.  It's hard, but revenge will never bring about peace.
Soon you'll be able to take the Holy Mass, and as you eat of his flesh and drink of his blood, you will be at one with him.
It's like this... I...we...all of them.
Don't forget, Mr. Wladek, they hang them for helping Jews.
Oh, yes. I remember.
Wladek, please.
Come in! come in!
That's your decision.  But when they storm the flat, throw yourself out of die window - don't let them get you alive. I have poison on me, they won't get me alive either!
What?
Can you help us?
I've no money.
It certainly was.
Just one. Dostoevsky. The Idiot. Three zlotys.
That's better than yesterday.
They were taking you away.
So, what's the news?
But I want to help, I want to.
There are always notices going up.
...not even music, nothing, no radios for the Poles. But I'm sure you'll find work, Wladek, a pianist like you.
Pig!
You made contact?
God forbid!
Where do you live?
Yes, like a cave.
Like it were a piano?
Well, yes, in Austria where be conducted the Royal Orchestra.
The Alps.
No, no bible readers.
Well Baines the music lover, I never would have known. Hidden talents George.
They are washed.
What happened?
She says, throw it overboard. She doesn't want it. She says it's spoiled
Hello.
You've missed this bit.
Tomorrow.
That's right.
Joliet badge, Snyder.  Don't cut much up here.
They didn't think he'd be so cagey, that's all.  They'll get him next time.
The bastard.  He can blow his nose all the way.
If you saved a little, you wouldn't have to grift so much.
I'm busy, Floyd.
All right, mark Mottola up a little and put him on a bus.  Nothin' fancy, just enough to keep him from coming back.  Get some local people to take care of the other two.  We gotta discourage this kinda thing.
Hackers.
What am I supposed to do?  Call him for cheating better than me?
All he's gotta do is read.
Yeh, Luther said you could teach me something.  I already know how to drink.
You mean you blew it.
Why?
You gotta keep Lonnegan's con, even after you spent his money.  And no matter how much you take from his, he'll get more.
Well we got some workin' money anyway.
He threatened to kill me.
All we need is a couple days, Henry. A couple days and we'll get Lonnegan down and stomp on 'em.
Get a couple extra guys in the line, then.  We'll give him the shut-out.
He wants to put a half million on Syphon.
We'll give him the hook on the train, and play him here.  You think I can get in that poker game, Eddie?
Yeh, I think so.  I gave the kay- ducer a C-note.  You find out the deck?
Nice work, J.J.
See and raise five.
Don't have much choice, do ya?
You scored blood money today, Hooker.  You need a friend.
No.  They're just the only ones we know of.
Three grand on the black, Jimmy.
He cheats.
He hired a dame to take it from ya.
I could have you put under this train for this, errand boy.
Sometime after 1:00 a guy's gonna call here and give you the name of a horse.  All you do is take this two grand across the street to Shaw's place and bet it on that pony.  There's nothin' to it, but don't take too much time.  We only have 3 or 4 minutes after you get the call.
I'm in.
What is this?  That's my money. You tryin' to muscle me?
He's right, Les.
I didn't get the bet down in time.
Like hell.  You won't even get a review till you're seventy.  And if the board starts to go soft, we'll let ya out in the yard some night with a hard-nose young bull who'll put fifty slugs in your face and ask what you were doin' there later.
Hell yes.  We don't care about the mark.  He deserves what he gets.
I need more proof, that's all. Anybody can get lucky once.
On a 6-1 shot?  The hell with ya. We'll keep the deal we got.
I don't know.  He took it hard.
Sure.  Every bunco man in the country knows Gondorff.
Wouldn't that be too bad.  You'd hafta move outa this nice office ya got.
No.
Sexogerarian, eh?  Yes.  Yes.  But I can't put that in the paper.
Why not?
Nothing.
Darling, you can't go through any more of this.  Now you get together your clothes and your skates and we'll go out to my family's in the country.
You don't understand.  You don't know what's going to happen.
That's gone long ago.  I've got to see him.  Where is he?
Now do you believe me!
And I'll give then proof!
You don't remember me.....  I'm Dorothy Wynant.
How did you ever remember me?
Why don't you try him again?
No.  The lawyer -- I'm going to see him.
I've got to see you alone!
Yes.
Which way did she fall?
That's the truth.
Hello, Nick!  And a party - celebrating father's third murder - 
Take a good look at him, Dad.  Now please try to remember him... 'cause he's going to be your son- in-law.
Dad, this is what I really wanted to ask you....
That's one thing I won't forget.  Where's Macaulay?  I ought to be starting.
Goodbye, darling.  Don't you dare forget...  December 30th.
So you say -  Go on, Bob.
I'll have to try to remember.
You mean about that gun?
Man to man, I'm not.
I haven't got that far yet.  But I don't think that everything points to Wynant.  What about the alibis?
This is enough for me.
He telephoned me today.
Did you go?
I didn't know they had a fight.
Just what I said I'd do.
I thought you said you weren't going there.
So I see.
He's not anybody.  Just a fellow I used to know.
Oh yes.  Why, you told me to sell them a long time ago.
They'll be pretty rough with you....with your record.
Yes?
I haven't been a detective for four years.
You know as much about it as I do. I haven't seen him in three months.
He sends word through Julia Wolf when he wants money...  I give it to her and she gives it to him.
I hate to bother you when you're laid up.
Slim.
Oh, I know he didn't, but I wish I could find him...  I have something very important to tell him. Macaulay won't help at all.  He thinks I just want money.
Macaulay, you drew up Wynant's will.  Mimi was cut off, wasn't she, if she re-married?
Once I wanted five grand --  Cash -
I haven't the time.  I'm much too busy seeing that you don't lose any of the money I married you for.
Maybe a drink would help you.
Maybe it would if I took it.
At breakfast.
Well, quick -- get into bed.  Are you all right?
He'll be here.  Give him time to get his trousers on.  Where's Asta?  Asta!  Asta!
On it!  I'm in it ... They think I did it!
You did.
Philadelphia.  Then he didn't do it, did he, Nick?
All right, hard guy.  Get up and bleed on the rugs.
Catch me letting you go alone!
What are you going to do?
Why shouldn't be close it? He went away.
Goodbye, darling.
Nick!
Why not?
Now Nick, what's that got to do with it?
Mimi...
Well, that's a hot one.  You a bookkeeper!  When were you ever a bookkeeper?
I wouldn't know.  That time he caught me was a accident.  I led with my right.
I know I left them there.
It's a fortune box.
Damn, this is sweet.  We are going to be home in no time.
Better grab up some sand to take home to your family.
He's not so--
He's an idiot, and he's not nearly as hard as he thinks.
You just go when I say go.
What do you figure it to be?
How's he going to want the gold?  He couldn't even know we had it.
That's what he says.  He could be a spy, or something.
No.
What about Jaeger?
Sure, and I guess it was just convenient there was one less person to split the gold with.
So you can give us away?
Why you in such a hurry to get to shooting?
I'd like to go home alive with a couple of Iraqi scalps hanging from my belt.
Wait.  Wait.
We go, we get rich, we go home.  It's that easy.
Oh, that's fun.
You know, you sound just like a boy who's never--
We've got to do something.  We've got to turn around.
I'm just thinking, you know, if the rest of the boys knew what we're doing.  I mean if they knew what we were coming back with.
Don't drink up all of yours, 'cause you aren't getting any of ours.
We're going to get off, all right.  We'll get you off of there.  Just...be cool.
Me and Wes each going take an end of the rope, run our asses of, and yank you off the mine.
Don't let me die, Epps.  I don't want to die.
It stays as it is.  We're halfway home now.  Let's not blow it by people getting ideas.
It should, or it will?  Least going back the way we came we know what we're up against.
We'll find our way.
They'll search the pack.
I'm not like Wes.  Wes was crazy.
What?  Yeah.
I don't want to die.
I know what I did just now was crazy, but you got to understand how much I want that gold.
It's all right.  I don't like it, but it's over now.
We've got to keep moving while there's still light.
Don't you touch it.
The deal was no one touches it until we get out of here.
Place all alone like that?  Must be a boarder check point.
Which boarder?  Saudi?  Kuwait?  Syria?
Probably.
Well, you're going to start with a bang, 'cause you've got four of them to take down.
I don't know.  He didn't have a uniform on.  He...he had on white robes, like the guys who killed Wes.
It wasn't the gold.  It was the claymore mine.  The gold's in my pack.
It's always been like that.  When you left me down in the crevice to send the gold up I figured I'd better...take precautions.  I rigged it to blow if anyone opened the pack.  Just in case somebody thought they could do better on their own.
Still am.  There's more gold than I thought, and since there's only two of us now...  Where should I go?
What?
I'm looking for a favor.  I need a map of Iraqi.
Ready for what?  Sight-seeing?
I don't think we'll go to war.  We shouldn't even be here.  This isn't our fight, it's a regional conflict.  It should be decided regionally.
Oh yeah.  Accidently.
I'm just trying to help you guys out.  It doesn't hurt to know something about Saudi Arabia.
We just about got killed.  You know what happened?  We just about got killed, and you want to go on?
...I figured...I figured you'd turn back.
You have to go with us, Wes.
Doesn't matter.  We're not going to be able to get him off it anyway.
That don't mean nothing.  Iraqis could have just spread them out like that; make us think we're in the clear.
I've got a new agenda now, it's get rich. The only way the Iraqis figure into that is not at all.
You want to say some words?
Vocasity
A shift change should come through the scheduling office.
I didn't.  You asked me about the card.  You're going to get us into trouble.
Don't be so sure.
Look,dirt!
You're not cleared for this precinct.  Let's cross over first.
We could leave, and live in the superstructure....
They're watching us now.
No one can see us now we're alone.
I'm not afraid...I'm not afraid.
It's wrong; so wrong, what we've done....
It seems I am destined to endure many frustrations....but at the same time I am secure in the knowledge that the thrust of my studies has been in the right direction, and that even if it remains incomplete, my search has not been in vain.
But you can't.  We must escape.
You know I have a way with the computers.  I can clear myself for any area.....almost.
Get out of here, Leave me alone.
Right now.
Look!
No, I...
Who?  Me?...I don't know.
Soon he'll be a plastic cube.
...rooms with her.  Our relationship is normal, conforming.  We share nothing but space.  What is she doing to...
Just do it.
You the Bomb Squad?
Now wait just a fucking-
An abandoned machine shop... nice place to build devices. Low rent, too. But, you and Rice ruined their perfect hideout.
Sounds like terrorist heaven.
You don't have to talk about it.
I guess I didn't realize how much I needed him. He kept me straight. It's been tough every second since.
Congratulations, you just built your first ticker.
That's the blasting cap - good! Okay, now grab it by the base and pull it straight up. No, Wait...
People are dying.
A ticking bomb...
Lab's backed up, we're still waiting for it.
I don't know...
Hell, I got a gold watch... it just don't work. Maybe they'll give me a new fishing pole, or something useful.
Someone who smokes French cigarettes.
Reilly, what the hell happened out there? Why didn't you call for back-up?
Report on the case so far.
Fire me later. Close in and we got the bastard.
Yes.
Yes, M'sieu Laval!
You see--  No, no! And <u>yet</u>--  <u>Did</u> I--did--now <u>where</u> could we have--
No ...  Have <u>you</u> ever been in Vienna?
<u>All</u> <u>kinds</u>.
You're looking fine, Major.
You know, I'm not the marrying type. I like to take my fun and leave it.
Oh, yes ... Well, that's not so easy.  Beginnings are always difficult.
Yes, Baron.
Yes, Baron.
But please, Baron. We're not supposed to breathe a word of it. You won't tell anybody I told you?
You can trust me.
And I was only asking you if you would let me examine your report without interruption.
I don't see why any man should get excited when he is asked about his hometown.
It may be important to you, M'sieu Giron--
M'sieu ...
M'sieu Monescu!
The tennis player. He saw me. He bowed. What could I do? I nodded.  Baron, I shouldn't have come!
No--no.
Why should you?
Gaston!
Right.
Darling!
I don't know. Fortunately, she has a dinner engagement tonight. I'll meet you at the station--midnight.  Hello ... Yes? What? ... You found a handbag? Well, you're three weeks too late! 
By the way, how is your German?
You <u>have</u> to get out of here!
That's what I'm here for--to get out! I want to get away from here, from you--as fast as I can and as far as a hundred thousand francs will take me.  Sixty-five, ninety-four--
Don't you <u>realize</u>--
Will you be good enough to look at this bag, madame? 
Yes.
Well--I am Madame Colet.
Do you realize I have light eyes?
No. What is it? Tell me.
As you like. 
It's disgraceful!
You're hired!
What are you going to do with my day tomorrow, M'sieu Laval?
Precisely.
Afraid I'm ruining your reputation, M'sieu Laval?
Like that?
So you think you can get me?
You're conceited--
<u>Shut</u> <u>up</u>--<u>kiss</u> <u>me</u>!  Wasting all this marvelous time with arguments! 
I <u>believe</u> you.
What would you say if you found your safe had been robbed?
Naturally not. But I expect the police to believe it. 
Wonderful ... But tomorrow morning, if you should wake out of your dreams and hear a knock, and the door opens, and there, instead of a maid with a breakfast tray, stands a policeman with a warrant--then you'll be glad you're alone.
Oh, madame, you're just too sweet for words! 
Mademoiselle Gautier--or whatever your name is--I thank you for your advice, but I must ask you to go. You've got your money--
Five compartments. She can stay afloat with the first four compartments breached. But not five. Not five. As she goes down by the head the water will spill over the tops of the bulkheads... at E Deck... from one to the next... back and back. There's no stopping it.
Thank you, Rose.
Take the elevator to the very bottom, go left, down the crewman's passage, then make a right.
I'm tryin' boss.
Lewis...
How it's going? It's going like a first date in prison, whattaya think?!
We're running out of time. And this strutting martinet...  ...isn't letting any men in at all.
So this is the ship they say is unsinkable.
He'll never amount to a thing, trust me. At least they were cheap.
That's right. Two things dear to me have disappeared this evening. Now that one is back...  ...I have a pretty good idea where to find the other.  Search him.
Maybe he did it while you were putting your clothes back on.
Tell her that her daughter died with the Titanic.
Sorry, you're not gonna see your mama again for a long time...
I prefer not to push the engines until they've been properly run in.
You're crazy.
It is that simple.
I see you.
Jack, I --
Sssshh. Come here.
Au contraire, mon cher.
This is crazy.
Now it's worse.
Right.
See if you can find a key for these. Try those drawers. It's a little brass one.
I didn't.  I just realized I already knew.
Right.
I promise. I will never let go, Jack. I'll never let go.
It's make the bergs harder to see, with no breaking water at the base.
That's enough.
It would be a nice change from you.
You're a charming liar. You <U>know</U>, Herbert's too dull to be suspicious about anything--even when I suddenly decided to come to Europe at a few hours' notice--
I never want to go back....
I can explain--
--and I can tell you where to get off.
Yes, yes--the air--  --I'm getting plenty of air.  Miss Marsh--Mrs. Rosson.
You were indiscreet enough to leave your gloves in my apartment one evening--  --and he was gentleman enough to boast <U>why</U> you'd been there and show me a snapshot of you.
Stick-up. Needed dough to get ashore.
Is that why you killed Lee Lother?
That depends on how mother's feeling. You'll excuse me, gentlemen?
Want to take it back?
Yes--are you?
So you washed it off!
You're not very ambitious, are you?
Well--breakfast?  Lunch?
Tell me.
But I'll have cocktails with you.
Let's forget it--can't you see I kind of like you, too ... and I don't want to get involved.
Yes--is it all right if I come like this? 
I'll watch for him, sir.
A thousand? She's one in a million--right off the top of the rosebush!
Why <U>didn't</U> I think of that?--I am going to scout around and see if I can find her.
No, sir?
A dollar forty--out of the two dollars I gave you.
Thank you, sir. 
Oh, is she? What a shame!  You'll pardon me?
See you later, Shortie--I'm off to the pool.
It's a pleasure.
Make it three, boys--I'll play this hand pat.
No, thanks--I never gambled in my life.
Swell!
It's a bet--come on, Sally!
Sure.
Then you don't have to tell her--cut out New York.
Sure.
This is a fine time to be asking that. You're on your way to France.
That's news to me. I'd better cable my wife.
Miss Marsh.
It's all right--if you like honest faces--let's have another drink--Steward!
Yes, a bracelet's been lost, but I'm still on my vacation.
I understand you searched Brett for it last night. By the way--what do you know about him?
Are you happy?
No--Inexperienced--  A red-headed kid--homemade clothes--Broadway was Paradise--and a slot at the Automat was a Banquet.
You made it possible for us to get away at a few hours' notice--you never asked why, but I guess you know.
Guess they're dull--nothing for you to reform.
Why don't you be a good little boy and leave her alone?
Somebody's got to do it--
H'mm--<U>Dear</U> Atlantic--
Never mind the Who's Who--Before I get on this boat I want to know What's What! How about my raise? All I get out of these ocean trips is dizzy.
Don't blame it on the ocean!--All right, you'll get the raise!
He works the boats as a "come-on" man. We ought to make a fair combination and do a little business. Jack's a pretty good dealer himself.
Better unlock the door.  Sit up, darling, and be dignified.
I've lost my taste for knickknacks--
For a very excellent reason from your own admission--  --I'm not saying you <U>did</U>--but I think you know more than you're telling. Years of experience have taught me to mistrust circumstantial evidence. Nevertheless, in your case there's plenty of it.
I mean--a lot of gentlemen would be offended if you searched them like that.
Nothin--  --I just remembered the name of a guy that owes me fifty bucks.
You saw him sitting out there in front, didn't you?
Ain't got time.
Isn't that a daisy?
Does it hurt?  A lot?  Good.
That's Wyatt Earp.  Made quite a Name for himself as a peace Officer in Kansas.
I saw that look pass between you And Wyatt at the fight.  Listen to Me!  You're mine!  Understand? You're my woman and I'm your man.
My man?  You told Wyatt you'd Disarmed those men.  Do you Actually believe after that I Could see you as my man?  You're Just a dirty little fixer.
Good.  That's real good.
Crack me back of the head like Some stinkin' bull.  Hell, you Ain't no fightin' man, you're Just a cop.
They were all gonna jump me back There.  What ever happened to one Against one?
Credat Judaeus Apella.
Here it come: one-two-
Bless you, darling  Darling!  Are you mad?  You're not Wearing a bustle.  How lewd!
I been having the boy at the Hotel pack us up every night Since your streak started
I'm a good woman to you, Doc. Don't I always take care of you? Nobody cares for you like me.  I'm A good woman.
Yes, I know.  You are a good woman.
But who was the Devil?
I don't know.  Probably ignore her.
Ignore her?
I'd ignore her.  People can Change, Doc.
I'll remember you said that.
I stand corrected.  Wyatt.  You're An oak.
I don't know.  It all happened so Fast.  If I'd had a chance to Think about it I guess I probably Would've been scared but... Swear To God, Doc, I just don't know.
A man like Ringo's got a great Empty hole right through the Middle of him and no matter what He does he can't ever fill it.  He Can't kill enough or steal enough Or inflict enough pain to ever Fill it.  And it drives him mad. Sick mad.  Cold and dirty.
Revenge?  For what?
How you feelin', Doc?
Rather an obvious question under The circumstances, don't you Agree?  A better one might be how Do you feel?
I imagine it would, yes.  So now We can add self-pity to your list Of frailties.
You think I'm kidding.  You're the Most fallible, wrong-headed, self- Deluding, just generally Benighted jackass I've ever Known.  Yet, withal, even at your Worst, you're the only human Being in my entire life who ever Gave me hope.
That's great coming from you.
Then what do I do?
Sheriff, may I present a pair of Fellow sophisticates, Turkey Creek Jack Johnson and Texas Jack Vermillion?  Watch your ear, Creek.
Then why in hell're you doin' This?  You ought to be in bed.
It rides right at 'em.  Like McMasters said, see it through to The end.
Oh...  Now she's starting.  How do they know?
I don't know, make some money, Have some kids, you know.
How would you know?
Well I ought to know my own mind And I'm tellin' you what suits me Is a family and kids.  That suits Me right down to the ground.  In Fact, that's my idea of heaven.  All right, what's your idea of heaven?
Fortuitous even.
You know you don't have to sneak. You could stay with me.  I know Things, Wyatt.  Sweet things.  I Could make you so happy.
Wait!
They're just lonely is all.  Hell, I howl myself sometimes.
Oh, all right.
Really?  You sure?
Forget it, Ringo.
'Least they don't scare women.
Look, I got a rule.  I don't talk To lawmen.  Dog-catchers neither.
Might as well hear him out. Anyways, what choice we got?  But no matter what happens, see It through to the end.  If you don't I'll curse the day I ever laid eyes on you.
I'll be damned...
Just his style, Morg.  Doesn't Mean anything.
Don't need to go heeled to get The bulge on a dub like you.
But she doted on the frowner
I know, I need a keeper.
Kinda, actually, yeah.  I gotta admit.
Wait a minute, you thinkin' of Getting in bed with the Cowboys?
Easy, Virge, they're just tryin' To egg us on.
You'll never make that stick.
Look at 'em all.  They love it. How in the hell'd we get Ourselves into this?
No, I gotta do something.  I don't Suppose you'd card-
None of my business, Fred.
I resent your tone, sir. I have men who are missing -
A piece of advice, Mr. Bond: Don't screw with a man who buys ink by the ton.  It's deadlier than uranium.
Fantastic idea Mr. Bond! Perhaps I should buy it for a book! It's totally preposterous, but -  You amuse me. ...And now perhaps I can amuse you.
- Instant melt-down.
Sometimes kill the crew; other times -  Torture them.
Did you test the auto-pilots? The satellite positioning receiver?
Guard! Arrest these men! Escort them to the cutter!
...That's all well and good, Captain, save for one thing:  There's no gold down there.
Is this another one of your games?
Why didn't you tell me? Why wasn't it in our files?
Q's retirement party. I'd just put the knife into the cake, and -
She married a hockey player.
I envy your 'undercover' assignments.
Spends his nights at the Kuala Lumpur yacht club.
Can you arrange a meeting?
That's reassuring.
Jack Wade. Citibank. Commercial loan division. If you're ever lookin' for a sweet refinance on the boat -
Interesting video tape.
No.
Chaperone. I'm waiting for my dinner date.
The Strait can be a very dangerous place, Mr. Bond. A few words scribbled on a piece of paper in London doesn't carry a lot of value out here. Including life insurance.
I hope so.
No. I want Sir Elliot to keep them.
You insist on calling all the shots.  And by the way: I am not a helpless girl.
If not?
First, that boat is in international waters. I'm claiming it for salvage. One-third of that gold is mine.
Only what I read in the newspapers.
I understand.
Good luck on your mission, 007.
No.
Send him a $10,000 campaign contribution, and explain I have no control over what my journalists write -
I see you two have met.
You come with me -  You stay here.
Fueled and waiting.
Good. We have an appointment in Hong Kong.
Get more men up there!
I should have hired this man.  Get somebody up there!
...Haven't we already paid him for his services?
...But because I am a just man, I've decided to give Mr. Hussein what he deserves.
How come you're not wearing my shoes?
I bet you if your master would have told you to fix the hole in the roof, you would have rebuilt the whole damn house.
You always got the best of it around here and when Dad always talks about my son, it is always you, so you fix the roof.
I want Sunny to have an advantage that you and I never had, but he needs discipline, and you are not helping when I tell him to do something and you allow him to get out of it.
What is a sip of coffee going to do?
I told him we might not need it, if you can talk your parents into giving you your share of the property.
We could borrow on that land and put the money to work.
It's like I've been swimming in muddy waters.
It was like all those things old country people try to tell you what hell is like.
This doesn't make any sense; you are going to drag that poor boy out in the cold air.
I've heard some foolish things in my life.
That is called a crab apple switch. It's for those bad acting monkeys and just the thing for a mean dog. Now I don't know if I actually did what I did or got my life and story mixed in with other folk's stories but I seem to recall that I had to use my crab apple on a boy from back home. I was up in Memphis working on the railroad, like your daddy who had an easy job. He would sing a song that had a cadence and we would lay track. Anyway I was coming down Beale Street and I heard this music coming from a saloon. Sure enough it was Emory. My daddy taught both of us to play but Emory was natural at it. Got in a blues band and what not. He and another boy had killed a boy named Hocker sometime back and they balled the Jack leaving town. Emory had lost one eye and had a scar running down his face. Bad luck I would say. He got to drinking that corn liquor. We went to his girl's room and he wouldn't stop drinking. He started talking about the old days and he went mad. He pulled his knife and I got to mine first. The lights went out.
Boy, that is the real South. That is real corn liquor.
I always had chickens, ducks and whatnots.
Not anymore, not in the city.
I'm trying to make him a man but you keep babying him.
Oh, I would feel much at home if you let me get one for you. I haven't wrung a chicken's neck in a month of Sundays. You know, folks would call my daddy to kill their hogs. That used to be my trade from time to time.
It was slow. Now it seems like everyone is having births at home.
'Course, you could be right. Your sons are alive. All my sons are dead.
She has a fish bone caught in her throat. Could all of you go in the other room? Gideon, get some bread and toast it quickly and find me the cod liver oil.
He wasn't able to get out of bed today.
Let me earn my keep. I'll go out and get a hen and have it picked and ready for the pot. Try to make him some cow tea next time.
I don't make no bones about where I'm going to spend eternity. I have always been wild and you know that. If you are made to feel half a man, what do you think the other half is?
Miss Clara's boy, Emory, to start with. The Johnson's Hocker was another one...
Of course not. Have you ever heard of a man jumping in the river to save five hundred drowning people? No you ain't.  You have to take just one and fatten him up. When you spread help too thin, you , you just nickel and dime the situation. If you try to save all, all die but if you save one life, life goes on. You just have to remember, medicine that works leaves a bitter taste.
That is a boy from home, Lulla's brother.
I let this rabbit foot do in place of my toby that I lost years ago.
I haven't heard anyone mention Swamp Root since button-up shoes went out.
Rush your mouth, girl. No, he didn't. He cannot be that big of a damn fool.
I can't accuse him just dry long 80.
I was just trying to make conversation.
Oh, this looks GREAT, Mom!
You can bring ONE toy...
But Mom, I can't find him!
He's not here, Mom.  Woody's gone.
What?  What is it?
I wanted to thank you, Woody, for saving my flock.
T-O-Y.  Toy.
No, you can't.
Can't!  Can't!  Can't!
Oh, yeah, tough guy?!
Buzz, I would love to see you try.  'Course I'd love to see you as a crater.
Oh, yeah?  Well, if YOU hadn't shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything that was important to me --
Hyper-active hyperdrive, and astro...uh, turf.
Still no word from Star Command. We're not that far from the spaceport --
No, it is.  Look, over in that house is a kid who thinks you are the greatest, and it's not because you're a Space Ranger, pal, it's because you're a TOY!  You are HIS toy.
Not today!
This isn't flying.  This is falling -- with style!
Have you been replaced?
All right, that's enough.  Look, we're all very impressed with Andy's new toy --
That's Mr. Potato Head to you, you back-stabbin' murderer!
Toss 'im overboard!
No, no, no, wait!
I was close to being scared that time.
But what if Andy gets another dinosaur?  A mean one?  I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection.
Yes SIR!
So did I tell ya?  Huh?  Nothing to worry about.
Go away.
Finn -
You did what?
I hope he doesn't pick on Jonathon.
H'm?
So had I.
Storms?
Is she in any kind of therapy... professional help?
Why are you talking like that?
Laundromats for the washing of money. Unfortunately, Carl had only one successful business.
Don't you have some good news?  Isn't there something positive you could say.
I tried, Arnie.  And, I will continue to try.
I need an introduction to the Obregon Brothers.
It's so frustrating.
Yeah, because the alternative is to be bored to death.
She'll be at a pawn shop in an hour.
Honey, your father knows the President.
That makes mom the Czarina.  I'm a Czarette.  Like Anastasia.
Just watching you.
I get A's.  All A's.
She knows Arnie Metzger.
Winners don't do coke.  Or haven't you been reading the bumper stickers?
Your friends at Warren, Putnam and Hudson.
No --
Especially Tiger Woods.  ...Actually, he keeps his on the back seat.
You're kidding.  Can't you shoot him or something?
There's always a way.  If people get to the Pope or the President, you can get to him.
Nobody said shit, Eduardo --
I am a legitimate business.  Fishing boats.  Tuna.  Check it out.  Tax records, everything --
You will dine with me from now on.
They wouldn't do it in front of all these people.  They'd send someone later, when we're alone.
What?
What is it you want me to do?
A small thing.  Nothing really.
But will he be house-trained?
Any idea how much?
What do you look for?
Just tell me where she is.
Oh, man --
She hasn't called you?
I'd like to bring you up to Washington, walk you around our side of things, and share some of the information we've been able to develop on your cartels.
I see where you're going with that, but if I could just say something, which is basically that a guy like Landry is so autocratic he doesn't know how to let himself be helped; it's a point of pride to take every bullet, no matter who fired it, or whether it was even aimed at him, which personally I think it very self-defeating.  Now, don't get me wrong, he's a man of enormous integrity, but there's a political component to this job that the General just didn't have any patience for.
Right.  Now it's used by somebody from the Juarez Cartel, one of his lieutenants...  Who knows?  Every damn day there's birthday party. At first I thought they must have three hundred children, then I realized they're taunting us.  Three miles away and we can't touch them. Ha, ha, ha.
It's three a.m.  I'm not supposed to be here.  I snuck out --
No. On you go.
You've stabbed me, man.
You were in my way.
All down my fucking front, you fucking idiot.
Thanks.
I'll come back if you like, but I'm not promising anything.
No, not holding hands.
Can I see you again?
Whatever. I mean, the guy's dead anyway.
So why have you told me about it?
It's an interesting theory.
Do you recall the school motto?
Strive, hope, believe and conquer.
You were referred here by the Department of Employment. There's no need for you to get you "foot in the door", as you put it.
No problem for me either.  Honestly, it's no problem.
Following the game at all?
But try too hard --
So who else?
What?
He made me lick it.
Cut it out.
I know a couple of addicts. Stupid wee lassies. I feed them what they need. A little bit of skag to keep them happy while the punters line up at a fiver a skull. It's easy money for me. Not exactly a fortune, but I'm thinking, 'I should be coining it here.'  Less whores, more skag. Swanney's right. Get clean, get into dealing, that's where the future lies. Set up some contacts, get a good load of skag, punt it, profit. What do you think?
Why would I want to sell my passport?
It was just an idea.
About four kilos. So he tells me. Got drunk in a pub down by the docks last week, where he met two Russian sailors. They're fucking carrying the stuff. For sale there and then, like. So he wakes up the next morning, realizes what he's done and get very fucking nervous. Wants rid of this. {---------- He's looking for Swanney to punt it, but Swanney's nowhere to be seen since he lost his leg. ---------- }
Four Grand.
Sure, sure. I've heard it before.
Look, Tommy, we know you're getting a hard time off Lizzy, but there's no need to take it out on us.
I don't know, Tommy. I don't know if it's... normal.
New course? You have no authority.  What's going on here?
Let us explore it together.
But how?
Very well, Mr. Scott. Carry on.
If we could send a distress signal...
Put it on the veiwscreen, would You please?
Transporter room. Status.
Go, Sulu.
Yes, Spock?
Life is not a dream.
I cannot be certain.
But he does seem familiar?
If I had pulled the trigger, Sybok would be dead.
Look, the man may be a fellow Vulcan, but that doesn't...
I was not disposed to discuss... matters of a personal nature. For that, I'm sorry.
Sybok possessed the keenest intellect I have ever known.
"c."... "k."
Mark two. Request emergency assistance. Acknowledge.
I was thinking of Sybok. I've lost a brother.
Sybok, listen to me. In order for this craft to enter the landing bay, Enterprise must lower the shields and activate the tractor beam. To get us inside and re-raise the shields will take-
I'm afraid of nothing.
Now learn something about yourself.
Your vision?


Uhura, I thought you were on leave.
You haven't told him?
Uh... got any cinnamon?
Yes, won't that be grand -- the computers will start thinking, and people will stop. Lora, I'm going to stay and run some data through. See you tomorrow.
So... Nice ship you got here. What's our next move?
Let's get outta here.
I think we'd better shut off all access till we can find that file. Just to be safe.
Cute.
I can't afford to have an independent program monitoring me. Do you have any idea how many outside systems I've gone into? How many programs I've appropriated?
What do you want with the Pentagon?
The same thing I want with the Kremlin. I'm bored with corporations. With the information I can access, I can run things 900 to 1200 times better than any human.
Greetings, program...
Yeah, I... oops!
It's time I levelled with you, Tron. I'm a -- well, I'm what you guys call a User.
I hate to disappoint you, pal, most-the time, that's how it is for Users, too.
Shhhhh.
PARAMUS... wonder what those initials stand for ...  ...probably Program Assist Routine -- well, it sounds like a lovely place.
It grows on you.
Good luck. You can't even think in here.
I've got a little challenge for you, Sark -- a new recruit. He's a tough case, but I want him treated in the usual manner. Train him for the games... let him hope for a while... and blow him away.
How?
Mom, wake up!  Dad barely knows we exist.
Yeah, Dad.
Why?  So I can wind up like you? What's the point?
Unbelievable!  Trent told me he wrote it.  He's history.
You're kidding.
Roger, One.  Rolling.
Why?
Don't be ridiculous.  She's only -- how old is she?
Uh huh.  Want me to lose them?
Hardcore, highly fanatical, ultra-				* fundamentalist.  Linked to					* numerous car-bombings, that cafe				* bomb in Rome, and the 727 out of Lisbon last year.  Major player.				*
Something to do with Helen, is what I'm getting.
Sure, Harry.  I'm on it.
What about that time you trashed a six-week operation because you were busy getting a blow-job?
Oh shit.  Harry... what're you doing?
Yes sir.
Uh, yes, it is important.
Juno.  I wish I could say it's a pleasure to see you again.
Oral hygiene?
Not exactly.
I'll just be a second.  So what happened tonight at the office?
Yeah.  It was a rush thing.  They needed some documents down at the court house.  I barely made it.
Three days later, he called me. He told me to meet him at Overlook Park.
Why?
Yes.
Think carefully.  You will be lying to the man you love.  The person who trusts you the most.
No.  Doris.
I'm not wearing any.
Let the hooker go.  She's not important.
I don't take those assignments.
So you're basically lying your ass off the whole time?  I couldn't do it.
Wait!  You got the wrong guy.  My name's Simon.  Look, just let me go.  There's no need to kill me. I haven't seen your--
Kettleman, Barnes and McGrath. I'm a legal secretary.
Of course.  Mrs. Tasker.  And what were you going with the international terrorist, Carlos the Jackal?  Taking dictation?
Uh... well, okay then.  You sound terrible.  I'll run out right now.  Just call the prescription in to the pharmacy.  Sure, no problem.  Bye.
No, my dear, he is a federal agent.  He killed two of my colleagues the other night.
Hold that thought.
Fuck you.
The same place.  One o'clock.  I have to go now.  See you tomorrow.  Remember, I need you.
Sometimes a story is a mask for a covert operation.  See-- two men killed in a restroom, and two unidentified men in a running					* shootout, ending at the						* Marriot...
You recognized my style.  See, you're very good.  You're a natural at this.
I know.  But it would compromise your safety too much to know certain things.
Not here.  I'll call you and we'll rendezvous again.  We have to leave separately, so we aren't seen together.  For your safety.
Yes.  Now go.
What is it you need me to do?
Here.  Sit down.  Be comfortable.
I just glances inside.
Yeah, my room-mate leaves it on the TV.
I didn't get any chicken.
He ain't so much good guy as he's just a bad motherfucker. Sonny don't be bullshittin'. He fucks dudes up for life. Hold on, a fight scene's coming up.
How 'bout me what?
What's your favorite movie star?
That's a long time.
Well, we sell other things too. Cool stuff. "Man from U.N.C.L.E." Lunch boxes. "Green Hornet" board games. Shit like that. But comic books are main business. There's a lot of collectors around here.
I dunno. I guess I'm just stupid.
Did you hurt yourself?  Whatd'ya do? Step on a thumbtack?
"Heroes For Sale"?
Who and what is a Drexl?
Is he black?
Well, I wouldn't go so far as to call him nice, but he's treated me pretty decent. But I've only been there about four days. He got a little rough with Arlene the other day.
What did he do to Arlene?
You better not be fuckin' teasin' me.
I don't believe so.
Thank you.
I just gotta get somethin'.
No, Clarence. Just forget it, babe. I just wanna disappear from there.
What?
Nigger, I eat everything. I eat pussy. I eat the butt. I eat every motherfuckin' thang.
Can you live with it?
You wanna get unhaunted?
I don't blame you.
She's with me.
I'm her husband.
Well, you're gonna be seein' me shortly.
Get the fuck outta here!
Just like in Detroit, only skinnier.
Good for you.
Would you just shut up a minute and let me think?
I'm just makin' sure we got everything.  You got yours?
No, I don't really mean it. Well, I mean, this is our last chance to think about it. How 'bout you, Bama?
This is our last chance to play "what if". I want to do it. I'm just scared of getting caught.
When he was alive. I wouldn't fuck him now.
The police department?
He trusts you?
Then why are you telling me all this bullshit just so you can fuck me?
What's waiting for us up there. Tell me or I'll pump two right in your face.
The biggest. The biggest movie you've ever dealt with, Lee. We're talkin' a lot of film. A man'd have ta be an idiot not to be a little cautious about a movie like that. And Lee, you're no idiot.
I don't think that'll be necessary. Let's all have a seat. Boris, why don't you be nice and get coffee for everybody.
A Norms in Van Nuys.
Bastards. That's why I always eat at Lawreys.
Anything stronger?  Oh, probably not. Beer? You can drink beer, can't you?
Uh, yeah... there's a party store down 54th.
She seems very nice.
Apparently, Drexl had a big toe stuck in shit like that.
I've heard of Blue Lou Boyle.
Now I can't be sure of how much of what he told you. So in the chance you're in the dark about some of this, let me shed some light. That whore your boy hangs around with, her pimp is an associate of mine, and I don't just mean pimpin', in other affairs he works for me in a courier capacity. Well, apparently, that dirty little whore found out when we're gonna do some business, 'cause your son, the cowboy and his flame, came in the room blastin' and didn't stop till they were pretty sure everybody was dead.
I don't believe you.
Yeah, and the restaurant's on my route. And you know, I stuck my nose in for the company to try to put a stop to some of these break-ins. Now, while I have no proof, the name Drexl Spivey kept comin' up Who's case is it?
You and Robin moved?
Where'd you come from?
Absolutely.
I don't know. He just appeared as magic.
And just think, when you get out in a few years, you'll meet some girl, get married, and you'll be so understanding to your wife's needs, because you'll know what it's like to be a woman.
To front for him. So Elliot is workin' out the deal between them and his boss, a big movie producer named Lee Donowitz.
We have to show in court that, without a doubt, a successful man, an important figure in the Hollywood community, is also dealing cocaine.
You do.
He knows something's up.
This guy's gonna kill him.
Read my lips.
How do you know? You been there?
Where's that?
Shut your mouth. Nick Cardella was provin' what his words was worth before you were in your daddy's nutsack. What sun do you walk under you can throw a shadow on Nick Cardella? Nick Cardella's a stand-up guy.
I think it was...I'm sure it was 2nd Street.
I got into trouble.  I got arrested. But I still got you a specimen -- a spider -- but I didn't have anyplace to put it, so I ate it.  It was the wrong year anyway, so I guess it doesn't matter.
That the virus was taken from Philadelphia to San Francisco, then to New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking.
Why not?  Most people have some ID.
A jail?  Prison?
What year do you think it is?
I did him a favor.  Now come on.
Shot!  Who shot you?
Give me the gun.
You mean, treat me?  Cure me?  Kathryn, those words on the wall -- I've seen them before...  I...I...dreamed them.
No, not really.  It's...it's in my mind.  Like you said.
You had a bullet from World War One in your leg, James!  How did it get there?
You said I had delusions -- that I created a world -- you said you could explain everything...
James...do you remember...six years ago...you had a phone number!  You tried to call and...
A Carpet Cleaning Company?
I have seen it, but I don't remember this part.  Funny, it's like what's happening to us, like the past.  The movie never changes -- it can't change -- but everytime you see it, it seems to be different because you're different -- you notice different things.
Airports all look the same.  Maybe it's...  James!  Your moustache!  It's slipping.
So you could talk to these scientists and they do what?  Send you to the future?
Why don't I escape, that's what you were going to ask me, right?  'Cause I'd be crazy to escape!  I'm all taken care of, see?  I've sent out word.
I've managed to contact certain underlings, evil spirits, secretaries of secretaries, and assorted minions, who will contact my father. When he learns I'm in this kind of place, he'll have them transfer me to one of those classy joints where they treat you...properly. LIKE A GUEST!  LIKE A PERSON!  SHEETS! TOWELS!  LIKE A BIG HOTEL WITH GREAT DRUGS FOR THE NUT CASE LUNATIC MANIAC DEVILS...
Wiping cut the human race!  That's a great idea!  But it's more of a long term thing -- right now we have to focus on more immediate goals.  I didn't say a word about "you know what".
I'm here about some monkeys.
How did you find me?
Who am I supposed to shoot?
Well, the guard woke me up.  He told me I volunteered.
I didn't think I was being defensive. I was just...
And what we believe is what's accepted as "truth" now, isn't it, Owen?  Psychiatry -- it's the latest religion.  And we're the priests -- we decide what's right and what's wrong --we decide who's crazy and who isn't. ... I'm in trouble, Owen.  I'm losing my faith.
She knew about it, Jeffrey.  She knew you were going to try this.
Tight?  My watch says 7:30.
I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun from your eyes.
Christ no!
Change?  You want my change?  I fought the war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change?
What the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?
I won't hold my breath.
Afraid of it?  Boy, I live in the dark.  People are afraid of what they can't see.  I can't see nuthin', so it's all the same to me. Kiss from a beautiful woman, a lick from a dog.  The kiss of death. It's all the same.
Same back at you.
Where to?
'Cause Harlin used to own it.
But he's dead.
Somewhere else?  Mister somewhere else is fifty miles from here.  How you planning on getting it there? You gonna push this heap yourself?
Jesus.  Twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already.
Nothing.
Listen, man.  I got rolled half and hour ago for everything I had.
One of those days you feel like you been runnin' in circles and you ain't no closer to where you tryin' to get than when you started?
That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.
No charge.
Yep.  For the hose.  But while you was gone I replaced a gasket. That's going to run you another fifty.
I'm taking my car, and I'm taking it now!
You listen to me, you fancy city man.  You owe me money, and this car ain't going nowheres until I get it. And if you take another five hours I'll find another fifty dollars worth of work to do on her.  Now get out of here!  You're stinking up my garage.
Open up!
Kirin?
Same thing you want.  I want to be out of Sierra; to be able to do as I please.  But that takes money.
Who the hell is this!?
I'm just going to my car.
May I carry your package, Grace?
You should be more careful.
That's all right.  I got it.
You're welcome, Grace.
If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.
Somewhere else.  I've never been anywhere else.  Just once.  Years ago.  Went to the state fair.  It was nice, but it wasn't nothing.
Good, 'cause I liked what I saw.
Like you.
Like they're made of polyester.
Depends on what you call love.  When I was growing up I had nothing.  I learned to want everything.  I wanted more than Sierra anyway. Jake was my ticket.  He's not much; he's older than me, different than me, but he's got more money than half this town put together.  I courted him.  I let him think he was courtin' me, but I reeled him in like a fish on a line.  I wanted him.  I wanted what he could give me, and I would've done anything to get him.  Is that love?
I'm still here, aren't I?  See this?
Take me with you.
Lied?  What do you mean?
I think this heat is making me crazy.  I was crazy to come back here, I'm crazy for listening to anyone in this town, and I'd sure as hell be crazy if I spent another minute in this place.
What are you talking about?
Is it so bad?  It would be quick. He wouldn't even have to feel it.
The only reason I stormed off is because you sort of spooked me talking about Jake.  But I've had nothing but time to think about it. It keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here. But we've got to get the money, baby.  We get the money, I get the car, then we get the hell out.
I'm not sure where it is.  Not exactly.  I never saw it.  I just heard him talk about it.
There isn't!  There's nothing under here but more floor.  Jesus fucking Christ!  We killed a man for nothing but floor.
This is good.  This is real good. This is so good they might not even charge us with murder when they catch us.  They'll probably just lock us up for being idiots.
Grace!  Just . . . let me handle this.  Sheriff, I'm telling you there's nothing in that trunk.  If that's not good enough for you, then I'd be happy to open it.  Just as soon as you get yourself a search warrant.
Now what?
I don't want to go to Mexico, John. I want to be with you.  Don't you think I care about you?
I think I busted my leg.
What for?
I've got to make a stop in Vegas, then I'm heading to Santa Barbara.
Live there?
I hope so.  Listen, Mr. McKenna, about your wife:  If I had known she was married--
It wouldn't have made a difference to you, now would it?  Not a wit. Do you know why?  Because you're a man without scruples.
I was hoping we could talk.
Talk?  About what?
I do.
This morning I didn't know how badly I'd want to get out of this fucking town.
You love her, but you hate her?
You could say.  I don't even have it yet.
Maybe you heard old Jake's got some money stashed away and you thought you'd help yourself to a little.
There's another reason?  It better be good.
It's the truth, Jake.
Damn it, Jake.  If I don't get out of here some guys are going to come gunning for me.  And if it comes down to me or Grace, then I pick Grace.  You were going to give me thirteen-thousand.  Give me two- hundred.  I'll kill her and dump the body where no one will ever find it. But I need the money.  I've got to have the money.
This morning when I came in on you and Grace, you swore you hadn't so much as been near the bedroom.  Now you make straight for it.
Come on, Jake--
Christ, Jake, please--
A drifter, a loner, a trouble maker like you?  Just passing through town, need money so he busts in on an, old man.  Only this old man's got himself an automatic, and he knows how to use it.  A man's got to protect his home.  His wife.  You're dead, boy, and your own mother wouldn't convict me.
Not from where I stand.
Think about it.  How do you think I got in here?  Did you hear any glass break?  Did you hear a door splinter?  How did the evening end? After you went to bed did she linger a bit?  Maybe just long enough to leave the back door unlocked?  Is that what happened?
How about I pick one out for you?
You're too quick for me.
That's what I thought until you came riding in.  I saw your car over at the gas station.  It's cool.  Want to take me for a ride?  Desert's kind of lonely this time of day.
How old are you?
What's your name anyway?
What?  You want to fight?  Over her?
I know, Mr. Vesci.  I know.  I was on my way to you, it's just . . . what a day I've had.  You're not going to believe what's happened to me. I had the money, I swear I had it. I was on my way to you when my car breaks down in the middle of nowhere.
Maybe not for you, Sheriff, but I think I've had my fill of your little town.
Not taking a drive, Sheriff. Heading out of town.
Suppose you've had all you can of Sierra.  What with that ruckus you had with Toby.  Oh yes, I heard all about that.
Just step from the car.  Nice and slow.
And as soon as I see that you're on your way.
You can't do that yourself?
Hell no, I can't do that myself.  I'm blind.  Can't you see that?
Christ no!
Nothing makes the Great Spirit laugh harder than a man's plans. We all got plans. I planned on seeing all my life. I know you didn't plan on straying into town.
Mister, I'm calling you out.
This means something to you?  Jenny means something to me.
Grace, tell him.
Oh? Darrell taking good care of you?
You a sailor man?  That'd be the life. Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away.  A man could pretty well disappear like that.  Just sail away until all he was was a memory.  I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.
No, I hate loving her. I hate the kind of person she is. I hate having to tolerate the little "games" she plays. Like fucking half of the town behind my back and laughing at me. The bitch. She loved to play. She wants me to hit her and when I hit her she likes it. She tortures me. But she's family. She's my little girl. My baby. I couldn't stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath, or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull. No. Not me. But you? You got the killing in you, boy...How much you want?
I know you're not surprised I'm back here, cause you can read my mind and all.
It's not what you think, Jake.
You know what kind of woman Grace is, Jake. You know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of Superior.  What's she to you, Jake; a woman who wants you dead?  Let me kill her.  All I want is two-hundred dollars to get out of here with.
What's your name anyway?
Get away from me!
Great!
How much time?
Jesus.  Twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already.
Another accident?  You got to be more careful.
That's a Ford, not a Ferrari.  You going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford?
What's that got to do with the radiator hose?
What sign? Fuck the sign. I want my car.
One of those days you feel like you been runnin' in circles and you ain't no closer to where you tryin' to get than when you started?
Yep.  For the hose.  But while you was gone I replaced a gasket.  That's going to run you another fifty.
Well, now, you just know all there is about bein' a mechanic, don't you?  Didn't you read the sign.
You got the money?
Maybe I don't want you to.
Accident.
Oh, this isn't my car.  It's down a ways. I should have parked closer.  I just didn't think it would be so heavy.  I could drive up.
And here I've made you all hot and sweaty.
I don't know.  I have to make a stop in Vegas.  Business to finish.  Then maybe I'll head to Santa Barbara.  I might be able to pick up some action there.
I guess.  I've got an ego same as any man.
I guess it must.
Maybe I like to find out about a man first. Maybe I like to know what he's made of.
Nothing.
Try me.
What do you mean?
It's not like he's a young man, Bobby. He's had time to live. It'd be quick. I mean, he wouldn't even have to <u>feel</u> it...  I mean, sometime in the middle of the night, when it's quiet...when he's asleep, you could just come up behind him when he's pounding on me and...
I thought you couldn't get your car.
I could if I had Jake's money.
You said you couldn't kill anybody.
Then will you take me on your friends' boat with you?
I'm not sailing his boat.
He was in love with you Grace. He would've done what you wanted, you could've made a deal and ...
You lied to me all along! Lies, all lies. Your mother, your father, what story are you on now?  How come the town didn't know you was his daughter?
Harlin's.
Get in.
One way.
No, we ain't got no Heineken.  We got Miller.
Sure, I'll try.
You never said anything.  About the drapes.
They look nice.
You shut your mouth, girl, and get back over to our table.  Now, I'm not going to axe you again, Mister.  What were you doing with my girl?
I am Russian, da! I am also <u>rich</u> Russian, da? Maybe we work something out, my friend Sheriff?
What fuckin grocery store, you fucking shithead idiot! You call yourself a police...
Is Noel in?
You've made a considerably wise decision.
Do you remember me getting sick?
That's strange isn't it? Not remembering one fever... Or a cold... Or a sore throat. What do you think that means?
What was that?
Jeremy.  I'm going in. I have to do some things.
There's nothing to do.
What if you only ate foods that were good for you and you worked out everyday for a year?
I'm not. I just didn't connect it.
Jeremy if you pull that trigger I'm going to leave! I'm going to go to New York.
No.
You can't do anything about that. You might fall between that chair and this television. If that's what God has planned for you, that's what's going to happen. You can't hide from it in your room.
You told them cowboys you had it.
What did you think, they come clear up from Kansas to fuck us?
A wise policy. But if you did, I can assure you, the sight of royalty would cause you to dismiss all thoughts of bloodshed and stand... in awe.  Whereas, a president... I mean, why not shoot a president?
Little Bill come out of Kansas an' Texas, boys. He worked them tough towns.
Yeah, I guess.  There's still a payment, ain't there?
Uh... yeah. Yeah. She's uh... watchin' over the little ones.
Well, I was always tasting the soup two hours after I et it.
Uh... a little, maybe.
...They been fuckin' 'em, 'an tellin' every bow-legged one of 'em how they're payin' a thousand dollars to whatever sonofabitch kills them two boys which cut up Delilah.
You know how women kin lie... I knock 'em around a little, ask 'em where the money is, they say they don't have none?... but they coulda squirreled away that much, the five of 'em. Maybe. 
Well... uh... I... I ain't got no, uh, firearms.
You're spillin' your whiskey, mister.
Like I said, I...
I have done that... killed women and children... I have killed most everything that walks or crawls an' now I have come to kill you, Little Bill, for what you done to Ned.  Now step aside. boys.
Uh... I can assure you, Mister Daggett... the events described within are based... on the accounts of eye witnesses and...
Well, Mister Beauchamp, I was at the Blue Bottle Saloon in Wichita the night English Bob killed Corky Corcoran... an' I didn't see you there... nor no woman, nor no twogun shooters nor nothin' like that.
No,... but I can't abide them kind... an' you will find a lot of them in the saloons... tramps an' drunk teamsters an' crazy miners... sportin' pistols like they was bad men, but not having no sand nor character... not even bad character.
Nobody didn't kill Ned, he went South yesterday. He didn't even kill nobody. Why would anybody kill Ned?
Little Bill. The... the Bar T boys caught him and Little Bill...
N-no. He... he beat him up. He was making him... answer questions... and beating him up... and then... Ned just died.  Little Bill didn't mean to kill him... he said he was sorry an' all... but he said it was a good example anyhow.
A cowboy come in sayin' you killed Quick Mike in the shit house at the Bar T...
Huh?
If you was to change your mind, might be you could catch me... due West to the Western Trail an' North to Ogallala.
Wasn't nothin' said about no partner.
Sorry, Ned. Guess I wasted your time. See ya, Kid!
What rocks? Why don't you shoot? What's goin' on?
You missed him? You didn't...?
Well, I gu-guess they had it... comin'.
Stay clear of folks you might see. There's plenty out lookin' to hang you. Go on now, skedaddle.
Easy, huh? Hell, I don't know that it was all that easy then... an' we was young an' full of beans.  Bill... if you was mad at 'em... if they done you wrong... I could see shootin' 'em...
Yeah, an' I could still hit a bird in the eye flyin'.
It ain't nothin', don't fret it.  She don't like it much, you goin' off with me.
You was a... a crazy sonofabitch.
Quincy, he was always watchin' me. Scared.
Whaddaya do, just use your hand?
IS THAT YOU, KID?
Why would the Kid shoot at us?
Supposin' he don't go to the ranch?
Only he wasn't carryin' no pistol this time.
Well, I come back, didn't I?
I guess you didn't kill nobody then.
Well, you was shootin' every which way an'...
How many men you killed?  Ain't you gonna answer?
Move the candle closer, I can't see.
That ain't what I mean.
He says they were buying It doesn't make sense. I'm sorry, I'm a little rusty. They were there to buy something.
He says the hair is longer and lighter.
I love you.
I don't know what you came here for, but we won't have any part of it.
Edie, please.
A hijacker like Dean, here? Or something more creative?
I don't know. Who was that guy that used to talk about Soze in New York?
I don't know. This is bad.
You are a criminal.
Why you gotta go and do that? I'm trying to make a point.
Then who goes?
Tough break.
No killing?
What if I
Mr. Soze made a few calls, yes. You were not to be released until I came to see you. It seems Mr. Keaton's attorney, Ms. Finneran, was a bit too effective in expediting his release. Holding the rest of you became a moot point.
Mr. Redfoot knew nothing. Mr. Soze rarely                 t works with the same people for very long, and they never know who they're working for. One cannot be betrayed if one has no people.
You're lying.
Where?
No matter. He'll have to know how close we came.
Keyser Sate or not, if Keaton's alive he'll never come up again.
You know Ruby is in Attica?
And why leave this out when you talked to the D.A.?
You tell me, Agent Kujan. If I told you the Loch Ness Monster hired me to hit the harbor, what would you say?
His own people were selling him to a gang of Hungarians. Most likely the same Hungarians that Sate all but wiped out back in Turkey. The money wasn't there for dope. The Hungarians were going to buy the one guy that could finger Soze for them.
This is all bullshit.
Four cases in three years ...
... tell me about this case.
All right.  But let's keep the price down.  I've called Ed Concannon.  He recommends that we continue to respond as if we're going to trial.
That was our insurance company's recommendation.
... that was a Dr. David Gruber's office ...
When she...
Tell me one?
Well, we...
Tell us.
...to get her heartbeat back...?
And you would come here, and on a slip of memory four years ago, you'd ruin their lives.
I am seventy-four years old.
Nothing further, your Honor.
You would not...?
You know these doctors could have settled out of court.  They wanted a trial.  They wanted to clear their names.
What you thought!?  What you thought...I'm a workingman, I'm trying to get my wife out of town, we hired you, we're paying you, I got to find out from the other side they offered two hundred...
These people play very rough. They don't want to lose this case. There's a lot of pressure they can bring to bear, I...
No.  No.  Thank you. You go home.
) I'm sorry ...?
...you got your doctor's testimony. Why do you need me?
Who put my client in the hospital for life.
I do.  Who is it?  The Doctors. What do you owe them?
I had a witness disappear on me.
Are you done?
I have to reach him.  This is an emergency.  Could you give me his home number?
Still looking.
And what are you?  A cop?
I'm a lawyer.
My name's Frank.  And furthermore, you came back to see me tonight.
No, no, I'm just...
And what makes you so tough?
... I get these people to trust you --they're coming here tomorrow by the way --I get this expert doctor to talk to you.  I'm doing all your fuckin' legwork -- and it's eighteen months.  You're 'sposed to be in court.  I bet you haven't even seen the file.
Don't touch anything.
I've got my Dr. Gruber, says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anaesthetic anyway, plus she came in complaining of stomach pains...
Okay now.  Cases:  Smith versus State of Michigan.
Right.
How old are you, how many children ... when did you last eat ...
The Hospital...?
... and I have inquiries out to doctors, experts in the field ... there is, of course, a problem getting a doctor to testify that another doctor's negligent ...
We, yes.  Yes.  They, they present their side, and I get the same chance.  To cross-examine... to... to...
You live in the neighborhood?
Who told you that?
Yeah.
Yes.
...they start again three minutes earlier...
We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro...
Why did it take that long to get her heartbeat...
The Big Boy did...?
That Frank was working on.  Yeah. He thought Franky needed some help, so they bribed a juror.  So Franky finds out.  He comes to me in tears. He thinks that anybody who knows what a 'spinnaker' is got to be a saint.  I told him ' Franky, wake up.  These people are sharks. What do you think they got so rich from?  Doing good?'  He can't be comforted.  He tells the boys at Stearns and Harrington they've disappointed him, he's going to the Judge to rat them out.
Before he can get there here comes this Federal Marshal, and Franky's indicted for Jury tampering, they throw him in jail, he's gonna be disbarred, his life is over.   Jimmy, gimme another drink.    How are you?
I'd like to have lived here then. The color and excitement... the power...  the freedom.
No, I'm all right.
The speedometer of her car showed she had driven 94 miles that day. Where did she go?  I have to know, Scottie. Where she goes and what she does, before I got involved with doctors.
Ernie's.
All right.  You won't know what to look for at first, Scottie. Even I, who know her so well, cannot tell, sometimes, when the change has begun. She looks so lovely and normal...
Nothing.
Why did she never tell her daughter?
No. She's in fine shape. Nothing to worry about. But she doesn't know. You understand that. She doesn't know what she did.
Listen, I'm going to yell in a minute!
I'm not going to hurt you! I promise! Please!
You're not far wrong.
Just a girl, I work at Magnin's --
I told you! Right here!
I want to know who you are.
Then will you for me?
Tomorrow m -- but I have to go to work. I've got a job.
And what will I live on? My oil wells in Texas?
I suppose I could phone the store in the morning, and say I'm sick.
No, there. There's a good one. Do you like that?
But why?
It's a horrible idea! Is that what I'm here for? To make you feel that you're with someone that's dead?
Judy, you've got to do this for me! Please!
You've got a thing about Ernie's, haven't you?
Well, after all, it's "our place."
I need you.
Scottie --
Your accident...
Look at the scene of the crime. Go on in.
You...  ...fell into the Bay.
No...
Because I love it so. It's beautiful there. Especially at sunset.  Ah... thank you for the fire.
I shall call you Mr. Ferguson.
...Falling... into San Francisco Bay?
What?
We have.
Shopping?
Well... anywhere in particular?
How can you be sure?
Oh... some, two thousand years, or more.
Of all the people who have been born... and have died... while the trees went on living.
Here with you.
Long ago...
Why did you jump?
Of the woman in the mirror. Would you know her if you saw her?
It's all there. It's no dream.
Yes.
Please let me go.
Yes.
Oh, yes!
I saw her come in five minutes. ago.
Well, you know those police department doctors: no sense of style.  Ah, tomorrow!
What's tomorrow?
You sound so disapproving, Midge.
Why?
I know. I have Acrophobia. What a disease. A fear of heights. And what a moment to find out I had it.
Three whole weeks.
Could be.
I just thought if I gave you a drink and fed you some dinner, you'd be so grateful you'd take me to a movie.
Naturally.
What is it, a still life?
First of all...
The hell I don't.
What are you fucking talking about?
Over eight years of some of the hardest raging experiences of my life.
What?
What are you doing?
Sure, why not.
It's a marble floor, we can clean it up.
Have you ever done this before?
She's Asian. They don't have Jews in Asia.
That is absolutely not true.
They're driving me nuts!
They're screaming for Starbursts.
It has to be done.
Don't sweet lip me.
I'm just gonna let her know I'm here.
That's the whole point. They rarely work out. But on occasion they do. And when they do, they do big.
We can take her out to Red Rock. Find some quiet place...and put her in the ground.
However it goes, the point is, nobody says anything to anyone ever. Right? ...Right?
What?
What you just said. Say it again.
I just want to get married.
What are you going to do?
You care to add a little specification to that slanderous accusation?
Okay fine.
Not a prayer.
I'm a lifesaver. A lighthouse. Up all night in the rain, in stormy gale force wind, tornado and fucking earthquakes. I stay lit for you. I stay lit. I don't go dark. I never go dark!
False.
You will not screw this up.
Yup.
What else have you forgot?
Don't you put this on me. Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it, don't...
He's a moron.
What does Moore have to do with your growing?
I've known him since Cub Scouts.
He's weird.
I'm not going to marry you with the smell of prostitutes on my body.
Of course.
Go down where?
Honey I don't have the time...
Maybe.
That's sweet.
Hey. It's me.
How late?
I need you to pick up the cake tomorrow.
Oh God. We. Liz. We. We. Killed a woman. We...
Call the police.
What money?
I don't know. He could have told someone. He could have, like in the event of his death, somehow let someone know where those bodies are buried.
Move the bodies.
No...
It means she's insecure.
Yup.
The stone age.
We will.
I KILLED MY BROTHER!
Are there many windows?
Smoking makes me feel ill? It's these filthy fag ends. I won't mention in this company what's upsetting you.
You have no feelings toward ...
I know, Uncle, you've told me that already.
You must be out of your mind. I've been so happy these last few days -- now you've spoiled it all.
Enedina's going to take a picture. So we'll have a souvenir.
Fifteen yards.
No, sir, it's nearly six o'clock.  Okay, let's get a move on!  When are you leaving?
Thank you; but it's missing something.
But why? Why?
That's life. Some people are brought together, others are separated. What can we do, if that's the way it happens?
Kill him and I'll tell you. If I don't keep my word, you can kill me too. There are thousands of pesetas. Kill him, idiot!
I'm not sure yet. I've had a shock recently, and I'm only beginning to get over it. Perhaps I'll go back to the convent one day.
She's left.
And let him get run over by somebody else?
Right, I won't say that, but I still think they're no use.
A black bull came.
He couldn't get through the door, then?
You little liar! Get out of here!
Don Jaime loved to watch me skip.
They shut all right now. And the blankets are ready.
I've just had a letter from your uncle. He won't be able to come when you take your vows.
Ah! Pleased to meet you.
Hello.
Could I trouble you for my glass of milk?
I accidently triggered a protection mechanism which erased the entire program.
Whatever.
He would slaughter eight people sitting in a room, but not two prison guards?
You were supposed to act as if everything was real.
Until we know what new influences are affecting him, we can't be sure.
What did you find out?
If I were you, I'd get every demolition team in the city searching in and around the Biltmore Hotel.
I'm still making adjustments...
It's better than real. It's synthetic flesh. Synthetic blood. Synthetic organs...  It's a physiological machine.
As far as the public is concerned, it is. The reason you got fired, and I got my second demo into production, is I'm a lot smarter than you. I never give my best stuff away.
It was me, what?
My God...
I had something a little different in mind.  Instead of just playing Peeping Tom with Reilly, why don't you get him to show you what he's been working on after hours?
A little less than yesterday.
John died.
I've been in prison, remember?
The government must have figured there was no better person to create a psycho than a psycho.
In order to find him, we have to understand what makes him tick...
How did you get your hand out?
Sounds to me like a well—educated way of saying you have no idea what to do next.
Dammit, I hate sounding so clinical all the time. All I meant to say was I thought you were doing well, but then I...
You know I am.
They're going to fry me for it, anyway.
I don't know.
Who else do you know who touches the world with synthetic hands?
GRIMES, YOU'RE DEAD!
My...secret.
As long as they keep overpaying me, I'll keep overpaying you.  ) Just make goddam sure you can have 10 of them ready for deployment around the city by next month.
...on the way in.
It's the White House.
You know what?  This is good.  This is terrific, and I'll tell you why:  it's <u>cost effective</u>.  This is....
...but the President wonders about the Possible Albanian Backlash...
What can it hurt.
What can it hurt is they offend me.
Gonna be fine.  Gonna be fine, people?  Are we getting there...?
Izzat the thing...
Wilfred, that's not bad.
Much more...uh, he have much more time to "serve?"
He's not fine.
Come on.
<u>Fuck</u> the world.  Try a ten A.M. <u>pitch</u> meeting, no sleep, coked-to-the-gills, and you haven't even read the <u>material</u>.
Okay.  And she's alleging...?
They caught him in the closet with a Girlscout.  Side- effects of a pill ain't gone trump that.  You have to keep'em guessing for  Two weeks.  You  don't have to Cure Cancer, Pal, you just have to give them something more interesting than...
Okay, look, who's takin' the press conference today?
<u>Do</u> it...
....we landing?
Who's gonna tell'em.
In the yellow ribbon.
...what's the Long View?
Your guy gets four more years in Washington...  ...it's only Nine More Days.
Big Bird touches down <u>when</u>?
Anything at the Airport?
<u>So</u> forth...
Knock on wood.
How long you been up, you need a nap.
You're tired, Ronnie.
Brazen it through?  Brazen it <u>through</u>?  They're going to hang us out to dry like the <u>laundry</u> --- do you know what we've <u>ddd</u>...
Uh...Didn't we <u>do</u> this?
All Combat takes place at night, in the Rain, and at the Junction of four Map Segments...
...what are we going to do...?
Hello?   No, operator...
I'd like to mention a few <u>names</u>, who...
WHERE'S MY FUCKING <u>PIIIILLLLLLL</u>...?
The President is going to declare War against Albania in a half an hour.
Yeah, I need a list, people in Military Special Pro...
I'm <u>doing</u> my job, Mr. Brean.  That's what you see me doing here.  What <u>is</u> it you thought <u>you</u> were doing?
There was a group of Girlscouts here from Indiana last month.  One of them expressed an interest in a Frederick Remington bust.  The president took her into the oval Office, for a period...
...you the Press Office?
...Yes.
Dartmouth
We have some mutual friends in Washington.
I'm here, Mr. Moss, because you've shown yourself a great supporter of the Party.
Yeah, hut you can't hold the dam.  How the hell, n'nu'n', I don't get what you want <u>me</u> to ...
Remember the Maine...
"They Got To Know?"  <u>Stan</u>...?  Get with it.  Who Killed Kennedy...?  I read the first draft of the Warren Report, said he was killed by a Drunk <u>Driver</u>.  You watched the Gulf War.  What did you see?  Day after day, the one "Smart Bomb" falling into a building. The <u>truth</u>, I was in the building when they <u>shot</u> that shot, they shot it in a studio, Falls Church Virginia, 1/10th scale model of a building.
I never won an Oscar.
Because.
"Back End" ... count on it.
I gotta protect the Canadian Horder,
Yeah...?
In the Folk Music Section.  We'll be in in...
Where is he now?
Oh, you're gonna love this:
Hell, yes, we're, we're on our way to get him now.  No. Lookit:  it's like a girl with her virginity, y'understand...
I got it in the inaugural.  "Thank you for voting for me, but, <u>as</u> importantly:  Thank you for <u>voting</u>... 
Getting off on the inaugural?  Gonna go...
...the Albanian Campaign.  This... this is history...
Cause I don't think <u>this</u> dog is gonna hunt....
No, I'm fine... I got it together....
No, the deal <u>isn't</u> changed.  The Deal <u>isn't</u> changed. You can't ... what is it?  Money?  <u>Money</u>?  You want Money?
Hold it a minute, Benny, we're going to tweak it a bit.  This may take a while.
See y'at the Finish Line.
Leopard Skin...
Thank God this is America.
No problem.  Here's the...
Albania, Albania, Albania, James bond Villains.
A beret.
Hey, <u>you're</u> getting the big bucks....  I think we're up-and-running...
Is it a <u>stream</u>, or is it a...
...not that you learned anything, Chunk.
Howard the Jerk reneged on me. I've got to cover his loss to the tune of about seven grand! I'm tapped out man, American Express got a hit man looking for me.
Hello, Natalie -- guess who? That's right, and you know everyday I say to myself, today could be the day... So what do you say... will you marry me? Then please can you get me through to Mr. Gekko?
Cindy. Having sex with her is like reading the Wall Street Journal 'cept the Journal don't talk back. 'Sides this AIDS crap is ruining romance, nobody trusts anybody anymore, gotta get a blood test in the toilet before you leave a bar together, somebody oughtta invent an AIDS dipstick, no kidding, make a fortune. I gotta get to work... Z's today. 
You know what you need, buddy buddy--an optorectomy. That's when they cut the nerve that runs from your brain to your rectum--to change that shitty attitude of yours.
Start unloading.
It's Queens, Dad and a 5% mortgage and you rent the top room--I gotta live in Manhattan to be a player, Dad. There's no nobility in poverty anymore, y'know. One day you're going to be proud of me, you'll see... 
Not in here Dad... please. Later.
Don't start, alright.
Whatever night you like.
I guess it's time to hit the road.
I got this guy who should know tells me buy Hewlitt Packard but I been burned on tips. What do you think Bud?
Let's see, it closed at uh, 41 1/8...  Up a quarter...very attractive... about average yield...
Can't complain. Got a house in Oyster Bay. Market treating you good? Still seeing that sexy French gal?
Come on Buddy, you wouldn't want to got me disbarred now would you?
Too much to do...but I'll walk you out.
All right, Bud... let's do it.
....Relax Roget  You're 82M in the account numbers and I'm the Invisible Man... they're always looking for red flags, Gekko's always getting checked by them, they never come up with anything... we're invulnerable on this...
Alright... I just wanna slow down Bud... no more calls for awhile, no lunches... we suspend our business, alright...
You're just the President of the company, what do you know? ... Come on.
So you say. Nice to meet you; hope you're intelligent. Like these, how'd you get these? 
So whatta you got for me, sport? Why are you here?
No sir, that would've been illegal...
I don't understand.
Allright. Wait here...
Destiny took us apart, but I knew it would bring us back together.
...few thousand dollars down the drain if you ask me.
You could have a great beach house for that.
I gather you're a decorator.
How would I know? I once bet a horse. He went out at ten to one and came in at quarter to five.
Yeah, almost...
Sure... But your fee... considering you're way over budget, should be negotiable.
You think I'm gonna broker the rest of my life... I'm going to be a giant, Darien, an entrepreneur in the Italian 15th century sense of the word -- a mover, shaker.
Fear. The fear of being poor I guess, just like you, Darien... But that's all gonna change sweetheart. I'm catching the express...  ... and you're going along for the ride.
At least I wouldn't be pulling the trigger.
Those days are over, Gordon. They were over a long time ago.
You and I are the same, Darien. We're smart enough not to buy into the oldest myth running: love... A fiction created by people who got nothing to keep them from jumping out of windows.
You're really twisted, Gordon. You're incapable of giving to anybody because deep down inside you there's a poverty that every last dollar in the world won't fill.
He's flowing, Gordo. Piece of cake.
I'll have a letter of agreement drawn up within two days.
If you mean what you say, I think we're in the ball park. I'll take it to my people.
Oh I don't give a shit the guy's a slob.  He doesn't even know how to spell  `lady' let alone treat me like one.  You know the last time we went out he  actually made me pay for a drink?
About what?  About us.
China.  What happened? CHINA Shhh.  It's ok.  I missed you so much.
Hmm.
Tony and China?
Like her?  I don't know if I ever liked her.  It's just you want what you can't get.
China
Safety in numbers man.
Hi there Sarah
Well, it's a long story.SIR WILFRED Oh good share.  I love them
Why?
That's not true.
What do you mean?
How do you know it's a she?
At the party.
Give me that shit.  Your wife.
I didn't kill my wife.
It's Mrs...It's Claire...Spencer.  From next door.  Is everything--
That's not...It's not like that.
For scaring you like I did.  When I thought about what that must have seemed like that day...
Thank you.
Um...sure.
It's like that.  Doesn't seem real.  No note.  Nothing.  Cops say she'll be back.  I just wanna know what happened.
...just so she could cut them off.
We both auditioned for the Philharmonic. One cello position open.
I met a dashing young grad student after a recital one night...
You are?
Yep.
I don't know.
It's alright.
No.  Jody, listen to me.  You have to listen to me.  This is not something that I can do right now.  Whatever it was, it's gone.  I need it to be gone now.
I've got to find a bathroom.  I'll call you.
Artsy little village down seven.  There's a guy there who sells my work.  I had just dropped off some paintings and as I got in my car...I saw Norman sitting at this little cafe.
That could take days.  I need to do something now.  Don't you see?  She wants us dead.
Like what?
Did he say that?
We did.
Claire...
Is it gone?
Did you tell her?
Norman, you are so funny about that.  No, I didn't.
Huh.
And that means he murdered his wife? This is getting ridic--
Who did?  Mrs. Feur?
Tonight?
We're going to be fine.
Who did?
Jody and I.  And she was there, Norman, she was.  It scared Jody so bad she had to leave.
How did you--
Good.  You sat in front...I saw you there...
A cheap wine glass from the caterers.  You started crying.  I tried to comfort you...
You shoved me away and ran out to the patio.  I took you home.
Not personally.
Yes.  The ghost.
Since when?
What did you think I would do?  Jesus Christ!  I gave up my life and my music...
Claire...
What?
You don't have to do that.
MADISON!
There is a difference between sensing danger - and being afraid.  what defines you in the landscape, Michael...?  what anchors your life...? Your work...?  Your creativity...?
"Go back, Michael.  Do what you can..."
Nothing was ever more false.
He chose ME for ROWAN --- when I was a child!
C'mon now - give a little nod to Mayfair tradition.
It's over a month.    The police say it happens all the time.
I'm not saying I believe it...but I heard it 'nough times to know somebody did.   They made a deal with the devil.  Y'know - "make us rich" - worship the number thirteen - the whole bit.  And some stuff about 'bringing them all back through a door...'
I wish to speak to Ellie Mayfair.
I had you sent away.
A Mayfair it ever I saw one.
I'm tired.  I need to rest.
Just like your mother - and all the others that felt him - and used his power - and went to hell with a smile!
I'll tell OR we're bringing -
To love, you must be able to feel.
What Michael gives me is stronger than anything you could ever inderstand.
I love Michael...
Only you...
Wrong...?  Science is not magic.
It was an accident.   Gifford, too.
Rowan...
I guess so.  The trick is remembering how to act like one.  I'm glad you called, Mr. Curry. I wanted to see you.  Why don't we go to my office...
Nothing.  Absolutely nothing-
Just sit there and soak up the vitamin D.
You stop it.  you're loving, and gentel..  You're the most remarkable woman I've ever met --- so stop telling me I don't know what I feel just cause you're scared.  Cause it won't work.
Hello..
Michael - this is Beatrice Mayfair. And this is her brother, Giff---
No, I'm ve-ry good --- and you aught to know.
So how come I love you most when you stick your finger in your chin...?
Dropped it.
Mm-hmmm...
It's not some fairytale in an old book.    Michael - look at me.  I didn't choose this, Michael.  This is who I am.  I love you.
I love you too.
That's not funny.
Michael - I'm sorry...  Just give me -
Yes it is...
I didn't say that - I'm sure it could be, but our clients must sign in first, checking signatures, and a photo ident - we had a nasty theft two years ago and we've been very strict since then.
No - the police say I've killed fourteen - but I've not - I've killed many more. It amazes me how they just haven't found the bodies. What is society coming to when people just don't get missed. I agree, some of them are well hidden - I probably couldn't even show you where I put them - one girl, number eight I think the press called it - she wasn't even mine - I don't know who did it but I didn't
Oh anywhere - whenever I needed to - Do you know how easy it is to take them? You just pick up a hiker, or someone off the streets - they believe so easily you know, 'Look, I have something to show you' I would say - and that would be it. One girl, I think her name is Debbie - she had broken down on the motorway, and I offered to take her to a service station to call for a tow truck - She just got in and I drove away. When I pulled into the layby and took out my knife - she just froze, and said - what do you want? - I said, You know what I want. - But she didn't. Getting rid of the bodies is just as easy - the first I cut up, put in bags with bricks in, and tossed them off Eldridge Bridge in broad daylight.  The real problem with my work is the blood - there is so much of it - and it all spurts out so fast - like a fountain. It made such a mess of
Didn't DEBBIE deserve anymore?
Why not? Please - it would help me
Wonderful - like a great release - He was a malignant cancer and I had to remove him - the world is better without him
Open it...
You want me to wear white for you? You must be madder than I thought...
But ELLEN, I told you I have stopped...
Out - I may be some time
No thanks - 
CRAP! - I wish I had taken a photo of your face when I gave some to that DETECTIVE - What's wrong ELLEN - you look pale - maybe you have been eating the wrong kind of foods lately - it could be food poisoning?
At 2.00...
Yes, sorry - He's here to make sure that you are alright
I defy any and all limits.
Nobody knows about your constant masturbation.
Beauty? No. We're talking GODDESS.
Then there must be a whole room, made completely of chocolate.
This is a fun place...but we don't usually come here until after the orgies.
Let me get this straight...
So that's a maybe?
You expect me to think at a time like this? There isn't a drop of blood in my brain.
Come on, I was hamburger. You were porterhouse.
We own a small family grocery store.
We love our lives just the way they are.
We miss you. We miss our son.
We want you to go to college, find a career you love, marry a nice girl from a nice family, and live happily ever after.
Think of it as a rite of passage to manhood.
Whatever helps you cope.
Dad, let's just say I can buy anything I want in the whole bookstore. Including the bookstore.
Well, good. Every little bit helps.
It's okay. You need me?
Watch your tone, mister.
But if you're watching this, then it means we bit the dust.
Are they hitting you up for donations? Asking you to sponsor the local quilting bee?
It's not up to me.
You want it in writing?
You ever look down on them again and call them "grocers" like it's a dirty word, and you'll be sucking your filet mignon through a straw for six to eight weeks. Got it?
I have absolutely no intention--
Ah ha! It was so well hidden, you didn't even know it was there.
That's not ENTIRELY true.
Could everybody else tell you were different, or were you the only one who knew?
I see. So more like a tight rope walker who secretly wants to be a trapeze artist.
Funny you should say "peachy."
Undoubtedly an aristocratic bartender of some sort.
I bet there are lots and lots of mirrors on Planet Ted.
You're implying she's, what, a gold digger?
He didn't. He had it built.
The ozone must be fully depleted on Planet Ted.
If we were a team, we could do anything. I mean, anything.
You forget, I dislike YOU at least as much as him.
He's on the move?
I'm trembling with excitement.
I have a bit of a goosebump fetish. Not many people know that.
Shoes, if you want to know the truth. Shoes are my thing.
I see.
You lose trust in someone and it's over, done, gone, forever.
Which explains the continued success of "Heaven" for how many decades?
Did you have a nice flight?  Are they taking good care of you?
You promise you'll finish school?
But how would we pay our bills?
Ted, you are the best editor this school paper ever had. You don't need to be pandering flesh. It's nonsense. It's beneath you.
You think I ought to just tell them thanks but no thanks? I don't want your silly billion dollar empire?
Rules are rules.
Come on, it's our only senior prom.
Huh! You laugh in the face of pressure!
You are a multi-media magnate. The Tycoon of Tits. The Baron of Bottoms.
Why, look who's here.
I would have been laughed right out of Xenia.
No one will be laughing at you now, Ted. You can take that to the bank.
It's really going to be strange going home in a couple of days.
You ARE home. But go ahead, finish school, do what you feel you need to do. In the meantime, I'll be your point person here on the magazine.
All is fair in "Heaven," Ted-baby.
The Van Ryan family created Blue Bay. They built the school... Sandra Van Ryan calls up the board and says kiss my ass, they say, left, right, or in the middle.  You're gonna need some help on this one, Sam.  You're gonna need a lawyer, and he'd better be a good one.
I'd like that.
I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions.
No.  I've done it a couple of times, I mean with guys I dated.  But this hurt... like, he was built... you know...
You mean he withdrew...
Try, Kelly.
Maybe she used another name.
Ray thinks she was murdered.
Yeah, well, Van Ryan got his.  I don't imagine he gives a shit now.
It's a shithole.  But she was dirty, what was I gonna do?
The job looks okay to us.  But look at it from his point of view.  The man's surrounded by wealth and privilege.  But for him... it's just a reminder of what should have been his.
Ray.  We don't know anything yet.  She could be anywhere...
Why is that?
We need to tape the interview, Suzie. No one will see it but us.  Now when was this, that Mr. Lombardo gave you the ride?
Just tell us what happened.
Bit, scratched.  But I had her pinned. She calmed down.  I was going to cuff her... She said she thought she was going to be sick.  She asked to use the bathroom.
Suzie!  Did this man rape you?
Okay!  He did.  He pushed me to the floor and he did it to me.  Now, can I go home?
No!
Yeah, sometimes.  Lots of the kids hang out here.  You really think something bad happened to Suzie?
Yeah, I've got family and they've got clout and now you have me.  Right?  And Sam.  Believe me, Suzie, this dickhead's not going to send you anywhere.  He's gonna try and rattle your cage, and that's it.  Stay strong and he can't do shit.
Curiosity, I guess.
You all gonna go down to the Caribbean together?
I've been a cop for a while, Kelly.  It's hard enough for one person to keep a secret, let alone three.  And then there's the love angle.  I mean do you and Sam really want that little pill-head around, now that you have the money?
Where, the mall?
Do it to ourselves?
Kelly... Relax.  Take one of your mom's valium or something.  In another week you get on the plane.  It's over.  We're rich.
No little girl can ever make me come.
Forget it.
I was just thinking about where I'm gonna stay.  I lost the house.  It's like waking up from a goddamn nightmare.
You'll get over it. We've got a knockdown, airtight, motherfucker of a lawsuit against Sandra Van Ryan.
Suzie Toller is dead.  You don't want Kelly to be next, then take my advice. Stay out of my way.
Well, you're half right.  Best thing you could do for yourself right now would be to talk to me.
You, Kelly, Sam.
And she wanted to talk.
It is and I don't.  Ordinarily...  But, I mean... there's this kid standing in front of you crying...
But then it is better this way, don't you think?  No loose ends.
Sorry, Sandy.  I've got plans.
Interesting.  Mine say the same thing, and they don't mention you, not even as a valet, although we could talk...
Wait a minute.  Now I know where I've heard of you.  You're the gadget guy.
No offense, but all I ever need...  Are these...  And this.
Yes.  Now, observe....
It's a repeating steam cannon!
That's right... That's good.
Nothing much to it really.  When I was younger I got into a pretty bad run-in with the Wyler Boys.  I saw them coming.  But I didn't act fast enough.  Second-guessed myself. And it cost me... cost me dearly.
I find most criminals slip up somewhere...
You really enjoy yourself, don't you?
Sounds like a train.  Looks like a train.
I don't have to tell you what that would do to our careers!
I'd love to stop him, but have you noticed the hundred armed men?
Well, hell, maybe we do have a chance.
That's... that's the criminal mind about to stomp our sorry butts!
Oh, I see, an easy plan!
He was going to shoot me!  Do you mind?!
All right, all right... It'll be okay.  I mean, eventually it'll just run out of steam.
Yes, me!
My Lord, he was telling the truth!
They don't even realize they should be frightened.
I get that feeling.  You know, Mr. Tyler, I'm the kind of woman who doesn't believe men are much more than a complete waste of time. But after spying you across the room, I'm tempted to suspend my disbelief, at least for the evening.
Well, I owe you one, don't I?
I'm not so sure Dr. Loveless would like to find his social secretary dancing in the dark with an uninvited stranger.
Thank you.  But the truth is, I'm a single woman in a man's world. That leaves me very few choices, doesn't it?
You bring the best out in a man.
Fine, I'll stop.
Well, yes sir.  A Professor Morton, but with just a little more time, sir, I can assure you a breakthrough on this case...
That'll be all, boys.
Nicely said, sir.
Thank you.  I confess to a preoccupation with acquiring precisely that which the world says I cannot have.
Has it penetrated that adrenaline- addled skull that you are surrounded by seventy-eight of my loyal followers?  You are in my domain!
Has it penetrated yours that I'm holding a gun on their leader?
Well, your highness, what makes you think we'll ever sign a treaty with you?
So, I'm the only one here who can tell the difference between an Emperor and a murderer?
He's just full of plans that aren't gonna work out.
It is?
They're rounding up a posse.  Figure an hour?
He thought you were a woman, Airk!
You managed alright.
Then come with us.
Thought you might get lonely, Mad- martigan!
She belongs to all of us.  She is the future queen and ruler of all kingdoms on earth.
He turned that monster into stone!
Are you okay?
Of course!  I promise!
These Pecks make terrible nurse- maids.
Elora Danan!
Want me to carry Elora?
Are you scared?
Kill him!
What's the magician's weapon?
His will.
Us??  We'll never catch them.  Any- way, we're all done, Teemo.  Let's go home.
Shut up.
Here.  Hold her.
Who??
How are we going to get out there?
Not one this big.
You've got a man here and the kids are upstairs?
It's been a while.
Pick up the hat.
Who'd you see?
Black... I understand. What else,Sam?
Listen to me, Sam! I want you to go across the new corn to Stoltzfus'. Run as fast as you can. And stay there!
I won't. Now run.  Fast as you can!
Oh, he's good.
Zenovitch was about to deliver a list of names tonight – street chemists... the guys processing this P2P into speed.
So one of them got to him.
Who else knows?
I've already got something worked out.  Be seeing you.
Move! Or you die right here!
Doesn't surprise me. I meet a lot of people like that.
Gunshot... they'll file reports... they'll find me.
I'm not so sure of anything as you are, John Book. You could live this life if you wanted to bad enough.  Just as I could live yours!
That's your way, not mine.
I hear you.
I wanted to. you were kind to take us in last night.  Anyway, I needed something to do. I was so angry with your brother. He's so... agaanisish!
I made it a contest... the one who does best gets his cereal back first.  Children like to help... they only need to be kept after a little bit.
God, Fred...
Eh? Well then, maybe he can go to Zook's barn-raising, eh? See how good a carpenter.
Eh? Nothing? Rachel, you bring this man to our house. With his gun of the hand. You bring fear to this house. Fear of English with guns coming after. You bring blood and whispers of more blood. Now English music... and you are dancing to English music! And you call this nothing?
That is idle talk.
You're Rachel Lapp, aren't you?
I know. Sleep now, Liebchen.
Fifty-seven, fifty-eight --
All right, Mrs. Gale.  But some day they're going to erect a statue to me in this town, and --
Yes, let the joyous news be spread.
This?
Oh, very good, but very mysterious.  He lives in the Emerald City, and that's a long journey from here. Did you bring your broomstick with you?
Professor Marvel never guesses -- he knows! Now, why are you running away?
Oh, you....
Oh, no, no, I have to get to her right....
No -- it feels wonderful.  I've held that axe up for ages.  Oh ---
Oh, dear. I don't know what I'd do if a whole swarm kept -- Oh! Oh! Oh, there's one on me!
Oh - I'll get it!
You've had plenty of time already!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my!
You're right -- I am a coward.
The nerve.
Yes.
Why, I'd thrash him from top to bottomamus!
Supposin' you met an elephant?
Lion, darling -- I knew you'd come!
Ohh!
Witch?  Huh!  I'm not afraid of a witch! I'm not afraid of anything --- except a lighted match.
Oh, I'll try!  Really, I will.
Yes.  Oh -- look --
Yes --- there.
Oh -- and I was so happy!  I thought I was on my way home!
Oh -- are you -- are you all right?
The slippers -- yes.....the slippers!
Here --   Come on.
Do -- do you think it'll be polite -- dropping in like this?
Dorothy! You can't sleep here! You can't sleep in the middle of a field!
Not nohow!
Now, now, don't fret.
Don't cry now.  We haven't got the oil-can with us and you've been squeaking enough as it is.
Yeah --
So who are you?
Count to twenty.  I’ll be there.
Since Oxford. I knew him when he had nothing but a brilliant mind and enough guts to conquer the world. He’s a man of great integrity.
Sacrifice the girl to take out the terrorist?
He’s not through yet. Renard doesn’t blow up five million dollars unless he knows there’s more coming in. He’s working for someone. Someone who wants to stop the pipeline.  And they hired the perfect killer. One with a vendetta against King...and you.
Your last chance. Give me the name.
Stripped of all your weaponry, you still threaten me?
Since the kidnapping. Why do you ask?
You’re not going to.
Not at that price. Time to surrender.
A little. Does it matter? After all, what’s the point of living if you can’t feel alive?  Isn’t that right, Elektra? Isn’t that your motto?
You can drop the act, it’s over.
Elektra, it’s not too late.  Eight million people needn’t die.
Bond, I’m a civilian. This is my place. Used to be the royal family’s, now it’s mine. I run my little business, I stay out of trouble...
Where?
Laurie, I'll have to ask you to come with me.
Yes.  I heard this morning.  Washington's asked me to attend the funeral as a matter of protocol.
Mm hmm.
I could stay and go.
In the immediate future we're on Mars.  I'm telling you goodbye. You're trying to convince me to cure your illness . . .
Memories of the future are just like any others.  I've tried not to dwell on the unpleasant ones . . .  You won't die of cancer, Laurie.  There won't be time for that.
I won't do that.
I couldn't let him interfere with my project.
We'd better hope so.  -- It's almost time.
Well, that was Adrian's idea.  I know he's the smartest man in the world and all that, but -- talk about publicity hounds . . .
Oh, yeah.  They gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the hell out.  No expense account.  No place to live.
Not at all.  You look very -- dashing.  Here, you pick one.
I'm an open target, Dan.  If you're with me --
What are you up to?
That Detroit shit?  I'm so worried.
It's because there's nothing to be afraid of anymore.  The world's about to end.  I feel like I could save it.
Long as we're on the subject of perverts . . .  I miss Rorschach.  Let's spring him.
Obvious pattern -- all ties in --
I don't think she's coming with us.
Don't know.  Nothing I can think of --  -- outside of a nuclear blast.
He's the one.  He's been the one all along.  Stalking us.
I don't know their real names!
You're not "protecting" anyone.  These people's lives may depend on the answers you give.  These are all former associates of Dr. Manhattan --
I'll take a raincheck, Laurie.
Laurie -- he's the most powerful man who's ever lived.  He's changed the world.
ALL RIGHT!  ALL RIGHT!!  -- How'd you find me?
What is this place?
Whether you thought this was for real or not, you jumped in and helped the waitress on instinct. That tells me something about your character.
If you find out what I want to know, and if I'm able to successfully use that information, you get to go back to your degenerate little life. If not, you take a bath.
Yeah, I sent you pictures. Here's what I'm thinking. If they take out the cameras and sensors, they could probably put a bomb in this thing. You drop it in the water in the Red Sea and three weeks later it's swimming up the Potomac.
Hey, one miracle at a time. They're on to me now, remember?
Somebody else makes those decisions, not guys like you and me. You've done your job, X, head back to Prague. I'll be landing in 90 minutes. This is my operation now.
Cut the crap, X, I saw you down there. You're a hero. Don't be afraid to join the good guys.
So you'll dredge the bottom again. You've done that before. The results were... uneven.
I've seen enough. Turn it off.
Slick graphics, huh? See these dudes? They're called "Anarchy 99", they're the bad guy bosses.
Do they have any special powers? The bosses always have special powers.
"Anarchy" 99"?
Like what?
Mind your business.
Did you guys used to date? That's it, right? He broke your heart and you're still soft on him. That's funny, it don't seem to fit with a tough broad like you.
Why are you still hanging around? Your business is finished, you should go home.
I don't know who you are or where you come from, but I don't like you. You ask too many questions.
That makes two of us then, sweetheart, because I ain't buying your bullshit either. You're not like them, I can see it in your eyes. So you tell me, who's bullshitting who?
What's that?
What do we owe our governments? Yours kidnapped you, mine abandoned me.
I was supposed to wait for the cop to kill you and then kill the cop. They'll believe me.  I've been lying for so long, one more time won't hurt.
I'd forgotten how exciting it is working together.
Oh come on, don't feel bad. You got played, so what? You're new at this. Did you think you could just stroll into this business one day and have all the angles figured out?
Been to any good diners lately?
He's a pretty good actor, though.
I'm talking about the sports cars that disappear off the docks in Genoa and wind up here. If you don't know about 'em, who does?
You wanna see my politics?
And here I thought "anarchy" was just something cool to put on a Tshirt.
I don't like him being here.
Well, I think that's perfectly understandable.
What's that?
If necessary.
What if they're naughty?
Were you now?
I've seen a lot of rings.
Senator?
You mutant bastards...
Let's just say, God works too slowly.
You're backstage at the encore of creation.
Deal.
How?
Actually, Magneto helped me put it together.
ALIVE.
Let's just say that I am out to make some radical changes.  Now come on Charles.  For old times sake, for your sake...  Leave him to me.
I know.
And what do you do when you wake up to that?
I feel a great swell of pity for the poor soul who comes to that school again looking for trouble.
And has he achieved...any special degree of eminence?
Yes, sir.
Bring me some surgical gauze, a little tape and some disinfectant.
Baack!
What?
Love me oodles and oodles?
Oh, darling -- I'll count the hours that you're away.
Mother's going to help me with the invitations.
I hope you like large weddings.
Goodbye, darling!
All right then!
Darling, you mustn't worry so.
That's my good boy.
It seems fine.
A week.  Ten days at most.
I'll have to think it over.  It's not so easy just to pick up and...
My father was a sick man.
I am a scientist...!  not a philosopher.
Fron kon steen!
No, it's pronounced Fron kon steen.
Well, they were wrong then, weren't they?
What?
Did you hear that strange music?
'How I Did It.'  Good title!
How?
Oh!  May I call you 'Master'?
All right... elevate me!
You mustn't take it so hard. Bucharest wasn't built in a day.
But don't you see...the brain of Hans Delbruck is inside this grotesque hulk -- pleading with us.  I've got to untie it.
You can say that again.
No, no!  That whole thing!
Act casual!
... and equalize the imbalance in his cerebrospinal fluid...
Poo -- tmmm anngh ma Ritz!
That's quite all right.  What is it, dear?
No, thanks!  I want to get right to sleep.
What is it?  Is something wrong, Doctor?
Let me come with you, Doctor, please!  I don't want to stay up here alone.
But who was playing it?
Oh!  Yes, Doctor.
I think you've done it, master.
Are you serious??
Good night!
Nor to Elizabeth.
We all have our feelings.  I know that I have mine.  And... I wouldn't want to hurt yours.
Well...  ... perhaps for a few minutes.
MMMMmmmmm!
His schwanzstucker.
Three minutes to go!
Igor -- the clock!  Hurry!
Do you have a reservation?
Eleven o'clock, My LorJ 42
Our friend Colonel Dumford will be  should be   at this minute approaching Pulleine. I think we'll eat here. I want to scout that mountain top and be back with an appetite in one hour. .
Sikali Horse, My Lord. Christians alL I know each one by name.
Well, my horses are feeding, as you may observe, Mr Coghill. It'll take a little while.
Right.  Bombardier, to me please.
