You're asking me out.  That's so cute. What's your name again?
Cameron.
Hi.
I looked for you back at the party, but you always seemed to be "occupied".
What crap?
Me.  This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.
Where've you been?
But
I was kidding. People actually live there?
Because they're bred to.  Their mothers liked guys like that, and their grandmothers before them. Their gene pool is rarely diluted.
I teach her French, get to know her, dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me.
Buttholus extremus.  But hey, you're making progress.
And he means that strictly in a non- prison-movie type of way.
Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night.
What 're you talking about?
Yeah
Two legs, nice rack...
You're gonna pay me to take out some girl?
I'm on it
You and Verona?
You didn't have a choice?  Where's Kat and what have you done with her?
Well, I guess we're not, since we don't have dates .
Come on -- the ponies, the flat beer, you with money in your eyes, me with my hand on your ass...
What's this?
I just need to lie down for awhile
This is so patronizing.
Who?
Hey man. . .  You don ' t think I can be "cool"?  You don't think I can be "laid back" like everyone else?
Maybe.
Unwelcome?  I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.
I guess I never told you I'm afraid of heights.
Then you screwed up
That ' s completely adorable!
Am I supposed to feel better? Like, right now?  Or do I have some time to think about it?
Hey there.  Tired of breathing?
Macbeth, right?
Right.
Kat a fan, too?
It was a bratwurst.  I was eating lunch.
Why don't we discuss your driving need to be a hemorrhoid?
In the microwave.
Your life, and that of others!
If God intended our proximity to Asia, do you believe he would have waited for you to show it to the world?
I know.
She said yes.
Beatrix, I want to ask you something.
May I ask by whom?
What does he say?
You have to find them, Utapan.  Look what they did!
The calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr, Esdras...
Two minutes... and already you're a dead man.  Don't let passion overwhelm you, Colon.
How old are you, Senor Colon?
Well... It's the men, Sir.  They wonder how you know our position. We've lost sight from land days ago...
And what do you think Mendez?
Well, I surely know what a quadrant is!  But I've never seen it used at night before.
Where can I meet this man?
He must be replaced.
Are you my attorney?  I'm Emil.  I'm insane.
Disappeared.  They're looking everywhere.  Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia.
Look, I haven't really focused on that kind of thing.
...so we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital...
...my little sister and I shared a flat - I came home one night and a man was raping her.  His gun was on the chair... He came at me and I shot him.
I still can't believe Eddie's gone.
No matter what happens...I'm glad I met you.
I'll make some for us.
I don't want to drag you down with me.
Look, after Jordy briefs me, you can do the press conference.  How about that? The case is all yours.
Did the D.A. videotape her deposition?
It was freaky, I'll tell you.  Stupid kid.
Yeah.
What's wrong?
Yeah.  He wanted a girl from Czechoslovakia, but I sent him Honey 'cause once they get there, you know, it doesn't really matter - Honey was killed...?  Poor girl...
What are you saying?
He said he was her cousin.  I told him where she works.  They were just here.
Tall, short-haired, scary eyes.  Second guy with him was...shorter, with a wrestler's build.  And he wouldn't turn his videocamera off me.
Eastern Europe.  Like what?  Romania? Hungary?
You got any better ideas?
Why not?
Look, Eddie, I'm tellin' you - I didn't touch her.
What's your accomplishment.
Detective, does it look like a murder?
Is it drug related?
Alright.
Alright?
You didn't have to embarrass me in front of my colleagues.  You could give me something.
Oh my G-d, they want me to anchor.  They want me to anchor tonight!
Yeah, yeah.  Good thing.
I hope this prick doesn't run.  My knees are killing me.  Stay behind me.
Let her go!  Let her go!!
Where is escort service?
I like to talk to the person who runs the service.  Can you give me address?
How much money are you carrying with you?
How long are you planning to stay?
Did you hear what I said?
Don't speak Russian!
What?
Whatever we do - we fuck her, right?
What is it?
I did.
And the whore's murder?  You didn't erase that either, did you?  Don't lie, I won't be angry.
I told you to cut that out before we handed in the tape!
Credit?
You got that?
A job??  As a plumber???  You think I come to America to work!
I know.
Yes...he's my friend.
That's what it looks like to me.
Nah, not at all.  Detective Flemming - Bobby Korfin.  My Uncle Tony worked with you at 2-1 back when you were a rookie.
Yeah?
Capra?  That's not Czech or Russian. Who said he sounded Russian?
It's about my salary cheques.
It's possible.
I know. It would be almost inconceivable.
Two more.
Hal?
You probably also know that we found them okay.
Well, don't worry about it.
I suppose it's because you've been under a lot of stress, but have you forgotten that they're not supposed to be revived for another three months.
I'm goin to do this myself, Hal. Let me have the control, please.
Oh, thank you very much.
Berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning Mars flight.
Oh, she's growing up very fast. As a matter of fact, she's six tomorrow.
Well, thank you very much for being so understanding.
I suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking.
Oh, I really don't have time for a drink. If it's all right I'll just sit for a minute and then I've got to be off.
Yes, it does. The sub-surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago.
Hal, have pod arms secure the component.
Hal, maintain normal E.V.A. condition.
I'm candy...
Yeah, i been waiting three years.
You just quit bein' a priest or somethin'?
Hey, don't do that.  I said I wasn't a pro, remember?
How about it?
I hear you've got visitors.
Yeah.  Sure, i'm crazy in love with him, who wouldn't be...
I don't need to hear your jive. I already got that department taken care of...
Luther was part of the gang?
Just up the street, the other side, over there ... Now, don't bother knockin' on the door. Luther ain't the kind of guy that looks for company.
Hey, this works pretty good.
Yeah, well, my ass bleeds for you. And I didn't get you out so you could go on a Goddamn "trim" hunt... stop moaning.
We eat when I say we eat.
You really do have onoe, huh, Jack... what's her problem besides you?
If we come outta this joint with Ganz' phone number, or a dead Indian, or anything else useful, then you could turn the other way for half an hour while I get laid...
I wasn't sure the money was still there until we saw Luther. You almost got your ass shot off for nothing once, not twice, Jack.
What?
Doesn't it get... Tiring?
Be polite. Say hello.  This is Candy.
What if your girl's theory turns out to be bullshit?  I mean, they could be in Rio de Janeiro.
Wait a minute, Cates.  I've been waitin' three years for that.  I don't think it's fair, man. What about the merit system.? You were gonnna give me a few thousand.
Jack?
I lost them, that's what happened.
Which one pulled the trigger?
Wait a minute, wait a minute... who's this?
Nothing came in for me yet?  No calls?
Then I sit back and I think, I mean, who's to say I'm not a dumb bitch.  I work in a bar, right? I can't read a list of my academic credentials to every booze-hound that comes in the place... You are what you do...
Bullshit?  I'll tell you about bullshit.  My gun's a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it.  It isn't my macho bullshit that's killing people, my gun is ...
Look, Jack, if you make everything your personal responsibility, you'll turn into a bad cop.  It's not a practical way to function...
Just one.  Some lady called.  Said she's a little hot-headed sometimes... But she still wants her occasional roommate. She'd like to talk it over after she gets off work tonight... if it's humanly possible....
Elaine, I gotta put you on hold...
How hot are they?
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
Instead of worryin' about Reggie, you better worry about me...
How about some ammo?
...Why on earth do the stones interest you?
No thank you.
She's not my bride, she's my fare. She's looking for this Vito Cornelius. According to the phone guide he lives here.
She's fine, really..don't you worry.. just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip.
Excuse me! Just one thing!  She said something to me a while ago and... I don't really get it... Akta Gamat?
What kind of mission?
What are you doing?
Yes, of course, but... The Stones are shut! They have to be open for it to work.
Imagine for a moment that this. thing is not anything that can be identified because it prefers not to be, because it is the antithesis of all we are. Because it is evil.. TOTAL EVIL.
Your theory is interesting Father but I don't think we have time to go into it right now!
Is there anything that can stop it?
Father.  You sure she's the Supreme Being?
Do you love her?
I don't have time... I need to know.
I was talking to the cat.
I don't need one.
Finger..man..I'm sorry..listen..I was on the way over but I had a fare fall into my lap.. y'know one of those big fares you just can't resist..
Hey,  that's... cute... Do you have a nickname, something a little... shorter?
You just won a trip, you dolt! Ten days in Fhloston Paradise for two!
Ma. If I'd won, I'd know about it. Someone would have notified me.
Hello?
He's on vacation.
Cornelius..
Love...
Finished what?
Here we go again...
And you can't concentrate with me around?.
Leeloo? The Stones! We have to open them! How does it work?
Isn't that a Z140? Alleviated titanium. Neuro charged assault model?
It's not?
Have you identified it?
Mr. President, let me introduce you to Professor Mactilburgh, who runs the center.
They just landed in the desert.
My philosophy Mr. President is shoot first ask questions later. I don't like uninvited guests.
Staedert?  What's going on?  Did you destroy it?
Lord forgive me.. they already know too, much..
"..in which all the history of the Universe resides ..all the strength..all the hope..Protect us from Evil.."
Drink!
Dispatch me another ZFX200 immediately. Someone stole mine.
Got it.
Sure.  I'll call the guy.
No, I don't, because you're not telling me anything!
What?
What you see is what I got, mister.
You know where I can get it?  I have a lot of money to spend.
Friend of yours?
Look, he's got nothing to do with this... let him go...
Why don't they come to me?
They were pretty clear they didn't want this coming back on them.
You're gonna be seeing a lot of me. You're sure you don't mind?
Eddie.
Yeah.
I had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month.  Do you know how bad a skin flick has to be for some jackass to come back into my place with a fucking receipt, and try to fucking return it?
You almost went over your limit.
Once you pick it up you can't put it down.
There's not much illegal.
From Pennsylvania.  P.I. from PA. What are you doing out here?
Sounds good, pops.
You've got Penthouse, Playboy, Hustler, etc.  Nobody even considers them pornography anymore.  Then, there's mainstream hardcore.  Triple X.  The difference is penetration. That's hardcore.  That whole industry's up in the valley. Writers, directors, porn stars. They're celebrities, or they think they are.  They pump out 150 videos a week.  A week.  They've even got a porno Academy Awards.  America loves pornography.  Anybody tells you they never use pornography, they're lying.  Somebody's buying those videos.  Somebody's out there spending 900 million dollars a year on phone sex.  Know what else?  It's only gonna get worse.  More and more you'll see perverse hardcore coming into the mainstream, because that's evolution.  Desensitization.  Oh my God, Elvis Presley's wiggling his hips, how offensive!  Nowadays, Mtv's showing girls dancing around in thong bikinis with their asses hanging out.  Know what I mean?  For the porn-addict, big tits aren't big enough after a while.  They have to be the biggest tits ever.  Some porn chicks are putting in breast implants bigger than your head, literally.  Soon, Playboy is gonna be Penthouse, Penthouse'll be Hustler, Hustler'll be hardcore, and hardcore films'll be medical films. People'll be jerking off to women laying around with open wounds. There's nowhere else for it to go.
Child pornography.
I don't know, where are yours?
Out of the back of bondage magazines mostly, but you can find it on the street if you look.  He'll also do commissions, for enough money...
He cuts all kinds of other stuff into his movies; photographs, newsreel footage, subliminal images. Thinks he's making art.
You hired someone to open it.  I'll bet the lawyer loved that.
I'm afraid I don't...
You... you need to go to the police.
Nothing remotely like this.
You're joking.
I don't know if luck's the word. Are you feeling alright?
I've been ordered into bed.  The doctor says I've gotten the flu, or some other wretched ailment.
I didn't think there were private detectives anymore, except on TV.
She didn't seem herself.  For months there never was any way to get her to talk about it.  One night we went to bed... the next morning she was gone.  She took some clothes.
Why do you think he did it?
Are you religious?
No.
I remember.  You just left...
Who is this... ?
They brought her into the room... one man, he put a knife to her throat and he raped her...
What is this?
None too discreet, is he?
No, sir, he is not.
Don't you think it kind of defeats the purpose?
Rick...I can't.
You in a hurry?
You're his sister, right?
Rick, please.
She told us the story of Freddy.  It's a town legend.  He was a child killer who was freed on a technicality.
Avoid-all-contact-day.
What is it?
Now you know who and what Freddy really is.
You just stay put.  You need rest.
You don't get it, he's after me...
I'm sorry your boyfriend got killed.
Hi, you don't look very well.  Are you feeling all right?
No you're not.  You don't even care about being a mom.  How come you don't think about me?
Who says I don't like you?
Where is he?
But Dad --
Good to see you again, Mr. Grey.  I've got to go find Dan.
There aren't any little boys on your floor.
You had me scared on the phone.  What's wrong with the baby?
I've got to write some of this down.
Where are you going?
But I've seen her grave.
Oh man!  I could've gone all night without looking at that.
Naah, I'm done.  Got to be on shift in a couple hours.  Aren't you going in?
Mark...
You could train someone else.
What is it?
My father!  He's not - ?
You're really a mixed-up oddball, aren't you?
I wouldn't worry.  So long as we have boats like the Tiger Shark - and people like you, the Skipper, Dave, Kent, Sir Ian and my father -
But Julie's a nice girl, and I've seen you work.  She deserves a fighting chance!
So they caught up with you, too?
<u>That's</u> the worst possible moment?
Course and speed?
What course, Skipper?
The frogmen?
Excuse me, Skipper---
The inertial navigation system. Must have been knocked out in the crash.
There's got to be an explanation!
You're sure it's Cyclops?
Just musing about our 'one-eyed adversary' and the legend of Homer.  'Cyclopes' were the Sons of Heaven, who forged the thunder- bolts thrown by Zeus.
Well, you look... sad. Upset. I don't mean to pry. I'm sorry about your mother. It was a nice funeral.
Alma, I think there's some dirty business going on in this town.
About Jack? No. Have you checked out the tax bill on your father's farm lately?
Has anybody offered to buy it?
You might be better off legally as well as financially to just go for the --
You can't buy Wade off.
It's not enough snow, not for tracking the bastards. No advantage there, kid.
Where'd Twombley get shot?
I never seen a man shot before. Not even in the service. Must be something.
Sure you did.
You musta seen him get shot. I know you did.
There's your old twenty-gauge, and that there's the new Browning you was showing me last night. This must be Twombley's gun. Brand new. Very fancy tooling. Probably fired one time. It's a beautiful piece of work.  But what the hell, Jack, I guess you deserve it. Right's right.
Why don't you quit now, you want out so bad?
Yeah. It's stupid.
What then?
It's stupid.
She won't be here for a half hour. Think you can stand it that long?
Sit right there by yourself if you want. Wait for her by yourself. That's fine with me. Just dandy. I'm going downstairs.
Pop?
Nothing, Wade, I've been thinking. You don't get enough appreciation around here and it's time we changed things a little.
You? Why?
It's just...
Low as what? What have I done? It's bad to want to see your own daughter?
Don't worry. I can protect my virtue. I mean, c'mon, Wade, give me a break.
About you and Jill and needing a third person. She went back to Lillian?
I heard he was drunk at Toby's last night and got in a fight with Hettie. He drove off without her...
No. Not for money. But, if somebody'd given me half a damned excuse -- I was pretty fucked up, you know.
You knew me as a kid.
I heard you talking. You got fired this morning, didn't you?
This town sucks.
The fucker shot himself. Ker-bang! That's what it sounds like. Not on purpose. I assume accidental.
Nothing.
Everything you know is from me.
Wade?
Who?
It's too neat. Things ain't that neat. It makes me mad. That somebody can pay to kill somebody, his own father-in-law, and not be punished for it. Don't that piss you off?
It wasn't me. I wasn't there, but I heard about it. When I heard about it, it was about Elbourne.
I'm sure he's busy.
You're right and I'll tell you a secret.  I know exactly how you feel.
You're one of Stravanavitch's men.
Alice!
There they are!
It's cut.
Aw, man. You're torn up pretty bad out here, sir. Do you have any elevater control.
Sluggish... I think it's jammed too.
I hate to be pragmatic, but they'll sacrifice pawns before kings. It may take them some time to kill their way up to senior staff.
Iraqi's won't buy it. Either they're already in on this or they'll think we're spying.
Air Force One, please reduce speed to 250 knots.
Nine.
We checked the manifest. Everyone was accounted for.
How?
Avionics compartment! It's the only place. You better get Zedeck down there fast Unless, of course, you'd rather be a martyr than a savior.
Ms.  Mitchell.  So nice to finally meet you in person.
Jim...
Now since we've had very little luck getting Washington or Moscow to cooperate, I wondered if you would be so kind.
She isn't a part of this. This is between you and me.
This administration does not negotiate with terrorists.
Twenty minutes?
Madame Vice president. We have an options paper.  chandler takes the options paper, waves off Lee, and reads it as she talks.
Sir, we stay with the President.
Can't it wait?
Don't.  I know spin control when I feel it.
What are you doing?
The fax machines.
Someone should give you a raise.
and if that means negotiating...
White House switchboard. How may I direct your call.
Other way around, sir.
Shepherd.
How long's it been since you flew, sir?
You handle your front office people, I'll handle the press and leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys downtown to the boys on the board.
Felt like a large asteroid.
What is it, Mary?
Elaine, what happened to us?
His name's David Stockman.  He's been here twenty years, that's all he says.
Ted!
Kurtz was the one who got us into this mess in the first place.  You people knew this ship wasn't ready to fly.  You played God with over a hundred lives, Kruger, and for what -- the prestige of your precious space program.
That's right -- premature ejection.
Are you afraid?
I mean for Ted.
I'm so excited, Simon.
That doesn't make sense.  Repeat analysis.
That's not possible.
I bet Scraps is going to love Mercury.
Do you think things will be a lot different on Mercury, Dad?
Sure.
We've spent everything on these operations.  Is it really worth it?  We've pawned your mother's wedding ring.  The kids have no winter clothes...
All right.  Here.
Captain, the coffee machine is jammed and I don't like it.
Let's go, Daddy.  We have to check in.  He was never appreciated at the Institute.
Ah, yes, the Institute, I'm familiar with it.
Do you have an appointment, sir?
You'll have to be more specific than that, sir.
No.  I mean your relationship.
We were in love but I'm not sure I know what love is anymore.
Ah, won't you sit down?
Hello, I'm Paul Carey from the airline. I'm here to pick up Captain Kramer.
Shep, sit...sit! So, I understand you've got a real emergency down there.
Both pilots!
A hospital? What is it?
Just how serious is it, doctor?
You know I haven't been able to get near an airplane since the war. And even if I could, they wouldn't hire me because of my war record.
Your <u>war</u> <u>record</u>? You're the only one keeping that alive. For everyone else it's ancient history.
He's all over the place! Nine hundred feet up to thirteen hundred feet! What an asshole!
Wait a minute. I know you. You're Kareem Abdul Jabbar. You play basketball for the Los Angeles Lakers!
I'm an airline pilot.  Ah, Clarence, according to my calculations, with this tailwind we ought to be able to make up an additional fifteen minutes over the Rockies.
I'm Randy.
The cockpit? What is it?
Does that cost extra or you throw them in?
I'm Sergeant Sykes, and this is Detective Jetson, Los Angeles Police Department.
He didn't recognize me.
When we picked him up, he was talking to those two cops -- the two who came to question you about Hubley.
Let's talk Hubley.
What is wrong?
Newcomers working near methane gasses at oil refineries must paint it on their boots to protect against sparks.
So the Slag they're cutting into upstairs worked at a refinery just like Hubley worked at a refinery.  I'd say that "possible" connection between the two cases just got a hell of a lot more possible.  Okay, next step -- I gotta go talk to the wife of the Slag store owner blown away last night.
Your mother mates out of season.
She's going to divorce me.
George, she's not gonna divorce you. You mate for life, remember?
It's all right, George.  It's cool. Just wait here, all right?  I'll be back in a coupla minutes.
Like your cocaine, I suppose.  The "high" lasts several hours.  We would receive small amounts of it... as a reward for our labor.
George... look me in the eye... George, you don't ever lie to me again.
What is this?!
... It's Harcourt.
Yeah... I seen him around.  High- roller dude named Strader.  Joshua Strader.  Runs a club on the west side.  Encounters.
Yeah, I heard of it.
You know I've been over all this with Fedorchuk and Alterez this morning...
Oh, here's an extra headshot if you need one.  We're just about to start cutting in.  You're welcome to stick around if you want.  It's really fascinating stuff.
Of course.  Right in the trunk of the car.
That is the question of the hour.  We could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization. An ant of termite colony, for example, is ruled by a single female, a queen, which is the source of new eggs.
It's going to be closer.  You better get going.
Have they located my daughter yet?
Is she...?
What about you?  What's your interest in this?
But they will know about it, Burke. From me.  Just like they'll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fifty-seven colonists here --
Well you're not reading it right!
Look, you started this.  Now show me everything.  I can handle myself.
Locked.
Hey, Vasquez...you ever been mistaken for a man?
Oh, man.  And I was gettin' short, too!  Four more weeks and out. Now I'm gonna buy it on this fuckin' rock.  It ain't half fair, man!
They cut the power.
This signal's weird...must be some interference or something. There's movement all over the place...
So what do I tell this guy?
Don't go!  Please.
The analysis team which went over your shuttle centimeter by centimeter found no physical evidence of the creature you describe...
Then that would be eating and drinking I'd live like a Prince without thinking. The wisdom of old would be mine - A woman's much better than wine! Then that would be eating and drinking! The wisdom of old would be mine - A woman's much better than wine. She's much better than wine! She's much better than wine!
Follow me, please. The Archbishop would like a word.
Indeed.
Is there a part for me?
No.
Extremely clever.
No! I won't have him back.
Oh, sir, he's never disobeyed me in anything. Please, Your Grace, give him one more chance.
Why what, sir?
Dinner? How dare you? I am a nobleman. I only dine with people of my own height.
Now?
Tish-I'm-tee.
Oh yes? You always know everything.
Yes!
No!
Well, ask her!
She won't talk to me. She says she has to speak to you.
We'll have a little party. Come in. Come in. You know Herr Schikaneder?  This is! a very nice girl.
Half the house! You'll never see a penny. I want it here, in my hand.
Stanzi-manzi, I'll put it in your hand!
What's that? Oh!  Who gave you this? How much is it? Wolfi, who gave you this?
I can't write it!
I see.
Thank you very much, Your Excellency.
Are you sure you can't leave that music, and come back again? I have other things you might like.
It is miraculous.
Come back tonight.
Well, thank you very much. You can go now.
How much will you pay him?
Not at all.
Money! Money!
I see that you're expecting.
He's adorable!
I am sorry, Madame. It is not permitted.
I am sorry, Madame, but I have my orders.
I was. But she quite outgrew the little I could show her.
May I try it?
Good morning, Court Composer. This is my niece, the Princess Elizabeth.
Oh, Your Majesty, it would be such a tremendous honour!
I have to tell you, Mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies.
Majesty!
Yes, where?
Yes, indeed.
And German?
I don't understand. There are just as many notes, Majesty, as are required. Neither more nor less.
My dear, young man, don't take it too hard. Your work is ingenious. It's quality work. And there are simply too many notes, that's all. Cut a few and it will be perfect.
Would you tell me why?
I agree, Majesty, but I'm afraid it's not possible. The young man is still in the pay of the Archbishop.
Yes, sir.
Your Majesty, Herr Mozart -
Don't you have a maid?
What's that?
Why not?
You don't have secrets from me.
Never mind. You won't have to do anything for me ever again. I'm leaving!
Why? What has happened?
I'm frightened, sir. Really! When he speaks, he doesn't make any sense. You know he said he saw - he said he saw his father. And his father's dead.
Opera? Opera!
What did he say? What did he say?
Yes, well, it's all good fun.
I'm serious. You write a proper part for me with a couple of catchy songs, I'll guarantee you'll have a triumph- de-luxe. Mind you, it'll have to be in German.
German!
What is this?
You won't be teaching this one either. She's my wife.
Love, Sire!
Did you like it, then?
Herr Mozart, what brings you here?
Why didn't you come to me yesterday, Mozart? This is a most painful situation. Yesterday I could have helped you. Today, I can't.
My dear Mozart, there is no one in the world I would rather help, but now it is too late.
Come, come, Mozart; I'm interested. Truly.
Why bother with Orsini-Rosenberg? He's obviously no friend of yours.
Did my work please you?
A man who deserved a Requiem Mass and never got one.
Where is your wife?
No, please.
Finish what?
Yes. Can I - could I help you, in any way?
Where did I stop?
What?
I think so.
Good. Now the tenors. Fourth beat of the first measure - C.  Con-fu-ta-tis.  Second measure, fourth beat on D.  Ma-le-dic-tis.  All right?
Oh no. I'm not tired at all.
Would you stay with me while I sleep a little?
What for?
What you think, Mozart, is scarcely the point. It is what His Majesty thinks that counts.
But surely the Emperor didn't mean to prohibit dancing when it's part of the story.
What is what?
Is the Emperor angry with me?
Naturally, the Italians! Of course! Always the Italians!
Mozart -
Mozart, music is not the issue here. No one doubts your talent. It is your judgment of literature that's in question. Even with the politics taken out, this thing would still remain a vulgar farce. Why waste your spirit on such rubbish?  Surely you can choose more elevated themes?
What do you want?
Of course. The man you accuse yourself of killing.
All Vienna has heard that.
It was incomprehensible. What was God up to? Here I was denying all my natural lust in order to deserve God's gift and there was Mozart indulging his in all directions - even though engaged to be married! - and no rebuke at all! Was it possible I was being tested? Was God expecting me to offer forgiveness in the face of every offense, no matter how painful? That was very possible. All the same, why him? Why use Mozart to teach me lessons in humility? My heart was filling up with such hatred for that little man. For the first time in my life I began to know really violent thoughts. I couldn't stop them.
Did you try?
Oh my son, my poor son!
I've just learned something that might be of interest to you, Herr Director.
You mean that play?
Well, the play makes a hero out of a valet. He outwits his noble master and exposes him as a lecher. Do you see the implications? This would be, in a grander situation, as if a Chamberlain were to expose an Emperor.
Well, promise then.
Yes, I am looking after him.
Can we come in?
Go about your duties.
You've absolutely no idea where David might be?
Dr. Hirsch?
Oh, I don't mean running about on all fours and howling at the moon. But in such a deranged state he could harm himself, or perhaps others.
The zoo? Is he rational?
I beg your pardon?
Call me Alex.
I was. What are you reading?
'A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court' by Mark Twain.
What do you dream about?
Now what do you want to talk about?
Was Jack Goodman your good friend?
My best friend. My very best friend.
That's easy enough.
Yeah. He says that I will become a monster in two days. What do you think?
There is only one bed.
David, you don't honestly believe that in reality your friend Jack rose from the grave to breakfast with you? Do you really?
I was awake and he was in my room.
Tell me that it's silly of me to be apprehensive.
Alex, I've lost my mind. I woke up at the zoo! But you know what? I feel terrific!
David, don't lose control.
How are we feeling tonight?
I think he's a Jew.
Now see here young man.
Mr. Bringsly, I'm sorry. I have absolutely no idea what to say to you.
What time is it?
It's nearly eight. I'm off duty shortly, then I'm off to the films with Alex.
London? Where's Jack? I had a strange dream.
Lunatic?
I've told you, it wasn't a man. It was an animal. A big wolf or something. A rabid dog.
I'm talking about a girl you want to fuck, so give me a break.
I have to make love to her. It's very simple. She has no choice really.
Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed wolf's head on a spear as their symbol?
A severed wolf's head on a pike as their symbol.
What about it?
Ask them what the candles are for.
I don't know. Let's see if there's an inn or something up the road.
Beware the moon?
What do you think was wrong?
Nice doggie. Good boy.
This is too much. I can't handle this.
David! You're hurting my feelings.
I can't stand it.
What?!
The wolf's bloodline must be severed. The last remaining werewolf must be destroyed.
You'll stalk the streets of London a creature of the night.
You must believe me.
You don't have to say anything.
Dr. Hirsch?
Hello, there. What can I get you?
What's that?
Oh.
I remember once when your account checked.
Not yet, Mr. Clark.
How are you protecting your depositors? By making a lot of idiotic loans!
What's the matter with my policy? How many losses has this bank taken in the last twenty-five years?  I'll tell you. Not a single one!  What's wrong with that kind of banking?
That sounds very simple, Dickson, but why should we jeopardize our personal fortunes?
Dickson, I'd like to talk to you about the bank.
Come out here you pawnbrokers - take a look at this!
I hope you don't mind me asking you a few questions, Mr. Cluett.
Claims he was there with a married woman. Doesn't want to mention her name.
I'm sorry, Dude, but—I—
Being alone with you has always done this to me. You know that.
Don't you know I've been crazy about you for years?
I'm not afraid of you. You haven't got a moustache!
Yes, sir.
The butler said I could stay. I told him it was important.
John, how's your wife this morning?
That makes it unanimous. I feel all right too.
If this isn't a red-letter day for Tom Dickson! First I trample on the Board of Directors, then I promote Matt here to assistant cashier, and now to complete the day I have a visit from my sweet and lovely and gorgeous wife. What a man, what a man!
It's amazing that your sweet, lovely, gorgeous wife can ever get to see you.
The theatre?
I don't know.
Helen, tell Matt I want to see him.
No, sir.
It's all right. Thanks.
Listen, Mr. Dickson, don't let them lick you just because a couple of big shots turned you down. You've got more friends than anybody in this town. Little guys - guys who wouldn't be in business if it weren't for you. All you've got to do is—
Why pick on him ?
They've been coming in steady all morning. I have called for some extra police.
How-do-you-do, Mrs. Dickson.
He's at a board meeting.
Come here.  You know, a few minutes ago I was in Cluett's office and Mrs. Dickson was there.
Oh Matt, you must be mistaken.
Shh . . . !  I'll wait for you upstairs.
He came to see Mr. Cluett.
He left here about an hour ago and went down to Dude Finlay's joint.
Dude Finlay?
How are you fixed?
That mug reminds me of a guy with his second dollar.
He's smiling.
Never thought that pissant town would look so pretty.
Here's Liberty's favorite son!  I'll never forget what you did, cousin.
Our place, Clell Miller's, Sammy Johnston, the Creeders. Will Hite.
We got a problem here, brother?
My plan of lying here pissing myself seems to be working mighty fine, thank you.
Damn!
You have no shame.
"The outlaws calling themselves the James-Younger Gang shot their way out of town, wounding the Sherriff and three other townsfolk."
You shut up now, boy.
Ride with me, cousin?
Sorry.
See, Frank's being smart about this.
A bad idea.
Bob, rip up some bandages.
We'll make them pay for this.
Well?
Strategically.
They gonna rush us?
The safe. Now.
Of St. Louis?
Ho-yah. Him say tell Big Lawman in Carville that badman Jesse James riding toward Rising Sun, above Great River, near Eagle Rock.
My little Web did that?
Every time I put my head up to hit that Gatling, they try to shoot it off.
Hello, Liberty Missoura!
Think about this. If we just come up with a story and stick to it, we should be all right.
You can shut up now.
Didn't think you would.  I'm going to go make the coffin.
I don't think it's counterfeit. Do you mind if I take a look at all your real bills to compare?
I can't quit and leave you alone. I can't quit until you quit. Ma would've wanted it that way.
They're all pinned down. Can't even get to the door.
A war against the railroad. What the hell were we thinking?
See you soon. Oh, and I appreciate the distraction back there.
Saved a lot of folk from the railroad.
Mostly. It would be an all right life, for a bachelor.
You planning on being a bachelor your whole life, Jesse James?
Sparkling rocks?
I would never have imagined us in a place like this.
I beg your pardon?
Aw, shucks, ma'am...
What?
Yes ma'am.
Oh. That's nice to know.  We're going to hang you, you know.
Was it worth it?
Should have just killed Thaddeus Rains and been done with it.
That's what I would have done.
I'm not hanged yet.
The railroad has no business in Tennessee. Therefore I have no interest in the state of Tennessee.
Discretion? Sir, I am a man of the cloth.
Thank you.
Right here in church?
I'm the same age you were when you went off to war.
This time we'll make an exception.
Lyla Devereux.
Really!
Leaving you in charge of operations until he recovers.
I see. I'll get together four patrols of our detectives for action tonight.
The final route for the railroad is complete.
Sir?
This is him.
You wouldn't have done that?
Would a jury around here convict their own? I think not. We're beginning an interesting game here, Mr. Rains.
Pinkerton. It's been eight months. I see robberies. I see hold ups. But I do not see men on the end of nooses.
No, you demand results. They are not the same thing. And if you want results, you will let me do my job as I see fit. Unless of course,  You want this fool to saddle up and take another run at it?
What is that?
Dorsia's nice.
A facial at Elizabeth Arden, which was really relaxing, then to the Pottery Bam where I bought this silver muffin dish. 
Champagne on the rocks. Oh-could I have that with a twist? She starts to sink back in her chair and Bateman leans over and pulls her back up.
I'm ignoring you.
It's a plain end. I think.
Oh Jesus. I'm going home.
It's a plain end, see? So?
See? Happy? You dumb bitch? Are you happy, you dumb bitch?
Isn't that special?  Patrick?
So, you're looking great, how have you been?
Yes, darling?
Your father practically owns the company. You can do anything you like, silly.
Well, you hate that job anyway. Why don't you just quit? You don't have to work.
Oh God, Patrick. Why Price? Price?
Everybody's rich.
He's good-looking.
He has a great body
We need to talk.
I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over. Us. This is no joke. I don't think we should see each other anymore.
How did you guess?
Ed Gein? Maitre d' at Canal Bar?
What exactly do you mean?
By the way Davis, how is Cynthia? You're still seeing her, right?
Now, if you'll excuse me, I really must...
That's a wonderful jacket. Let me guess, Valentino Couture?
No, Luis. It's not me. You're mistaken.
Van Patten looks puffy. Has he stopped working out?
Jeez. That's not a helluva lot, is it?
I said we are totally booked.
Patrick?
Let's not think about what I want. How about anywhere you want.
You don't need to lose any weight. You're kidding, right? You look great. Very fit.
You can always he thinner. Look...better.
So, what do you do?
You think I'm dumb, don't you?
Yeah, well, oh boy, listen, I've got to go. Thank you, uh... Victoria?
She's my...cousin.
Did you know that Whitney Houston's debut LP called simply Whitney Houston had four number-one singles on it? Did you know that, Christie? Whitney's voice leaps across so many boundaries and is so versatile-though she's mainly a jazz singer-that it's hard to take in the album on a first listening.
No, I'm sorry. I should've made an appointment.  Was that anything important?
I've been hired by Meredith Powell to investigate the disappearance of Paul Owen.
So it's nothing that official. I just have some basic questions. About Paul Owen. About yourself-
Oh no, I'm okay.
I think his family wants this kept quiet.
Shoot.
Where did you go to school?
What can you tell me about Paul Owen?
So...there's nothing you can tell me about Paul Owen?
Anything else you can tell me about Owen?
We were both seven in 1969.
Had his apartment been burglarized?
You'll have to excuse me. I have a lunch meeting with Cliff Huxtable at Four Seasons in twenty minutes.
Isn't the Four Seasons a little far uptown? I mean aren't you going to be late?
Absolutely, I'm 100% with you.
Detective Kendall...uh Campbell? KIMBALL Kimball.  Call me Don.
0h no. Informal conversations, mostly. What's that, Stoli?
Patrick, please. I hope I've been informative. Long day-a bit scattered.
According to his date book, and this was verified by his secretary, he had dinner with...Marcus Halberstam.
I'm so hungry.
Please...I don know what to do. I'm so cold.
Hello, Halberstam. Nice tie. How the hell are you?
We should've gone to Dorsia. I could've gotten us a table.
Yes, Owen?
No, Owen.
Is that a raincoat?
Is it over?
When I was a kid? And he was moving us all over the place? I spent all my time writing stuff on Outpost 1.0. I thought Gary Boyd was the greatest.
I forgot. That's why you have to help me decide.
No way. You have this -- destiny.
When's Brian coming for the TV?
I mean, if one little comment from Gary is gonna upset you this much --
What!
I can't just walk away!
You can't just walk in, either.
I know how to get in there. But you've gotta help me.
After I broke into 21 -- which was insane, thank God they didn't catch me! -- I just drove around. Trying to figure out what possessed me. You know what? I've been putting my own guilt on Gary.
Where were you?  You know you can't keep anything from me.
I know you think I'm too attached to him, but still. I am close to Gary. And you're the most meaningful person in my life.  I'm going back to the Comix place, why should I be killing myself.
Don't we have any chopsticks?
Right. Wait. A toast.
Not like him, is it? To do a thing like that without telling you. You're not losing your hold on him, are you?
Instead of busting my chops you should do something about that girl. Fire her. Or something.
Lisa's an extremely valuable member of the Skywire team. We've got our eyes on her. You keep yours on Milo.
Right... What's that mean again?
Yeah. Hi. Thank you for seeing me.
'Thought if I relocated it could help my case. I'm writing programs for the local public access station. Where any whack-job with 100 bucks gets his own show? God, does it suck.  Can you help me?
We tried!
Would you like a Coke or something?
You did this -- overnight?
Well -- you sent for me.
Talk about work? Never!
The wrong place?
Gary, hi.
Gary, don't worry, we --
Gary?
Could it be a glitch? Something the construction workers caused?
Delbert seems to enter #21 twice. Without leaving the first time.
Did I say something?
Graphical interfaces. For Skywire? I'm s'posed to coordinate with you.
Right. But Gary's tied-in to a lot of media conglomerates. Have to be careful who we pick.
What about "60 Minutes."
What?
I felt guilty. 'Cause I "owed so much" to Alice. But even then I was starting to wonder. Is it so great to be so consumed by this one thing that you let another person do your thinking for you? If you have a lucrative skill, it's all anybody wants from you. You grow older but you don't grow up. You turn into -- into --
Great. I knocked off the aglet, as soon as I get a passable version of Skywire we're there.
Yeah, that's old, in a tree.
Please don't go.
...He knows.
We rented a loft in Sunnyvale.  You know what's the bad part? We can't talk about work anymore. We're competitors! The venture capitalists made us sign like 100 confidentiality forms.
So -- how far are we from the campus?
Wait a second. I'm the one who found out he was mucking around in here in the first place.
I think it was Wordsworth who penned this little gem: 'Press the button, pull the chain, out comes a chocolate choo-choo train.'
Hello Austin. Hello Vanessa. This is Basil Exposition, from British Intelligence.  There's a company in Las Vegas called Virtucon that we think may be linked to Dr. Evil. Many of the Virtucon executives gamble at the hotel/casino where you'll be staying. That's the first place you should look.  Well, I'm off to the chat rooms.
Austin, Vanessa, let me bring you up to speed. Dr. Evil has high- jacked a nuclear warhead from Kreplachistan and is holding the world ransom for one-hundred billion dollars. If the world doesn't pay up in four days, he's threatening to destroy the world.
Carnies.
I'd say that about sums it up, Exposition.
Are you more satisfied now sexually, Austin?
Good on ya, man.
What's wrong with your hand?
Dr. Evil, do you really expect them to pay?
Well, as long as people are still having promiscuous sex with many anonymous partners without protection, while at the same time experimenting with mind-expanding drugs in a consequence-free environment, I'll be sound as a pound.
My mother's told me all about you.
My wedding tackle.
Do I make you horny?
A limousine has just pulled up.
Unfortunately, while you told that stupid story, Dr. Evil has escaped.
I haven't had fun like that since college.
Why?
Don't be sorry. You're right to be suspicious. I shagged her. I shagged her rotten.
I can't believe you made love to her just like that. Did you use protection?
Only sailors use condoms, man.
Yeah, I can't believe Liberace was gay. Women loved him, man. I didn't see that one coming.
No! Don't lay your hang-ups on me, Vanessa. You're being very trippy.
Does that make you horny?
I believe you, Austin. Let's go.
Are you crazy?
I'm going it alone this time, Vanessa. I have a follow-up visit with the Evil Doctor.
One credit card receipt for Swedish- made penis enlarger pump, signed Austin Powers.
Everything seems to be in order.
No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.
But my design was perfect!  Your autonomic functions were shut down, and even though your arm wasn't frozen, the aging was retarded, therefore your right arm is only slightly older than the left.
Remember when we froze your semen, you said that if it looked like you weren't coming back to try and make you a son so that a part of you would live forever?
What is it now?
Really? Are they ill-tempered?
Actually, the boy's quite astute. I am trying to kill him. My Evil Associates have cautioned against it, so here he is, unfortunately, alive.
Aren't you going to watch them? They'll get away!
Oh, hello Vanessa. How was the flight?
Normally, we'd be eager to oblige --
You don't say. How real does it feel?
I want you to say the first thing that comes into your head when I say these words. Do you understand ... ?  Blue ...
Secret ...
He said if it vanished, he'd know it was ... you who betrayed him. He took a huge risk. The ultimate test.
Would that I could say the Same.
I have an appointment.
This isn't a game.
To find out who killed my husband.
Good luck ... Peter ... Emma.
You killed my husband.
Such as?
Chaos. Transport paralysis. Crop failure.  Economic disaster. Frostbite or sunburn ... on a massive scale. You've seen a few samples...
Speaking of Peter, there's more good news: You won't even have to change your last name. You'll always be Mrs. Peel.
Doctor Peel, I presume?
... Showers followed by sunny periods.
Sir August Merryweather ... why are we seeing him first?
So ... I distract him while you snoop around? How?
You mean my other self ...
Elementary, Mrs. Peel. Trubshaw isn't the only shoemaker still practicing his trade ...
Any ideas?
Is that written in his shoe?
That's what we were working on.
... And by you, Mrs. Peel. Everything points to you.  No sisters?  No undiscovered twin?
Keeping a stiff upper lip?
But you did suspect me.
Not for a moment.
I'm playing to win.
Please don't tell me it's how you play the game.
You don't trust me?
Limpet bomb. Small, very compact. From Trubshaw's.
No bother. Mother and Father think I've joined you. I might as well.
Ah ... sun tan lotion. Any shops nearby?
Your mission is simple. Find out how and why these agents died.
Where's Mother?
Now let's see ... Eton, Cambridge ... research into robotics and plastics. Overtaken by Peter's work on the physics of climate change ...
Oh, hello ...
We want Mrs. Peel.
How did you guess?
She may not know. Theory goes she may be very ill.
Wonderland Weather Ltd.
Walk over to the window ...
Rules are made to be broken.
If you say so.
I'm totally blown away. You're getting married. It seems like only yesterday I showed you how to have oral sex.
What?
I've decided not to run for President.
Okay, ten thousand plus a G.E. toaster oven, a Litton microwave, a Cuisinart...
I don't want any trouble.
I know you're as unhappy as I am about Debbie's marriage to Rick.
Cole?
But a fabulous cook.
It's either meatloaf, Swiss steak or charred flesh. I won't know till it's finished.
You're going to have a bachelor party?
It looks awful.
Good...
Did I promise that? I don't remember that...
Okay, I promise... I swear on my mother's grave.
Have a good time. Don't make it too late.
I can't trust you!
C'mon, I knew it was you.
See? And these are not just ordinary party-goers -- there are professionals in this crowd -- I didn't want any of them. You... You're what I want. Understand?
A strange wang right in my palm.
Congratulations on your daughter's wedding. Who's she marrying?
What are you talking about, asshole?
That's it, prick lips.
Hookers beat you up?
Big problem now. Soon they go to customers.
I need them for a bachelor party at the Park View Hotel.
You are being in luck. Customers in same hotel. I let you have them at cut-rate price for 45 minutes.
Guys, I think I'd rather stay here.
It's on the tenth floor.
Keep your voices down. This is a respectable establishment. We don't go for any funny business here. Just then a GUY with a Moosehead Beer hat and TWO GUYS in a moose costume pass him and enter the elevator with the boys.
I'd love that.
Good. I think you're an asshole. No, let me correct that, an immature asshole. Which is fine, except you're marrying my daughter and I'm afraid my grandchildren are going to be little assholes.
Er... perhaps we ought to stop now.
The thought of that person marrying my daughter makes me want to upchuck.
Ed... you're kinky!
What the hell is that?
I got something you can't resist. I have a friend, Tracey. She wants to meet you. She loves to please.
If I'm not out in a half hour, send for the paramedics.
How'd it go?
Now, don't get into any trouble.
Hey, you guys...
What are you going to do about it?
What can I do? I'm dead. Debbie's going to go crazy and end the whole thing.
Rick, marriage will be good for you. It's done wonders for me.
Oh... it's... er... the guys from the beer convention. We're bringing them to the party.
Get going, Rick... you're late enough as it is.
Goddamn it, Stephen, lay off!  You stupid dumbshit, you never know when to fucking quit, do you? You ever wonder why your career's in the fucking toilet? Why you're gonna be stuck a Lt. for life?
My Lt. might have something to say about that.
Is he...
Not likely.
I like what you've done with the place.
My God, an actual operating 8-track.
People actually used to pay you for this?
I gotta do this, Stephen. I gotta know.
-- I told you to stay next to me!
C'mon ladies, let's roll some hose...
Dad's way? Where did he tell you that? In a fucking seance?
Just... Just wanted to say hello...
I saw it before it got them. I tried to yell, but... He asked me to look out for him. And I didn't do it. I let him die.
...Jesus, you been carrying that around for twenty years? For christ's sake, you were seven years old! You think he could have heard you in there?
I hate him so much sometimes, Stephen. You don't know how hard it was for me to put that uniform on...
I saw Adcox's back! I saw the burn! I put it there! Jesus Christ, Stephen, he's been killing people!
I know.
Anything else?
You crazy son of a bitch, why couldn't you stay behind a desk where you belong?
Brian.
You look great.
Uh... I've been sorta keeping a low profile... the academy... I graduated today.
Carrying Swayzak's notebook?
Yeah. Swayzak. Humanity's last hope. How can you work for that guy?
I've been thinking about what you said the other night... If the offer's still on the table, I'd like to talk about it.
Green committed to a thousand.  There's another fund-raising party tonight. Marty'd really like you to come.
You think that's really any of your business?
Do you miss it?  You seem like you do.
-- You could have scared the son of a bitch off. We may never bust him now. All for a couple's political points.
Oh yeah, he's the real fireman.  Who are you? Just another probie working for Swayzak --
Hi.
Who the fuck is doing this?
Uh, I'm Brian McCaffrey. Your new assistant.
Where are you going?
-- Shhh.
"Trychtichlorate is a binary structured --"
"During heat episodes of 2000 Kelvin or higher, Trych breaks down and dissipates. Will consume magnesium".
Why backdrafts. Whoever fried Seagrave and Cosgrove went to a helluva lot of trouble to make sure they died by fire, but also made sure the fire blew itself out.
No, we have a stone killer trying to make a point.
No.
So what do you want me to do?
Mr. McCaffrey...
Mr. McCaffrey... Keeping busy?
Engine 115, right?
Lots of fires. They promote faster there. Take a look at the last Lt.'s list, half the guys on it came from that battalion. Gotta think about your future, Timmy. 115's the station.
Y'know what Stephen said to me, right when all the shit was coming hard? "You never know till the moment the fire stares you down if you're just gonna do this job or be great at it".
Uh huh. And "Pioneer's Pride, Mobile Log Cabins". That was in your blood about six months wasn't it?
The great communicator.
Hey, I'm the first one to admit when I'm wrong.
See that patch of shirt? We wondered about the discoloration so he ran a spectro. On a lucky shot we picked up some traces of Trychticholorate. Nobody around here had ever heard of it.
Ronald here likes telephones. Used to tape wooden matches to the bell striker and wrap it in cotton. Came up with a whole little thing there, didn't you Ronald? When you got bored, what did you do? You just started making calls... mostly day care centers and retirement homes, wasn't it?
Got a cause?
I'm working on it.
Mr. Swayzak! How ya doin'?
It's horrible. They burned her breasts with cigarettes. Christ.
Who?
Yeah.
Who?
Are you all right, honey?
I forgive you.
All right, cop. I want my money.
Take your money? This guy will blow up your house and everyone in it!
What case?
Father, if it was so trivial, so natural, so -- No. I have sinned. And you must listen if you are to prescribe an appropriate act of contrition, and to absolve me. Father, what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your arms to serve God?
As I have prayed day and night since the desecration of this church yesterday morning -- and my sin. You see, Father --
You idiot.  You almost gave me a massive coronary.
I'm not huggin' you in the middle of the street.  You must be crazy, Julius.
Yeah, him.
We're ready when you are.
And Big Black from Brooklyn, what do you do?
DeLa - what's the matter with you.
What are you talkin' about?
Sloan and I have been looking all over for you.
We was coming to see you.
If it's not too much trouble could you order us some food?
I understand.  But again, in all honesty I was not informed.
I don't agree.  The Negro middle class does exist, and it's rich material for a dramatic series or sitcom.
You got your head stuck up your ass with your Harvard education and your pretentious ways.  Brother man, I'm blacker than you.  I'm keepin' it real and you're frontin', trying to be white.
I'm wid it.
Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  Two real coons.  I know we're way out there but it's satire.
What are there character traits?
Yep, you guessed it.
Protest finally forced "Amos and Andy" off the air.  Could stop us from ever getting on.
Negroes would be in an uproar.
Who are the other characters?
You're telling me some white boy is gonna direct this pilot?
They didn't even view a rough cut, just some scenes we quickly cut together.
This has to be a big mistake.
Go away, unless you got my money.
That's the only reason, period. They only want one certain kind of black comic.
How did you know?
My problem is MANTAN THE NEW MILLENIUM MINSTREL SHOW.
Even if money wasn't an issue, Dunwitty will still go ahead without me and that could be more dangerous.
Hello.
The Jolly Nigger Bank.
Oh, is he?  You getting jiggy with Mantan?
Otherwise.  I trust you know the difference.  You're an intelligent woman, finished at NYU.
Don't make me have to use this.
I told you but you wouldn't listen. You never listened to me.
Pressure?  DeLa, you don't know what the hell real pressure is. SHEEETT!!!  This is lightstuff. Now when you scramblin' out on the street in da January winter and the hawk is talkin' to you with NO money and NO prospects of money anytime soon, now that there is some pressure.
Oh, is it?  Buddy boy, in this business if people don't produce, they get fired.
Sloan is the hardest working person I've ever met.
C'mon, Mommy, don't start with that I'm an ungrateful son stuff.
How's the food?
I know what's on my birth certificate.  You heard from Daddy?
No.
I won't forget.  When are you coming up here to see your mother?
This is a TV show, not a music video.
Let Myrna finish.
What do you mean?
Before we begin, I want to thank you for coming on my show for your first television interview.  You could have chosen Mike Wallace, Barbara Walters, Jane Pauley, whatnot but you're here.
Don't you feel that is a simplistic retort?
Mantan, way too short, too tight. Get her one of dose...
Not for me, my woolly headed cotton pickin' friend for...
...dat's too much money.  I can't 'ford it.  I needs me a dress that cost no mo' than...
...like grits and butter...
I feel a song a comin' on.
What else?
Y'know what?
We did it one time, only once.  It had nothing to do with the job, it was stupid.  Everything I've got I've earned.
Good day to you, young sir.
My companion treated me with great civility, and asked me a thousand questions about England, which I answered as best I might.  But this best, I am bound to say, was bad enough.  I knew nothing about England, and I invented a thousand stories which I told him; described the king and the ministers to him, said the British ambassador in Berlin was my uncle, and promised my acquaintance a letter of recommendation to him.
What is the service, sir?
What are the Chevalier's intentions?
And his baggage?
A pretty day's work of it you have made, Master Roderick.  Knowing your uncle to be distressed for money, and try and break off a match which will bring fifteen hundred a-year into the family?  Best has promised to pay off the four thousand pounds which is bothering your uncle so. He takes a girl without a penny -- a girl that has been flinging herself at the head of every man in these parts these ten years past, and missing them all, and a boy who ought to be attached to your uncle as to your father.
It was with this sword that my late father, Harry James, God rest his soul, met Sir Huddelstone Fuddelstone, the Hampshire baronet, and was fatally run through the neck.  He was quite in the wrong, having insulted Lady Fuddelstone, when in liquor, at the Brentford Assembly.  But, like a gentleman, he scorned to apologize.
I had news of you in Dublin.  Faith, you've begun early, like your father's son, but I think you could not do better than as you have done. But why did you not write home to your poor mother?  She has sent half-a-dozen letters to you in Dublin.
Mr. O'Higgins, we are in your debt, and rest assured, sir, you have friends in this house whenever you are in Dublin.  Mister O'Higgins, I wonder if I know your good father?
Oh, I am thinking of the O'Higgins of Redmondstown.  General O'Higgins was a close friend of my wife's dear father, Colonel Granby Somerset.
Chevalier, though I cannot say how, I believe you have cheated me.
Herr Seebach was a very kind employer.
And I think he was as much affected as I was at thus finding one of his kindred; for he, too, was an exile from home, and a friendly voice, a look, brought the old country back to his memory again, and the old days of his boyhood.
Then you yield to me.
Never.
Not one.
That is true, but it seems to me impossible that you should be unhappy in love.
It is only too possible.  Love requires a mutual harmony which is difficult, and it is even more difficult to make it last.
To love you until death.  To subscribe to all your commands.
Will we always leave it at this?
Let me give a thousand kisses to that heavenly mouth which has told me that I am happy.
I accept, but I insist on a wager. The loser must do whatever the winner pleases.
I hate Miss Clancy, you know I do! And I only danced with her because -- because -- the person with whom I intended to dance chose to be engaged the whole night.
I'd draw my sword, and cut my way through them.
All the same, you must name an amount.
And, to be sure, I did know someone who knew precisely how these things were done, and this was the distinguished solicitor and former Government Minister, Lord West, whose acquaintance I made, as I had so many others, at the gaming table.
But I will have it on my birthday, won't I?
One of the boys in the stable told Nelly that you've already bought my horse, and that it's at Doolan's farm, where Mick the groom is breaking it in.  Is that true, papa?
Good evening, Mr. James, have you done with my lady?
Is it not a pleasure, gentlemen, for me, as I am drawing near the goal, to find my home such a happy one; my wife so fond of me, that she is even now thinking of appointing a successor?  Isn't it a comfort to see her; like a prudent housewife, getting everything ready for her husband's departure?
If his love were like mine, he would not permit you to come here.
He will believe that it will please me if he asks about it, and I shall tell him everything except some circumstances which might humiliate him.
Can I at least have a drink?
Hurricane kept you up, too?
What do we do?
Hey, I --  Holy fuck... holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do?
Before or after the explosion?  Mueller --
We finished the course and came here, then heard an explosion --  Where's Pike?
He's lying.
They would have killed us both. You want me to write a confession, I'll write a confession.
He -- He made me do it --
Are you saying Sergeant West tried to kill you?
That first night with Pike. I made the mistake of letting him sit down at around 0300.
He was sickly. Had that shaking thing, whatd'yacall it, epoxy?
What about the phosphorous grenade?
You know how to work a pistol, Dunbar?
Roberto, what the fuck?
Right?
You hated West more than any of us.
If not you, then who?
Mueller.
That's it. You're that policeman with friends in low places. Tell me, how's Guissepe Torres doing these days? Those racketeering indictments must have really been a downer --
I think you just blew "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" out of the fucking water.
Why did he come back for you?
Epileptic attacks are murder on your system. Rattle your internal organs like a paint mixer.
So I should stay silent about his misdeeds? The guns went off, I ran in, Childs shot me, Pike and Mueller were dead, and Dunbar was running out the door with the smoking gun --
Dunbar was running out the door? Ohhhhhh... See that's where I was confused, because I thought you said Nunez was running out the door.
I didn't --
I don't know --
And the problem is you only got three.
Okay, then let's widen the search to include the endzone in Giants Stadium and the trunk of my car --
It's over. Time of death was 4:42. JAG's been notified and I called the Senator myself. My report will reflect that his medical condition made this unavoidable... you two had no culpability in the matter.
You're drunk --
What I can't understand is why you signed these. If you'd just let West take care of the paperwork, no one would have known, but you got careless. So when Pike finally told the truth you had to get rid of him, too.
No! You will stand there and you will listen! What happened to you, Bill? You were the one who joined up to do good in the world. You were the one who believed in it --
Levi? Who names their kid Levi --
Because interrogation rooms look suspiciously like interrogation rooms, which doesn't exactly put people at ease. Is he cute?
You do understand that there's absolutely no way I could ever be attracted to you, right?
Why do you care?
Are you sure?
That's a fantastic idea --
We can tie you to the chair if it'll work better for you --
Really.
A word of advice about women -- that first hour or so after they kill their boss? Probably not the best time to hit on them.
He was your friend.
The thing is, we've got a real opportunity here. You turn me in tomorrow and we're both fucked --
What are you talking about?
They found him. Poor fucker was practically blown in half --
Oh, you remember now --
So you took off your shirt?
We just want --
I scared Dunbar into silence. He's been trying to cover for me the whole time. We got here, you came to see me... I didn't know if I could trust him with that kind of secret --
Thank God...
Sign here and here.  Hey, ain't you the folks workin' on that whole hulabaloo from last night?
No, no that was Cadet Dunbar --
He's former Army and the best I've ever seen in a room. Besides, he knows the territory, we did Basic together here.  You've had three hours with Dunbar and haven't gotten a peep, we need to take a different tack.
You both know if you do this, if you go after a Senator's son and you're wrong... it's not just me in the hot seat anymore.
Sir, yes, sir!
Those who I deem unworthy to pass through this camp will quit, and those who refuse to quit I will kill. You ever hear of a training accident -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
Sure I do. You were hot shit back in Hickville, but here in the real world, you got squat. You don't have a plan. You don't have a job. You don't have anything but the clothes on your back.
Didn't kill anything, did I?
You won't find a better place!
You get the eye?
Bloom!
Don.
Will.
Not that one. The real story. Did he ever tell you that?
What did she look like?
How old are you?
How are you gonna make it without your shoes?
Then I don't think so Mr. Bloom. If nothing is going to change, I'd just as soon it not change in the way it hasn't been changing all this time.
I won't be selling you this house, Mr. Bloom.
Please. Go. Just go.
I never knew.
You don't like it?
Your mom says I can't tell you that one anymore. You get nightmares.
People needn't worry so much. It's not my time yet. This isn't how I go.
Truly. I saw it in The Eye.
Really.
Did I ever tell you about how...
Son?
Dad, I'm about to have a kid of my own here. It would kill me if he went through his whole life never understanding me.
Like this.
Let's get out of here.
Wait! I need those!
How did you know my father?
Wow. Wow, you just said it. I was expecting to dance around this for another half hour.
Logically, you couldn't be the Witch, because she was old back when he was young.
I'm sorry. It seems every hour I have to...
They met at Auburn.
What about the details? How they fell in love. The Circus. The War. You never told me any of that.
But it's not true.
He's impossible. He won't eat. And because he won't eat, he gets weaker. And because he's weaker, he doesn't want to eat.
How much time does he have left?
What I mean is, do you really know what's going on in his head?
How is that possible? I mean, you try to ask him a question and suddenly it's another one of his stories.  You can't honestly say you know him.
To customers approaching the bank from the rear
You're asking for my documents?
What was that?
Oh nothing.
Do you believe in love?
You can stay tonight.
What does he want. The Russian shithead. What do you want ?
He wants money.
Yes.
Syevodnya?
Unless. Unless this is part of the routine. You get tied up, stick around, distract me, they both bust in and Steal My Cup Of Coffee.
I know you just want to punish me --
You don't have to do this. I can look after myself.
It's none of your business.
And. It's wrong.
And that would be Morals. That would be one's own moral sense of decency.
Some... What does that mean?
It wasn't what I wanted.
Please, there's no... Oh.
Yeah. He's a smashing bloke.
You are pretty naive if you think it is.
I don't have nothing.
Have you had any before?
Did she leave you? Come on. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Who did she leave you for? Your best friend? Her boss? A woman? Did she leave you for a woman, John?
I'm sorry.
I've got news for you. It's not working.
Something else.
I'm sorry.
No. What? No. I know.
It's a long way to go for a date.
You know the rules.  You do know the rules, don't you?
Lazarus?
Angela?
You ain't the kicker, are you?
Cuz let me tell you, you boys gotta run the ball more. You get into a kicking game, ya'll gonna lose.
Some women prefer not to scent their bodies with perfume. So now they have scented creams. They help moisturize a woman's skin.  This one's my favorite. It's called Ginger Souffle. I recommend... applying the cream while the skin is still damp. So... perhaps just after a shower.
What happened?
That's not right, really, cuz I...
You gonna steal my truck?
Better?
Let go...
The fuck you been doin' to me?
What do you want?
Stop it! Stop it! IT HURTS!
Cuz once in a while soil need a change. Corn take up a lot of nitrate in the fertilizer. So next crop what ya do is plant ya some soy beans. That give off a lot of nitrate. Change keeps it all growin' and growin' strong.  Sting a bit?
The seed that land on good soil is for them who hear the word of God... and understand the word of God. Not enough for you to hear what I'm sayin', you gotta understand.
Oh, Laz... he hurt me. He... hurt me so many times.
You took care of your wife, like you do me?
I didn't mean it nothin' dirty.
What I love.
She like it rough? You like beatin' on her?
Now, hold up.
Naw!
Was that Lincoln James I seen run off?
Why's his britches round his knees?
Man like you ought not take the Lord's name like you just done.
I'm tellin' you the truth, dammit. I found her beat. Left for dead. So I brung her home.
Laz, I know about that girl.  Good number of this town's sinners got my ear, you know.  Oh, Laz. She's had a mess of crabs and them STD's. What'chu thinking?
Thank you.
What's on your mind?
I think it'd be better if you talk to me.
Well. That's my vomit. I came in here to get sick. I thought I'd make the toilet but... anyway, I got sick.
You never needed nobody. Always made that clear to me.
Yeah. I know I did. But...  I'm tryin' to be dif'rent. I'm tryin' to... get some peace, you know?
I just think you should'a kept him off me, that's all.
All my life I been puttin' out your fires, with you givin' out your snatch to every waggin' dick in this town. And you gonna lay the blame at my feet? Well, I ain't gonna take that.
... It's not like you were slow or anything... I think you did just fine.  I think you did great.
... I found the goombah... Cavello. He's --
Eating Scungilli, just like the last time you asked.
Maybe we should do something?
Let's grab some food.
Joyce can be nice.
Where're you going, Ichiro?
Nick!
It's Ichiro.  Ich.
What happened?
It may be too soon to talk about it. When someone we care for dies we...  ... keep something of their's.  A tie, a pen.
Yeah...
You said you could keep up with her! 'No problem, Nick-san.'
Gaiijin.
Nick --
... A Godfather.  His man was killed at the printing plant.
It's very small.
Big enough.
It's illegal, Nick.
I was ready to have your ass for taking off on me.
How many men?
A wife.  She left.
Louder, pal, louder.
An outside person.  A foreigner.  A barbarian.  You, me.  More you.
I could use some help.  Show me around.  I'll pay you for your time.
Don't be an ass.
I still think you're a bastard.
She's such a long way home for you.
Why?
You lost a man we wanted for some time.  It was very incompetent on your part, officer.
What's this?
Hey...!  HEY, I'M TALKING TO YOU, INSPECTOR!
You had my help, detective.
If I say no?
You certainly have a nice place here.
What's the point?
But not to last.
Also extraordinary things.
Oh, no bother, I'd be glad to.
We have a lot in common.
He's not ready yet.
We're using Esper -- a 231 -- that picked up Holden's alarm.  Its guess is that all five are in the city.
Look, go home.  Get some rest. Take an aspirin.
Never mind.  Do they have that knowledge?
Those cockroaches?
How old am I?
Love is just another name for sex. Love is sexy and sex is lovely -- I don't care what you call it, an android can't have it.
You're going to be over the limit.
What if you change your mind?
Yes?
Nothing.  She wanted to know about suck night.
Oh, yeah. You'd be surprised what goes on around here.  I'd like to check the dressing room if I could.
Me.
Is there anything else?
Two of us might be more effective than one.
How are you doing?
Yeah.
I don't know... I think I missed something.
Have you ever cleaned your apartment?
But if I don't plug it in how can I...
Don't you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered?
You know what I think?
Where the hell you been?
She didn't know?
And how is it one man will be able to cover so much ground?
Discreetly.
What?
They left.
Beautiful.
You like it?
We want you to come with us so we can talk some more about your experiences.
Let's go talk first, Adam.
How do you do?
We? I'm going home. And, judging by that coat, I'd say you have to get back to the barber college.
Troy? Is he your husband? Or a boyfriend?
Who are these people?
My Mom and Dad.
I guess we'll need another locker.
Yes.
Because I want to get married.
Everybody's divorced.
One who's not a mutant.
Okay, let's see...I'm not promising anything. You okay?
You live in...Alaska.  The only way in or out of your place is by plane and... you've definitely come down here for food and supplies and... to find a wife!
Sure.
No.  We keep it in the backyard.  Of course, in the house.  It's in there.
The what?
Have you ever heard the saying, "He hasn't got enough sense to come in out of the rain?"
Okay. But you know, this business of finding you a wife -- it's kind of ridiculous, don't you think?
Do I look crazy?
I like her.
What have you ordered?
Really?
Yeah.  Could be.  Go say hello, Romeo. Looks like a healthy non-mutant to me.
What?
I know first aid!
...All right, Eve.  If you say so.
We can make this work, Adam! Believe me! I'm very good at making things work!
Sure. Now, let's move on to our French exam.
Uh, no. There's a man who throws the ball -- to a man who has a bat.
No, no! The runner on second goes to third! He's out there!
Your mom made that all by herself.
One more thing. If you find a healthy young woman, bring her back with you.
I do? Well, thank you! You like ceilings?
Not particularly.
This must be very new.
No.
How do you get through those winters?  Well, you're right.  Juneau.  What's the highest peak?
Yeah?
Bye, Troy!
The hotel.
You don't look thirty-five.
How do you do, ma'am.
I see what ya mean. Tell you what...I'll give you five hundred dollars in small bills for the whole box.
Oh. A nice one, I hope.
Your father has a few final words for you. You know, he'd fight a buzz saw for you - he loves you so much. We both do.
We have to go.
According to Caltech, this Webber guy was a bonafide genius and a borderline nutcase.
What about relatives?
Yes, yes, the song.  So tell me...has it been...hell up here?
"Hell up here?"  Honey, it's been hell up here, down there and over yonder! Hell everywhere.
Yes, I can tell that just looking around.  "Boy?"  Did you say you were a "country boy?"
No.  They all do.
You hear that?!
Calvin, I wish you would have at least let me do the dishes. It's not going to be that easy getting all that dried- on food off my nice plates.
Cheese is particularly troublesome.
Worse than your Kraft Holiday dip?
The locks.
To keep us from trying to leave. After an atomic blast there's a radiation half-life that lasts thirty five years.
Maybe I've just got the creeps.
No.  I think it's just right.
Right here!
Oh, I was just examining this rear hatchway.
No reason.  Well, it's pretty clear that the front entrance caved in when the bomb went off. So, you know, when the time is up, we'll have to return to the surface using, you know, this back entrance.  Which is very nice because it has the service elevator!
Get the presents and do the lights.
No kidding.  Who else would have done it?
Would you excuse me?
Mutants?!
And Lord we ask finally that you send an angel to look after and protect our beloved son, Adam.  Amen.
So, Adam...where on earth are you from?
You're serious, aren't you?
Alright, I will.
I think...it...works.
What's that mean?
What's it to you?!
You know, I asked him about that. And he said that good manners are a way we have of showing other people that we respect them. See, you'd eat like a slob if you were alone, but since another human being is present, you show that person respect by going to the trouble of having proper manners. I didn't know that. I thought it was a way of appearing superior.  Know what else he told me?
Well, consider the source. I don't even know what a lady is.
I don't know. I like to think so.
Tower. Wolf One. I've got a problem here.
Okay honey. That sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.
I've seen a few.
Detective Williams here. Yeah. Tell him to go to Sergeant Milton. Yeah, copy.  Well, Jeffrey, you found something which is very interesting to us. Very interesting. I know you must be curious to know more.  But. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you not only not to tell anyone about your find, but also not to ask more about the case. One day, when it's all sewed up, I'll let you know all the details. Right now, though, I can't.
Jeffrey?
These are beautiful. How's the case coming?
Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison your mind by telling you.
What color is it?
No, not at all.
Nobody.
Don?
Then don't talk about killing.
No. But you're in very big trouble.
I want you to hurt me.
No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. Go to the police.
I'll call you.
HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!
Frank gone?
'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for. Frank's got you really loaded tonight.
Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me, and you and really it's all thanks to Don, isn't it. Remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs.
Hello, baby.
Yeah. I guess I did.  What's going to happen to me?
We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though, you're okay. You shot a real son of a bitch.
I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; I need the car this morning.
Do you want the car?
Good to see you, son.
Yeah, how did you know?
Yeah I did, treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something.
I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.
There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. And a musician. And some others.
Maybe so.
Oh yeah. What about those other people? Anything?
Now, how are you going to do that?
Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. I will spray her apartment. After a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window.
It's crazy and dangerous. My God, I shouldn't have told you.
Okay, yeah, call.
Look, it can wait till Sunday.
Okay, thanks.
Well, I've found out some things, nothing really for certain. There are some strange people involved.
What did you see?
Wow. Should you tell my father?
Actually. I've been in twice.
Did you see her undressed?
That's what I thought.
You're sure right. It is a strange world.
You better not, Jeffrey.
I'm really sorry.
Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs. I think Frank supplies him.
Yeah.
Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?
What was that all about?
Where to?
I can't dance fast.
Really?
Jeffrey? What's going on?
I should go with her, Sandy.
What are watchin' this junk for?
I don't know why we have to watch TV.
Hey come here, you stole my girl, you bastard. I'm gonna kick your ass, right in front of your stupid house.
Yes sir.
Look under the body.
The press is everywhere outside. They're going nuts for these guys. What do you want to do?
What?
He probably knew you'd end up nailing the fat guy, maybe one or two more, but he had to know you weren't walking out of there. Figure it out. Shooter's dead on the scene. No in-depth investigation. It'd slide right off his back. 'Cause as much as I love ya, you're not exactly Don Corleone. What would he be losing? A thirty- five year old delivery boy?
No, no. That's just not the way things are done. Besides, how's he know I don't just get in there see there's too many and just serve em their fuckin' food and beat it?
What happened?
What? What is it?
You guys are not under oath, here. I am assuming you knew these two guys from before, huh?
We're alive.
What are you going to do?
Oh, Jesus.
Yeah, these guys always got a lot of rope strapped around em in the movies and they always end up using it.
See. I told you there'd be a shaft.
We'll find it. Just calm down.
Aye.
Oh, we're good man.
We've teamed up with a sex offender.
And it's the same story over here. Why the crossover?  Theories.
How do you figure?
The Greeks. The Italians.
What?
After talking to the dancer we know that their mark was the guy in the middle booth. After she watches them whack him, she passes out.  Why the two extra victims?
This is some heavy shit. This is like Lone Ranger-heavy man. Fuck it! There's so much shit that pisses me off. You guys should recruit 'cause I am sick and fuckin' tired of walkin' down the street waitin' for one of these assholes to get me, y'know?
Who says that? You could take credit on it.
Fuck you!
So?
Worst day of my life, man.
Well he sure as fuck knew you!
Hey! We gotta talk about this early morning church shit.
I guess not.
I believe these young men are right.
Yes.
Don't do this my son.
I always see you talking to the boys and making them laugh. They always come around telling me what a crack up you are. What is it they call you?
Continue the joke.
What color hair does he have?
He says. This is he.
You're making fun of my family. You know there's nothing to steal from my mom and Craig. You know exactly what you're saying.
Dignan, it's got an alarm.
Yeah, I heard that.
But he didn't say anything.
Why not?
I don't want to use it.
What about them?
OK. Go ahead.
Actually. If you knew the exact route, you could plant explosives under a manhole cover and blow it up as it went over.
Dignan, I can't get my hair cut. That's just not possible, all right?
Which one was that?
He needs to hire an attorney.
Mr. Langston performed cardiopulmonary recitation. CPR. I've never said this before, but frankly I thought Anthony was dead. The veins in his face were all sticking out. His skin was blue. He truly did look dead.
He went back for his brother.
He told you and you let him do it.
So when you were saying Bob's at the store and acting real surprised, that was just an act. You were just --
Man. I'm sorry. We just went for a walk --
We've got sixteen dollars.
You gave $383 to the goddamn housekeeper! What the fuck is your problem?
What time did he say to be here?
OK. Man in blue jeans just left by southwest door. He is entering a white van. What time is it?
Roger.
I don't know.
I don't think so. I mean. Actually, he robbed Bob's house.
You think Applejack knew?
How?
Have the car running at the north- west checkpoint. Bob and I'll --
Nice to meet you.
You know, your form is for shit, but you've got a hell of a talent.
I guess what I'm trying to say is what the hell kind of person is this Dignan?
It's private property. Plus I have Hector.
What the fuck is Dignan doing with that cop? He loves them.
Where you going?
I know it must of been a bad experience. But it doesn't sound like it was your fault.
That's pretty complicated for a senior prank.
At first they were going to charge me with manslaughter. That's partly why I was in custody so long. Sixty days.
Yeah. Let's keep it --
How do you say nineteen?
Are you ever scared of finding a dead body in one of these rooms?
Yeah.
Just settling an old score. You might say revenge.
Little Richard. Trust me. You're insane. Jesus, this guy used to carry a percussion bomb around in his trunk. You do not want a guy like that loose on the streets.
He looks like he was designed by scientists. For desert warfare.
If you're that worried, maybe we should just steal one.
You stole a Trans-Am.
No, I was saying crazy like a lunatic.
Where'd she go?
I think we might of scared her.
I'm going to take a look at this.
What's your fucking problem? You're a shithead!
I don't know.
I know it's not.
Yes, I do.
Hey, Dignan. How's it going?
Come on!
I know it, man. Hang on.
Jesus Christ. What the fuck is that?
Where's Applejack?
I said to the DA, That cop who hit me must of given me CRS disease.
We don't have rooms, Bob. We have cells.
You keeping out of trouble?
He said you ran away from home.
Where?
What?
John Mapplethorpe.  How are you. Hi.
Save it for Bourne.
That's not gonna fly.
I want to know what happened.
Dead in a ditch? Drunk in a bar in Mogadishu? Who knows?
Do you know what his budget was?
What's definitive, is that I just lost two people in Berlin!
Why not? It was just money.
No good options left?
No. You lost your way.
And?
Who else knows about this?
Yes...
That's not what happened to your parents.
Then what?
It was my job. My first time. Your father was supposed to be alone. But then your mother, she came out of nowhere...  I had to change my plan.  You understand me?  You don't have to live like that anymore. Thinking that.
How... how can... how can you be here and say this?
You're a liar.
I don't know.
It's just a nightmare.
The Telegraph office.
Look, we clear out, we get to the shack, we get safe. We hang there awhile. I'll come back. I'll check it out. But right now we can't --
What?
-- it's just him? --
I did.
God, I miss you. I don't know what to do without you.
Yes.
Why is she trying to kill me?
My first job.
That's a lie!
I was here!
What do you want?
Looks like he's been detained.
We're talking raw, unprocessed KGB files. It's not something we can go out and comparison shop.
Yes, sir -- ma'am...
So he fooled you.
What do you want from me? I was reassigned. I'm out.
Are we hacking or asking?
We just had a funeral, isn't that what it means in England as well?
I will invade England. And defeat the English on their own ground.
May he rest in peace... You have already sealed the coffin?
Scottish rebels have routed Lord Bottoms!
The weapon has been outlawed by the Pope himself!
What choice do they have? Now they must serve us or starve.
I am cheerful with a plan to soothe your miseries. All of England shudders with the news of renewed rebellion.
I rest.
I don't want to be a martyr.
That's just a dream, William!
You'll move
Is your Poppa a ghost -- or do you converse with God Almighty?
We don't split up!
No. He did not.
No. I have it to ease the suffering of the children of this war.
I do not confess.
I... accept your proposal!
I don't want to scare you. I want to be yours, and you mine. Every night like this one.
This night is too beautiful to have again.
And I with you. But you must wake.
How do you know this?
Did God make you the sacker of peaceful cities? The executioner of the king's nephew, my husband's own cousin?
Sir, I... come to beg you to confess all, and swear allegiance to the king, that he might show you mercy.
Will he show mercy to my country? Will he take back his soldiers, and let us rule ourselves?
And the common man who bleeds on the battlefield, does he risk less?
I am trying.
The dogs have a scent. My scent. Someone must have given it to them.
What is it?
Why? What for?
Well, the good news is that the results are negative. I've found no evidence in the way of lesions, hemorrhaging, tumors...
But he's seven. What kind of stress can he have?
You'd be surprised how often they are.
Evan wake up, oh please wake up!
Please, mom. People will talk.
I can't help it. I'm just so proud of you. You've got the highest grades in all of your classes.
Please. He got straight A's without ever touching a book. That was the one area where his memory never failed him.
No, it's just weird with him being such a brain and all, I just wondered if he was ever able to remember stuff he'd forgotten.
And then, just before it got so bad that he had to be committed, he said that he could...
...I spoke to your new lawyer about the appeal. He's sure he can get you off on self-defense, so if you're patient.
Fix?
You're religious Carlos, you believe that bit about "the Lord works in mysterious ways?"
But I... I need those books.
I thought you were a December baby.
What the fuck are you doing?
Huh?
I've stopped a hundred times.
Of course.
Just shut up, Evan. You're wasting your breath.
What do you think it is about us that makes us so perfect? Like, looking back, whatever gave you the nerve to sneak out and visit me after I moved away?
Yeah, right. Tell that to Crockett.
Ha! Where's that?
You wouldn't believe me. I mean, people always say, "You wouldn't believe me", but in this case, it's not even worth trying.
Because you're... different.
Oh? There's proof now?
Kayleigh? Do you ever think about "us?" I mean, wonder if it could ever have been different between the two of us?
I was?
Thumper had a busy afternoon.
That should buy you ten minutes at least.
What do you need it for? I don't get you lately.
Destroy it?
It wasn't enough that the whole world loves you, but you had to take away the last person on earth who didn't think I was a piece of shit.
Shut up, Tommy!
You put the mommy too far away. Mrs. Boswell has macaroni and glue if you wanna fix it.
Monsieur Rick?
Yes?
My husband is with me, too.
And you want to know --
-- Will he keep his word?
Oh, but if you knew what it means to us to leave Europe, to get to America! Oh, but if Jan should find out! He is such a boy. In many ways I am so much older than he is.
Excuse me, but you look like a couple who are on their way to America.
What is your name?
Mr. Berger, the ring, could I see it again?
I want you to turn out the light in the rear entrance. It might attract the police.
You haven't heard my offer.
I don't buy or sell human beings.
I have a proposition for whoever has those letters. I will handle the entire transaction, get rid of the letters, take all the risk, for a small percentage.
I'll tell him when he comes in.
Don't forget, you owe Rick's a hundred cartons of American cigarettes.
We've decided, Signor Ferrari. For the present we'll go on looking for two exit visas. Thank you very much.
Do you know where they are?
Uh huh. Under a safe conduct from me.
How nice. You remembered. But of course, that was the day the Germans marched into Paris.
No.
There's still nobody in the world who can play "As Time Goes By" like Sam.
We said "no questions."
No, no, no, no. We must leave.
Yes, I guess it is a little too far ahead. Well, let's see. What about the engineer? Why can't he marry us on the train?
Please don't. Don't, Rick. I can understand how you feel.
Why did you come back? To tell me why you ran out on me at the railway station?
I don't think I will, Rick.
Why not? After all, I got stuck with a railway ticket. I think I'm entitled to know.
Did you run out on me because you couldn't take it? Because you knew what it would be like, hiding from the police, running away all the time?
Your unexpected visit isn't connected by any chance with the letters of transit? It seems that as long as I have those letters I'll never be lonely.
I went through all that with your husband. It's no deal.
It was your cause, too. In your own way, you were fighting for the same thing.
No. Oh, Richard, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but, but you, you are our last hope. If you don't help us, Victor Laszlo will die in Casablanca.
Put them on the table.
And then?
It wasn't long after we were married that Victor went back to Czechoslovakia. They needed him in Prague, but there the Gestapo were waiting for him. Just a two-line item in the paper: "Victor Laszlo apprehended. Sent to concentration camp." I was frantic. For months I tried to get word. Then it came. He was dead, shot trying to escape. I was lonely. I had nothing. Not even hope. Then I met you.
No, not yet.
I'm saying it because it's true. Inside of us we both know you belong with Victor. You're part of his work, the thing that keeps him going. If that plane leaves the ground and you're not with him, you'll regret it.
Not tonight no more. He ain't coming. Uh, he went home.
Play it, Sam. Play "As Time Goes By."
You are very kind.
He does. Could we have a table close to him?
-- Yes?
-- Is what?
And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.
Good evening. You see, here we are again.
Go ahead.
I said, ask your wife.
Well, this might come in handy.
Don't you sometimes wonder if it's worth all this? I mean what you're fighting for?
Monsieur Blaine, I don't know how to thank you.
Oh, never mind about that. You won't have any trouble in Lisbon, will you?
I understand.
Merely to welcome you to Casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay. It is not often we have so distinguished a visitor.
Very well, Herr Laszlo, we will not mince words. You are an escaped prisoner of the Reich. So far you have been fortunate enough in eluding us. You have reached Casablanca. It is my duty to see that you stay in Casablanca.
And what if you track down these men and kill them? What if you murdered all of us? From every corner of Europe, hundreds, thousands, would rise to take our places. Even Nazis can't kill that fast.
For the time being.
Oh, we Germans must get used to all climates, from Russia to the Sahara. But perhaps you were not referring to the weather.
By the way, the murder of the couriers, what has been done?
Oh, there is no hurry. Tonight he'll be at Rick's. Everybody comes to Rick's.
Champagne and a tin of caviar.
You repeat "Third Reich" as though you expected there to be others.
Ho, diplomatist!
Rick is completely neutral about everything. And that takes in the field of women, too.
But everybody's having such a good time.
Hello, Louis.
The plane to Lisbon.  You would like to be on it?
I see. And what's Strasser doing here? He certainly didn't come all the way to Casablanca to witness a demonstration of your efficiency.
Victor Laszlo.
Rick, that is the first time I have ever seen you so impressed.
Is that a serious offer?
Why two?
He is traveling with a lady.
The winning side would have paid you much better.
Maybe. Well, it seems you are determined to keep Laszlo here.
Yeah, you were saying?
Well, you were asking about Rick and here he is. Mademoiselle, may I present --
Oh, no, Rick never --
Well, I told Strasser he wouldn't find the letters here. But I told my men to be especially destructive. You know how that impresses Germans?  Rick, have you got these letters of transit?
Louis, are you pro-Vichy or Free French?
Ricky, I'd advise you not to be too interested in what happens to Laszlo. If by any chance you were to help him escape --
I'll arrange to have Laszlo come there to pick up the letters of transit, and that'll give you the criminal grounds on which to make the arrest. You get him, and we get away. To the Germans that last will be just a minor annoyance.
There's still something about this business I don't quite understand. Miss Lund, she's very beautiful, yes, but you were never interested in any woman.
I thought I asked you to tie up your watchdogs.
Have you taken leave of your senses?
What you just did for Laszlo, and that fairy tale that you invented to send Ilsa away with him. I know a little about women, my friend. She went, but she knew you were lying.
Anyway, thanks for helping me out.
Give me another.
You will forgive my curiosity, Mr. Blaine. The point is, an enemy of the Reich has come to Casablanca and we are checking up on anybody who can be of any help to us.
Oh, nothing. But when you first came to Casablanca, I thought --
They got a lucky break. Yesterday they were just two German clerks. Today they're the 'Honored Dead'.
But think of all the poor devils who cannot meet Renault's price. I get it for them for half. Is that so parasitic?
I don't mind a parasite. I object to a cut-rate one.
Who did you bribe for your visa? Renault or yourself?
For how long?
Don't be a fool. You can't get away.
Well, I ain't sleepy either.
Shut up and go home, will you?
Feels so good to lie here.
But I have promises to keep.  And miles to go before I sleep.  And miles to go before I sleep.  Got to fix the sea anchor.  Use the sail.
That's death knocking, knocking on your door.  Crazy little woman come knocking, knocking at my front door...
You know, Wilson, every now and then we should say thank you.  Thank you God.
Nothing out there but ocean.
Want to come in?  Get dry for a minute.
Yeah, a long one.
Merry Christmas eve.
A puppy's got a little more personality than a fish.
Maybe now's when you tell me about it.
You okay?
I need the latest PDRs on St. Petersburg.
Sorry...sorry... Why do my joints still ache?
Hey, once a driver, always a driver.  You want a lift?  I've just got one more pickup.
What a journey you've had.  It seems more than a person should have to bear.
Trying.
Hmmm.  Durango, Colorado; Asheville, North Carolina, then...canceled her account.
You fucked us over.
The point of FedEx, as I understand it, is to make the damn connection.
You've been over the line and you came back.  You've been saved, hallelujah!
Take your time.
What, then?
You want that delivered, we'll deliver it.  That's what we do.
Would you do us the honor of joining us? We're just sitting down at mess.  Pork chops and gravy, cranberries, baked potatoes with all the trimmings, fresh- baked bread, apple pie...
Oh, just stop it! You knew this was going to happen. He's a young man.
He *smells* like he could put you to sleep!
Whoever they were, they didn't *do* any of the things parents are supposed to do. Dr. Larch did those things, and Nurse Edna, and Nurse Angela.
And that I can drive a truck!
They'll believe it because they want to believe it.
He's going to be dropping bombs on Mandalay! They're going to be shooting at him!
You've seen only one movie? Which one?
And what did she die of, exactly?
At least you were never lonely.
Privacy is exactly the point of drive- in movies.
You just cuddle. You come to hug... to kiss. You don't *come* here to watch the movie.
No! That's not all there is to it! I love you, too--I *know* I do.
He's *alive*. He still loves you.  So do I.
Please don't make me say it again.
I never said they were boring.
"Homer Wells, born Portland, Maine, March 2, 1915..."
Is *your* father dead?
*Alcohol* killed him--he drank himself to death.
Has anyone offered you anything to eat?
Where are you going?
They're migrants.
Migrants?
What about the trees?
Are we supposed to be up here? The rules said...
Cider don't have no taste till later in October--it's too watery now, when we're usin' just them early Macs and them Gravensteins. You don't get no *good* cider till you're pickin' them Golden Delicious and them Winter Bananas, them Baldwins and them Russerts...
What about the worms? Most of these apples are the drops--off the ground, right? There have to be worms.
I presume you'd prefer handling the delivery.
Henceforth you shall be... Little Wilbur.
It's just my heart.
Not yet. What do you know about it?
*Happy*! What are you thinkin'? How am I supposed to take care of a baby! I can't have a baby.
Who cares?
Shit. We don't know what he is.
You pickin' nothin' but cider apples, Peaches--I hope you understand that.
Don't let us make you nervous or nothin'--we know you gotta job to do.
*You* taught her, I suppose...
Rose Rose has runned away!
My name's Grant. Grant Ashby.
No, no. Nothing like that. I work in a bank.
Here's where a little research comes in handy. Corporate banks give out VP titles like calendars. It's a small lie, but now we're sure he's playing.
A capacity for gross fund recovery. Yeah, we got that part.
Listen, what I'm about to tell you, I'm telling you in confidence, okay?  Have you ever heard of a company called Big.Com?
Right. The guys who started that did what a lot of companies in the Valley do. They get a good idea, shop it around, raise some capital, then sell it off to a bigger company. Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, whatever. The beauty of it is, they've pretty much sold the company before they're even real. The bigger company is already set to buy it, all they want to do is make sure that the idea actually works. So they get some start up capital, make it work, then sell it for like five times the initial loan.
Then there it is. Ashby gets the itch.
Hey, Jake... When am I gonna get to play the Inside?
And I think it's because of this redhead...
Gee... What makes you say that?
Keep going. I want to know how you got Lionel Dolby.
So you want to know how to play the Big Con.
But there were other factors.
Is that what it was, Jake? Was it love?
After you cut her loose.
Alrlght, alrlght. What happened today?
Currently, the King Pin is a very large-type pole stuck up our asses.
Independent. Same shit, just independent. They call him the King Pin because he looks like that guy from the comic book... Big. Fat. Bald.
Jake...
It can buy you a new and better you.
We only owe the King a hundred and fifty.
How's that? He works for Gillette.
She got one leg out from under him. Now we had to lean.
Calls?
Stake you?
All the shit we pulled with you and you're trying to shake us down? You guys got sack.
I don't know what you're into with the King Pin, but whatever it is we get a piece, understand? We get a big piece. If we find out you're keeping us out, I may suddenly develop a conscious and give you up to Moonan myself. Say something stupid if we got a deal, Jake.
Attractive girl.
What about... The money?
That's not --
We have work. It pays a lot. Unless you figure on getting rich lifting wallets while old guys feel you up.
Alright! Hold up. You win. You got the job.
No.  What's my cut?
Don't worry about it.
You need to get a haircut.
Why?
Uh-huh.
Are you asking me if I have something to prove?
Not in that repressed anger sort of way.
Intuition. It doesn't make you Yoda. Like tonight. You killed that guy tonight. But I knew you would.
Who says you have to know the King to be in a hole? I actually did have a real job once. When I was in high school, I worked as a candy striper.
He wasn't my boyfriend. I had a boyfriend at the time... What was his name? Anyway, Glenn was like thirty. I was only fifteen. But he was a nice guy. Real sweet. Liked to talk. We used to get loaded on pills from the nurses station and then listen to Morrisey or some stupid shit like that.
Did, uh... Did you kill him?
What about what?
Stop waving that thing around.
No. Big con. One rag. One rag and we get out from under all this. But we need another Shill.
Yeah, well we're still a little young for Albany State Prison. Are you pissed about Al? I'm pissed too, but I'm not like "twenty-five to life" pissed.
What do we do? We change the scam?
No, no, no! Not this time. I am doing this for your own good! You guys have got to learn when to stop. You with the Armani! You with the hookers!
Feeling lucky today, Miles. Found a penny -- Heads up. There was an empty cab right outside my building. We hit every green light.
King ain't gonna like this.
Eee Oott Auught!
Sorry. What?
I want to get out from under all this for good. And I want to fuck them all doing it.
Ten percent.
The King, huh? Nice going.
What?
Preliminary forensics suggests he was sitting there, bloated and purple in his egg foo young for at least seventy two hours. Alfonse was not a small man and there was a lot of food ordered, so you can imagine the smell. Bad for the neighbors, good for me because in all the time I've been looking for Jake, this is only the second time I've even gotten a whiff of him.
If you Feds are so hot for him, why don't we just bring him in right now?
He's headed towards the eastern most exit. Do not, under any circumstances approach. I want to follow this all the way down to Vig.
You trust this Moonan guy?
Hi, Jack.  Welcome to the cesspit.
I despise the job.
Reynolds got a doctor in. They forced me to take a dope test. It was positive. As you knew.
What kind of deal you looking to?
Three years, two months. March '93.
Did she?  You were pretty thick at one time.
All right. As what?
Jack, look, next weekend I'm having a house party. Here...  It's near Oxford. Why don't you come? It'll just be social. No business.  Bring a friend. I've plenty of room.
She's a dab hand With a racquet, your friend.
Last hand.
Get what?  Are you accusing me of cheating?
Good night?
Are you trying to read my palm?
-- It's because of the sex, isn't it? You don't like the sex in it.
Marion. It's a book.
Oh really. Then why is he called Jake. Why don't you come clean and call him Jack.  There's no hope in it.
It's the truth.
That girl, she works at the casino --
Marion!  What did you tell the police?
Then what?
I hate public transport.
That's stupid. What are the odds of you being seen with me?
We all came from Africa, supposedly.
You're serious.
I can't do it, Jani.
Did they tell you to sleep with me?
Do you?
The date's not set yet. I'll call you. One last thing: the man you're going to catch cheating, he may get violent. But you know how to deal with cheats.
You did?
How long have you worked at the casino?
Look Matt, there's something I have to say to you. I saw you cheating.
I don't get you. Even if it was true, which it isn't, what the fuck difference would it make to you?
You're talking about complicity.
No thanks.
I put them on together.
We check every four days.
Why four? And not three or five?
I don't think so.
How many aces are left?
This is our Crow's Nest. I'm showing it to you now, but you'll never see it again.
I have a reduced drive reading of seven thousand.
I hope it's not the oven again.
I can tell, the damn thing just doesn't understand.
Where's the fail-safe key?
The key!
The key, goddamit, the key!
Fuck that shit.
Everything sounds fine, bomb. Dropping you off in sixty seconds. Good luck.
Hello, bomb.
Hey, bomb.
Hey, bomb...
Hello, bomb, are you with me?
Intriguing. I wish I had more time to discuss this matter.
Of course not.
...you may be doing so on the basis of false data.
You know, Talby, you really ought to eat with the rest of us. You spend too much time up here.
Must get lonely being up here so much.
Yes, Talby, what is it?
Ah, Lieutenant Doolittle? Sir?
Sh, Talby, don't bother me now.
Before we get too far away, and our signals start to fade, I just wanted to tell you... you were my favorite. I really liked you, Doolittle.
Commander Powell, this is Doolittle. Ah, there's something serious come up, sir, and I have to ask you something.
Oh, yes... Well, Doolittle, if you can't get it to drop you'll have to talk to it.
That's not why we're here.
Call the skank now or I start redecorating.
Some of us are trying to sleep.
Leave.  Now.
You mean until you showed up?
Trying to have a relationship with you, Max, is like standing in a fog bank.  You know you're in the middle of something only you have absolutely no idea where you are.
Why would I be pissed?
I was crazy about you...am crazy about you.  But you keep everyone at arm's length like there's some great big dark something going on that-- I don't know... It's just that the more I tried to get close to you, the more you pulled away.
Must think you're pretty special laying this on you.
Thanks, it's starting to kick in.  I feel almost human.
Your daughter's the only leverage they have to keep you quiet.
Guess it wasn't the pizza delivery guy.
You have good taste.  French, 1920's, attributed to Chitarus.
Whoever that is.
Who is...
Lemme get my coat.
Now you know who I am, where I live.  I figured I better find out who I'm dealing with in case you were looking to hurt me.
Too early to tell.
Is the social studies class over for today?
It was open.
I don't know what kind of game you're playing here but I'm out because you are a whack-job.
I know they made me.  Even got the label on my neck to prove it.
Yeah, I catch your hacks.  He's Satan's lap dog, or something.
It turned up on the black market.  One of my sources thought I might be interested.
I don't know what to say.
You are involved.  By being alive you're involved.
And you still think you can do something to change that.
Know where I can find her?
She may be easy on the eyes but she's trouble, trust me.  Hot run to two-oh-two Sansomme.
How do I know you're telling the truth?
He got the car in a trade for his old pick-up and some food...no bill of sale or nothing.  It was right after the pulse so all the DMV records were wiped.  So we don't get anything on the seller.  Except I actually managed to find this guy, six hours on the phone... Say thank you.
Guy says he made the trade in Gillette, Wyoming sometime in the fall of oh-nine.
How's this about me?
Sure you wanna be havin' this conversation over the phone?
Zero... C'mon, Dan I don't have all day.
You're way more philosophical than I could ever be.
A fog bank.
Gotta go.
Where?
I actually know how this works.
Don't believe everything you hear on TV.
Then a sympathetic mouth, then a sympathetic--
You set up on Lydia.  When she's on her way over to the apartment you give me the heads up.  I answer the door and pretend to be Natalie.
--a philandering pig.
You would be making a mistake to come away from this thinking she's the villain in the piece... You are.
True, but--
Okay, okay, okay--
I was on call. 
And Theo can't pick up his own check because?...
Right, well, thanks for the drinks and stuff, Amanda, but there's no reason for me to stick around these parts anymore.
And he loves you back, doesn't he?
He's a little spoiled, but I know he does.
We've got to take this slow...
Right, slow...
So. Is it true that Gene Simmons had a cow's tongue grafted onto his real one? Y'know, to make it so long?
Ann Arbor?
Coming dad.  I'll call you. Soon as we get a phone. Bye.
Wonder if you could smoke shit out of this?
Will somebody please tell those chicks disco is dead.
Damn straight we are.
Now listen up. Here's the game plan.
Could be.
Are you gettin' wise with me?
Hawk?
Are you on the crapper with one of those antenna phones? Sounds like you're taking a dump the size of Butte, Montana.
Anyway, listen up. They're gone!
Gone!? Why would I have the KISS tick...?
Oh no, Jam. I'm not falling for that twice.
It doesn't mean anything. Don't pay attention to him.
Hey, Look at the front entrance! A car's pulling out. The parking space from heaven. God is surely smiling down upon us tonight, dudes.
I'm sorry, guys. I thought it was a nice thing to do.
But... my plan involves all four of us acting together.
Change? What's wrong with what I got on?
Jeremiah... what's gotten into you?
Yeah.
Alright, Father, here it is. About two weeks ago I went to my cousin's wedding and one of the bridesmaids asked me if I wanted to take a bath.
That's some sick shit right there. Did she comb your ass hair for you too?
The Chinese have a proverb: "That which appears too good to be true, usually is." There's gotta be a catch.
Simplicity, Hawk.
Really, Trip, can we bore holes in your head and use it as a bong so it actually does us some good for a change?
What do you want?
Please, sir, don't kick my ass! I'll do anything to get out of a beating!
That's all the gusta you can musta? I said, "Good morning!"
Now that's better... but I still sense some students out there... who are AFRAID... just to say GOOD MORNING!
Are you AFRAID?
Beg pardon?
Well, if you're innocent, then you have nothing to worry about.
It is the name of my father... and his father before me.
Don't knock soap. Without it, disease would spread rapidly. If we ran out... you and I would never live to see the year 2000.
Will you go with me?
So, we call them... IMGs.
Time is running out. We have to go see Grandma Death. We have to talk to her.
Why? Is this about the book?
I wish I knew where you went at night.  Did you toilet paper the Johnson's house?
So how was school today?
No... apparently they can't tell us what happened yet. Something about a matching serial number that got burned.  But I had to sign a form saying I wouldn't talk to anyone about it.
So we're not supposed to tell anybody what nobody knows?
I know, Dad.
Ms. Pomeroy... what's going on?
That's bullshit. You're a good teacher.
His name is Frank.
I think he saved my life.
What is her name?
Yes.
I think that Frank wants me to go to this woman.  She wrote a book about time travel. Frank asked me if I believed in time travel. That can't just be a random coincidence.  My dad almost hit her with the car the other day, and she said the creepiest thing. She said that every living creature on this earth dies alone.
It was just like she described them in her book. Like they were alive. The way that they looked... moved... smelled. They were like workers... assigned to each one of us.  I followed my spear... and I found something...
Yeah, but if I told her about the other stuff about Frank...
I mean... Gretchen... She won't even let me kiss her. She says because it's our first kiss... she's, like, waiting for this big... moment or something. I just don't get it. I just want to get it over with so we can move on to the good stuff.
Yes.
Yes. I flooded my school... and I burned down that pervert's house. I think I only have a few days left... before they catch me.
I think now that he might...
It's too late. I've already ruined my life.
No I don't.  She worries about you.
Well, don't worry... I'm taking my medication.
I was just being honest.
Mom and Dad won't be back until Sunday night. It's Halloween Carnival. We should throw a party. We could totally get away with it.
Donnie is experiencing what is commonly called a daylight hallucination.
Excuse me?
Here are the keys to the Taurus. There's plenty of groceries in the fridge. And I left money on the kitchen table. And don't forget...
Kitty, I would appreciate... if you could wait...
She's alive, sweetie.
Oh, Mom's okay. They're just givin' her a ride back. She almost blew outta the back of Loretta's pick-up on the way over.
Thank God for bunge cords.
I never liked her, but she didn't deserve to die in the belly of a swan like that. The whole thing's just kinda sad and lame at the same time.
Our baby's going to Nationals! Lincoln, Alabama -- look out!
Amber? Here.
Huh?
I -- I'm wearin' this costume. I'm, uh, I'm gonna do my talent tonight.
Sorry. I just thought she might not wanna meet her Maker lookin' like a cheap whore.
Hey, Amber, y'get my smokes?
Oh shit!
Oh, Mom, it's so ugly.
Mom!
I ain't lettin' go ktil you tell me what's up. I'm reaching' a point where I'd kill someone for the nicotine on their fingernails.
Okay, okay!  Listen-up. Coupla notes from last night's dress rehearsal.  Number one, Gladys says a coupla yous are gettin' sexy with your hips durin' the "Physical Fitness" routine...
I hate her!
Yeah...
Yes...
I know it doesn't matter, but on my inner thighs.
Okay... well, bye.
Hi.
Why don't you paint a big red target on your ass, Loretta.
Go on home, Loretta. Come on. Go on, the party's over.
Well, it's all happenin' so fast. Goodness-gracious, it hardly seems real, y'know? I mean, I won! I'm the winner! I'm going to State!
Tammy Curry?
Girls check in, but they don't check out.
Oh, there's a parking space over there. Oh, no, that's just a compact. Sorry.
Enid ate a whole pan!
Close up shop. Close up shop, Hank.
The king can do to wrong! 
King Solomon was game he gave each Girl his name to number them would make a list that long I'll bet his thousand wives led miserable lives if the king can do no wrong.
"My President"...
Dear Sir... enclosed find check for $100.  Yours very truly...  Send that immediately.
Have you got a license?
Yankee Poodle.
I'm sorry I'm not in.  I wanted to have a long talk with you...  Now look here, my good man, you've got to stop yelling "peanuts" in front of the House of Representatives.
You wouldn't consider going over Niagara Falls without a barrel?
Then you don't wanna work hard?
I don't want to buy ammunition -- we no gotta war.
He's-a very easy to insult --  I say something to his niece once, and he slapped my face.
Well, we gotta one hundred thousand men.
That's-a pretty good.  I'll take a dozen of them.
So! -- He's on your side, too.
Are you getting tired?
Your Excellency, haven't we met before?
You worm!
What'll I do with this card?
Well, I won't stand for much.  And I won't stand for you if you don't show some improvement soon.  Look at your report card last month -- "D" in spelling...  six in behavior. Now who were the six?  A fine state of affairs -- no wonder you can't matriculate, now what were you saying?
The future of Freedonia rests upon you.  Promise me you will follow in my husband's footsteps.
No wonder he passed away.  I'd like to be with you to the very end. Can't you see what I'm trying to tell you -- I love you.
Oh, Rufus!
I hope I'm not interrupting.
Your Excellency, something terrible has just happened.
But -
Mrs. Teasdale, I'm willing to pocket my pride and do anything I can to make up with his Excellency.
Maybe it's not going to be so easy. From what I've heard, Mrs. Teasdale is rather sweet on this Rufus T. Firefly.
This is all Firefly's fault -- that idiot, that fool...
Hmmm?
Oh, Freddie. What could that wretched vampire say to upset you?
Aw, Bytes, he's sick.
He's a freak! That's how they live. We're partners, him and I, business partners. You're willfully deprivin' me of my livlihood!
Why isn't he in the General Ward, then?
Have you contacted the British Home and the Royal Hospital?
No, Treves, it's out of the question. Now if it was up to me, I'd say "Certainly, let's meet the fellow, by all means," I'm sorry, I simply can't speak for the other members of the committee.
He needn't. I have no desire to cause him any discomfort. Did you make those inquiries we spoke about?
Can you imagine what his life has been like?
No, not that way. Broadneck and the others don't like to deal with patients directly. It makes them queasy... Do you have any photographs of Mr. Merrick?
How are you feeling today?
...I... everyone has been very kind to me.
I want you to know that I don't go about giving my pictures to just anyone.
Why, Mr. Merrick, you're not an Elephant Man at all...
Oh no?
Yes. There is nothing more frustrating, nothing that makes a physician feel more useless, than standing by watching his patient deteriorate. And when that patient is a friend, no... no, there's absolutely nothing I can do.
Oh no, my friend...
Thank you very much.
The hallway? Oh, the wastecan!
Merrick...
Why, my dear Mrs. Mothershead, how good of you to join us. Mr. Merrick, will you please introduce yourself?
Righteousness...
Why did you let me go on like that, teaching you what you already knew? Why didn't you tell me you could read?
Yes.
The hospital?
Oh yes.
Would you... would you like to see my mother?
No John, I can't. I can care for you, but I can't cure you.
You want a dressing bag, John?
You did this for me?
Mr. Treves, tell me... tell me truly. Is it alright, did I make any mistakes that you can see?
Good Lord, Mr. Treves!
Mr. Treves, some more books arrived for Mr. Merrick.
WHERE IS MR. MERRICK?
YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME! I ain't done nothing wrong. People pay to see your monster, Mr. Treves. I just take the money.
Just one of the curious. I'd like to see it.
Right! Where is he?
That's just what I was trying to tell you. You ARE...
Who?
Where's the Cloak Invisible?
No!
Of course.
Oh, no no no! It's just the Horn Resounding is...
No... right... this is RAPE... Mark you, I'm not saying I couldn't get to like you... in fact... well, to be quite honest, I prefer it when there's some sort of mutual feeling between two people...
I don't suppose... no...
You DON'T like it, do you?
Ah.
Louder.
Have you tried to ask the God for anything?
Is THAT Odin?
But...
I know!
But. You're not even afraid of DEATH, Thorfinn!
What's it all about?
We toil and labor, we loot and pillage, rape and kill... and yet...
He can have my place. I don't want to go anyway.
Leif, you sit there. Even, you sit there. Harald, you'd better sit over there...
I've got you!
There is another way.
Bjorn's not. He could have Bjorn's place.
And you, Keitel Blacksmith.
Don't you see, Erik! She wants revenge!
Hy-Brasil?
Bye, Leif.
What's all the panic about?
For your own sake... For the others... I...
What are you doing, Keitel Blacksmith?
Sh! Hurry!
Help!
She knows it was our fault!
Keep your mouth shut, Keitel!
By YOU -- Keitel Blacksmith! Don't you know, Erik, that is why he went with you? Ragnarok was good for his business...
I went berserk in every battle I ever fought for King Harald...
There! THAT'S a true Berserk.
And something to sharpen them with?
I remember you turned around. Your face was dark and your hair was backlit -- I could see a halo of frizz -- you asked me if things were okay between Naomi and me.
Who was the girl you walked off with?
You guess he's your boyfriend? Or you guess you're having a bad time with him?
I'm sorry.
Why?
I don't really know how --
Someone's got that job.  Agent Orange! I came up with that one. Anyway, there are endless color possibilities and I'd be great at it.
My writing career! Your hair written by Clementine Kruczynski.  The Tom Waits album is Rain Dogs.
No jokes about my name? Oh, you wouldn't do that; you're trying to be nice.
I don't know what that means.
Now I'm nice? Don't you know any other adjectives? There's careless and snotty and overbearing and argumentative... mumpish.
Joel? It's Joel, right?
Well, I probably wouldn't say if I were, but no.
Me too. It is Rain Dogs, by the way.
Ready for another?
No, stay. Just for a little while.  Refill?
Exactly. Exactly! That's exactly my feeling about it. It's hard to know. Like, okay, but how many times do I think something and it doesn't happen? That's what you're saying, right? You forget about those times. Right?
Sorry. My life isn't that interesting. I go to work. I go home. I don't know what to say.
I do have a tendency to use that word too much.
That's scary sounding.
Sounds good. But right now I should go.
You'll call me, right?
I don't want to talk about this here.
You don't tell me things, Joel. I'm an open book. I tell you everything. Every damn embarrassing thing. You don't trust me.
I just don't have anything very interesting about my life.
Yes indeed.  Fuck! They're erasing you, Clem!
You know, we're okay. They're not finding us. You'll remember me in the morning. And you'll come to me and tell me about us and we'll start over.
He stole a pair of your panties while you were being erased!
I want to enjoy my little time left with you.
But you weren't. I could tell.
I told her today I need to end it.
Well, you're married.
You know what I did.
I know.
Okay.
I think I should go back.
Listen, did you want to make love?
Oh, um...
Because I just am not drunk enough or stoned enough to make that happen right now.
Says you were a slob, leaving trails of panties and dirty socks in your wake.
I can't. I have to go home. I'll do it later.
Is there any sort of risk of brain damage?
I'm sorry you saw one of our notification cards. You never should have.
You have to stop this!
I think maybe, we're both so used to operating at this level that -- How can one person be unhappy? If one person is unhappy, both have to be... by definition.
Hi.
I'm sorry. I really shouldn't have --
Okay, Joel. I suppose you're right.
So I'm going to get some sleep. I'm glad you're okay.
Very cool. Trippy.
Stan... c'mon...
Nietzsche. Beyond Good and Evil. Found it my Bartletts.
Don't you think Howard's like that? Smart? Important?
You better go.
Nothing.
Okay, um, there's one that goes "Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders."
It was a mutual decision.
The guy we're doing? He's disappeared from the map. I can't find him anywhere.
Not a dump, then, but kind of plain. Uninspired. And there's a stale smell. Sort of stuffy. I don't know. Stuffy.
She was unconscious, Patrick.
She was beautiful. So sweet and funky and voluptuous. I kind of stole a pair of her panties, is what.
What's your bartlett's?
I'm a friend of Bonanza Jellybean's.
Yes, everything is getting worse. But everything is also getting better.
No, I'm afraid that part isn't true. Jack was in awe of me and tracked me down. We spent a night talking and hugging in a corn field, but he was hardly my lover. Besides, I always travel alone.
No, I guess not.
'Drugged' is a stupid word.
Every time I tell you that I love you, you flinch. But that's your problem.
Oh, we didn't get it all the way on.
Tired...
A job for me?
That means top-secret, Cooper.
You prep the gravity couches. I'm going to manually arm those explosives.
I'd rather spend the next twelve hours Outside than another five minutes in this can. This ship is bad. It watches you.
The Event Horizon only had life support for eighteen months. It seems impossible, but in light of the transmission... I have to think that someone has managed to endure until now.
How is he?
DJ. The Clark's gone. Smith and Cooper are dead.
Please... kill...
It's against my better judgement, but I'll run this by the Man downstairs. You'll know my decision by the end of the day.
You don't just dismiss Bill Weir. The man held Oppenheimer's chair at Princeton. If the Event Horizon had worked, he would have gone down in history as the greatest mind in physics since Einstein.
I've reached another containment door. This thing's huge...
That's the Second Containment Seal. Beyond that, engineering.
Justin, finish your sweep.
The ship had life support systems for eighteen months. They're been gone seven years.
I put in for a replacement for you but no one...
That means they didn't abandon ship.
I can see the hatch.
...how's the client?
Doctor Weir, my crew is not going on your mission because we want to. We were pulled off a well deserved leave, to be sent out to the middle of nowhere, and no one's even told us why.
I've been authorized to brief you and the crew once we reach Neptune space.
That is not acceptable --
Yes.
We barely have enough power for life support as it is, if we can't stop the drain, we're not gonna make it.
I want to know what caused that noise. I want to know why one of my crew tried to throw himself out of the airlock.
You said this ship creates a gateway...
Yes...
Where has it been for the past seven years?
You can't leave. She won't let you.
You can't have them. Go to hell.
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
She was right behind me, I turn around, she's gone. She could be anywhere.
Skipper...
It tastes bad.
The Event Horizon sensors show the same thing: "Bio-readings of indeterminate origin." Right before that wave hit the Clark, there was some kind of surge, right off the scale, but now it's back to its previous levels.
Maybe one of the original crew?
To what? What are you saying? This ship is alive?
What I want is to survive the next ten hours.
Nine hours and twenty-two minutes.
Weir can't be alive.
I'll do it --
Dr. Weir, what's this the door to?
About an hour ago. In medical. I saw my son. He was lying on one of the examination tables and his legs were... 
He's engaged the override.
The safety circuit's failed!
You can't do that.
This is U.S. Aerospace Command vessel Lewis and Clark, hailing Event Horizon, Event Horizon, do you read...? This is the Lewis and Clark, hailing... 
Range 500 meters and holding. Turbulence is dropping off...
Explosive decompression.
Relativity, yes. We can't break the law of relativity, but we can go around it. The ship doesn't really move faster than the speed of light; it creates a dimensional gateway that allows the ship to instantaneously "jump" from one point in the universe to another, light years away.
What is it?
What is it?
Claire is your wife?
It must be hard, being so far away from her.
Where is Reed?
I'm worried about you.
What do you want, Vic?
I can't take this.
Maybe you should think about yourself for once. You always let this guy push you round --
Reed. Even you can't compute every little thing.
Are you alright?
What the --!
The machine works. And Vic's gone Mister Hyde on us --
What?
Yeah, for the last time, I hope. I'm done with this freak show. I'm moving back to the real world.
They're ready for you, sir.
Yes sir. You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
Those solar winds are flaring, but I factored them into my coordinates and --
As far as crew, I was hoping Ben could pilot the mission --
Feeling better?
I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship --
Which was?
What? What do you mean you --
I'm saying, if you had a little more self control, you could locate the trigger. Can you remember the exact emotions when --
If we can build a machine to re-create the storm, we can reverse the polarity --
Reed. How close are we to a cure?
Got it. So take a walk, Ben... I'm going to borrow Susan for a second.
Abort? Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will not let you make me look like a fool --
Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --
Raising the shields.
Victor, I'm sorry I --
How much did they cost?
If you'd apologize I think Dennis would take you back.
I can't find it, mon!
Easy, mon.
Well, that's not the way it works, really. And you ate most of your food already, too...
Your friends use the pool. Your friends messed it up.
I'm just guessing.
Maybe yes. Maybe no.
I can't wait until I can drive next year. I walk every day. It's such a drag.
Sometimes I get a ride with my brother. But he usually works in the mornings, and then drives to school himself.
Listen. I feel pretty strange here. Because Mark really likes you, and he's my friend.
I didn't see you this morning.
Look, I'm kind of in a hurry.
What's going on?
All right. All right. I just cleaned B-8. Give me a break.
Did you get her number?
I hear they all dress like that at Lincoln now.
Did you go home and get it?
Damone, are you there?
I come for the seafood. It's great! Hey... you know what, Mark? I found your wallet the other day. You want it back?
Hey fuck you Damone. There's a lot of girls out there and you mess around with Stacy. What have you got to prove?
Jesus. I'm sorry.
How often do you go?
Suzanne Somers' tits.
What the fuck is this guy doing?
My brother's car!
Just be glad you're all right.
That's him! He did it!
How's it going.
Should we buy a frame for that?
Linda. That girl looks just like Pat Benatar.
Yeah but they look more sophisticated. You'd probably think they'd be better in bed.
So tell me, do you like Ron? Is it serious?
Does Doug care that you're seventeen?
Doug sees beyond that stuff to what the person inside is like. That's why I'm marrying him.
If he ever calls again I'll say I'm eighteen.
Climax together.
I'm not going to tell him. He's an asshole. I hate him.
You just ripped my card in two!
Hey! Wait a minute! There's no birthday party for me here!
You better save some for me, you swine!
Mr... Mr. Hand.
I don't know. I guess so.
Now, Mr. Spicoli, comes a rare moment for me. Now I have the unique pleasure of squaring our account. Tonight, you and I are going to talk in great detail about the Davis Agreement, all the associated treaties, and the American Revolution in particular. Now if you can just turn to Chapter 47 of Lord of Truth And Liberty.
Where do you feel like going?
How about the point?
We keep them.
Yeah. She is pretty good.
Do you know what you want?
Really?
Well... the manager, Mr. Heem, would like to meet him. Nothing unusual. Mr. Heem likes to meet all our large accounts... put them on a personal basis... just a chat and a handshake, you understand.
Don't worry about a thing, sir. Just enjoy your stay.
Killed?
IN VIETNAM! ON THE GODDAMN TELEVISION!
They're everywhere. Nobody's safe. And sure as hell not in the South. They like warm weather... You'd never believe it. In L.A. it's out of control. First it was drugs, now it's witchcraft.
I'm a whiskey man myself. We don't have much trouble from drugs where I come from...
Yeh. The big guy used to be a major in the Marines.
If so -- well, we'll just have to cut his head off and bury him somewhere. Because it goes without saying that we can't turn him loose. He'd report us at once to some kind of outback Nazi law enforcement agency, and they'll run us down like dogs...
Jesus! Did I say that?
God hell! I think I see the pattern! This one sounds like real trouble! You're going to need plenty of legal advice before this thing is over. As your attorney I must advise you that you'll need a very fast car with no top and after that, the cocaine. And then the tape recorder, for special music, and some Acapulco shirts...  This blows my weekend, because naturally I'll have to go with you -- and we'll have to arm ourselves.
You scurvy shyster bastard! Watch your language! You're talking to a Doctor of Journalism!
God didn't do that! You did it! You're a fucking narcotics agent, that was our cocaine, you pig!
You better be careful. Plenty of vultures out here. They'll pick your bones clean before morning.
What are you talking about?
Why?
Yeah... I thought we might need it...
Let's go up there and blast him out of bed with the fire hose.
No, we should leave the poor bastard alone. I get the feeling that he's avoiding us for some reason.
You degenerate pig!
Like big lizards.
Lucy is looking for you.
Me?
No! I can't get out! They'll crucify me. I'll have to take the blame!
We should go! We should go right now!
Who the hell would you call?
Stop it.
They're right here.
Jesus Christ, I'm gonna have a stroke.
I'm gonna shoot him if they don't get him first.
Ohhh.
What now, Geronimo?
I'm in.
Wait, before you do that, help me to the kitchen, I need to lay down. There's a cot back there.
How much you got?
Jesus Christ on the cross... Someone make sense.
Two.
Seven.
What!? So you can just get the hell outta here and forget about all of us!? No way! That's my god damn truck!
What's that!? Wha'cha say? Huh?
This one will just stun ya, but this one will put ya to sleep.
Got 'cha!
What?!
Move slow and move quiet.
Where the hell are we going to go then, Billy Jack!?
You don't want the rag to touch the booze, that way you can hold it awhile and ensure it explodes when you throw it.
Nothin' will happen to you. You get on my back, hold on tight and we truck out of here together.
Okay, well... anybody else have an idea?
Yeah, I'll go.
Okay, well that's something.
Let's go!
Oh my God... What is that?
Her name is Charlie.
I'll do anything to help.
You know that no one likes a liar, right?
Frances?  Oh no.
I'm sure it wasn't me, it wasn't me...
Frances Farmer, contract player, six- month option.
That's Frances. I'm not the cookbook.
Hi Frances, got a minute?
He's not here.
Get your clothes on.
You learn your lines?
No.
Bye, baby.
It's already started, Dad... with me.
Of course.
Dad, here! You don't have to stop, just slow down. You can tell Mama I jumped out. She knows that's the kind of thing I'd do. She won't blame you.
You know where you're taking me. You know what she'll do. Just give me a minute, slow down, give me an instant for once in your life, please?
Oh, Angela! Go with these trappers! They'll lead you safely down the mountain...
You can always come see it in London.
You know, my old man was an inventor. Spent his whole life down in the basement trying to design transcontinental underground railroads, stuff like that. Well, I was supposed to be his partner. When I told him the smell of his workshop made me sick, I thought he was going to die right there.
Sure. Try this acting thing. You can make good money at it.
You don't know what you want.
Yeah, I read about that. Terrible business, suicide.
Yeah.
Shit. I meant the other way around.
You're telling me.
Dick... and my mother! She acts like she's on Mars or something --
He deserves a show. He missed the movie.
Think I'll have a glass.
What for?
Yeah, and you look at people and you wonder who the hell they are, what's going on inside their heads. Sometimes you can hear it, like a buzzing, the things that happen in their heads. And you wonder: does anybody ever love anybody, really?
I should've known...
What?
I don't think I'd be much good in a war...
Huh?
I guess.
What's that?
It's not too late to keep going, up to Vancouver? Be the smartest thing.
Where to?
Been a lot of years, you know. A long time waiting. For what? End up feeling like a sap.
Oh please, Harry... don't even think it. You're the only person who ever... It's just... Can't you wait for me?
Sure I did, that's why I'm here.
Yeah. Yeah, I heard about that.
It's going to be slow from now on. Do you know what I mean, Harry?
Goodbye, Harry. It was very good to see you again.
Pretty morning.
Yeah.
Answer the question! Have you driven a car since you were placed on probation?
I never saw him. Why didn't he show up?
Miss Farmer, is it true you fought with the policeman who arrested you last night?
But I want to. I'm trying!
It isn't in your hands, Mama. It's my life.
You kill me, Mama.
I think I need a little air.
What's wrong?
No!
Of course, she hasn't anything definite in mind.
I find these initial meetings to be much easier without the concerned relatives in attendance.
I'm glad to see you haven't lost your sense of humor.
I see.
All right. Will you please sit down now?  Symington says.
Just a little joke, Miss Farmer.
Not at all. She brought me my fan mail.  I had no idea there were so many strangers concerned about me. But I guess that's the best thing about working in the movies. You make so many friends. I want to go back and show them that the faith they put in me wasn't a mistake.
Dr. Symington, how big is your dick?
No! No!
And he drove me to mine.
Come warm yourself if you like.
Kill you? Hardly that.
Evil?  Do you believe in evil?
What can I do?
There is something I want.  A friend.
Friend?
Elizabeth, really! He's quite mad!
Scandalous! What would your dear mother say?
Something's wrong. I know it.  I've heard rumors of cholera spreading south from Hamburg.
What kind of God is He to will this?
Victor, have a care! You'll make him dizzy!
And you?
You will.  What do you want, Victor?
Victor. I love you,
If what you say is true, it is a matter for the police!
What of our marriage? Victor, we've had so much tragedy. I want this family to live again.
No. Not tomorrow, not next week, Marry me today.
Captain, I implore you. The men are frightened and angry. They want your assurance.
Do you really think I'm mad?
Victor. This has got to stop.  Nobody's seen you in months. You haven't attended a single class.
Listen to what I'm saying. The militia's arriving to quarantine the city. Most of us are getting out while we still can.
Is that your diagnosis?
You've been going round-the-clock?
No. They don't.
Victor, explain yourself.
Why? God alone knows what it means. Until it has proven value, it's nothing more than a ghoulish parlor trick. Hardly fit for the classroom.
I heard.
It will be all right. I'll take care of you.
You draw very well.
Next Friday.
Steve said for you to start on the boats.
Oh, my God...
What'll you do when you leave here?
It wouldn't matter except Steve should be getting back pretty soon. It wouldn't look so great if he fell over them.
It sounded like Brenda.
Where?
It's dead. Try the pay phone.
Do you have a dime? A quarter?
I'll be okay. Holy shit...
You ever fire one of those bows again, and I'll tack you up on the wall to dry.
I love you.
I don't love Neddy.
Don't call him.
No, thanks. I'm fine. Sandy.
One night on the town.
Yeah. I got it on before this --  -- all started.
Have to drop you here, Steve.
Another coincidence.
You said it was just you and your son.
Why the fuck, outta all the god forsaken shit holes in Mexico, did you have us rendezvous at that place?
Yeah, follow us.
What about Kate?
Neither does he. He looks Vietnamese.
Where are the keys to the motor home?
Come again?
Jacob Fuller. Jacob, that's biblical, ain't it? What am I askin' for, of course it is.  What are their names?
My wife.
Auto wreck.
Didn't think so. So, as I was saying, I'm willing to make a deal. You behave, get us into Mexico, and don't try to escape. I'll keep my brother off your daughter and let you all loose in the morning.
If he touches her, I'll kill him. I don't give a fuck how many guns you have, nothing will stop me from killing him.
I don't have the slightest idea.
We did our part, we gotcha in Mexico. Now it's time for your part, letting us go.
Who else?
Pass.
What did you call me?
You too, preacher?
What do you think Mom would say?
It's a flop house.
It's not a flop house. It's basic and simple. That doesn't make it a flop house.
It has a bed. That's all I care about.
About two hours from now.
I promise.
Kate, we don't have all day, so I'm only gonna count to five. One...two... three... four...
What?
What's in Mexico?
You got three minutes. One second longer, I shoot your father in the face. Do you understand what I just said?
Yes.
You must have a bible in here, don't cha?
How many bullets left, kid?
-- you got your sink --
Hot goddamn day!
Haven't felt it a bit. Been inside with the air conditioner blastin' all day long.
You could sue the shit out of her, ya know. That kid belongs under a circus tent, not flippin' burgers. You could own that fuckin' place.
Were you giving that pig signals?
Yeah?
Gotcha!
Do they have cable?
Do they have an X-rated channel?
Did you even to try to negotiate?
Is it me? Is it my fault?
Is this my fault? Do you think this is what I am?
Yes, you did. You said as long as I don't act like a fuckin' nut, implying that I've been acting like a fuckin' nut.
I'm curious. What was the nuttiest thing I did?
I don't know, you just passed out.
What do you mean?
I'm here with you.
No, you're not. You're sippin' margaritas in El Ray. But we're not in El Ray. We're here -- getting ready to go in there. You're so pleased with yourself about getting into Mexico, you think the job's down. It ain't. Get back on the clock. That's a fuck-with-you-bar. We hang around there for a coupla hours, in all likelihood, we'll get fucked with. So get your shit together, brother.
They take you away to San Clemente Island.  Half the guys quit when they come back.  Supposed to be just hell-and-a-half.
I've been accused of that wish.
Wow...
Commander, are you of the habit of letting photographers traipse around your base snappin' their fill? These were supposed to have been discreet test cases --
Well, seein's how this thing is out, you let me handle the r.p.m.  From this point forward, I want all press matters coordinated via my office. I'll be god-damned if I'm gonna watch Hayes pull flowers out of his ass and take credit for this one. Him or the President.  This my shade?  "Midnight Mahogany"? 'Cuz I'm comin' dangerously close to lookin' like Ronald Reagan here.
Thank you, sir.
It's you, sir.  And it started the day I came here.
Same rules for everyone, sir.
So I'll get a fair shot?
Permission to leave, sir?
Sir.  If tomorrow... I was not under your command... would the inquiry still go forward?
I'm not sure what --
Think I overplayed it?
"The Lark Report."
Yes, I see your signature right here -- twice the size of everyone else's.  And your conclusion was "pilot error," hmm?
You know him.
It should.  You nominated him for Spec-Recon just three days after you nominated me.
I'd go Special Reconnaissance. Every bit as tough -- and we have a 60 percent drop-out rate among the men.
Really don't wanna be captured, el- tee.  Heard some bad things.
Six o'clock!  Marking, marking!
Come on, Montgomery...
Miller.  Thought the guy was made of depleted uranium.  Really didn't expect to lose him.
Boat Five -- Wickwire, Cozad, Vinyl, Intagliata, Ayers, and Wise. Lieutenant Wickwire is your senior officer.  Follow his orders to your death.
Probably hear back from CNN first.
Well, you're doin' shit-hot at Intel.
Big symbols make big targets, Jordan.  I think someone's gunning for you.
"In Washington..."
I didn't know they let you try again.  Especially at your age.
So the shit you gotta go through? To get from here to there?  Brother said it was worth it.  Worth the training... worth the divorce... worth anything.
Last time I didn't.
Females in combat situations impact unit cohesion.  Men fight better without women around.  And that is an historical fact.
McCool's that same rank.  We're both j.g.'s.
That's what your crew said.  Are they lying?  Or are you?
Darth Vader reads poetry...
You mind?  I'm trying to eat here.
All right.  So who stands to gain if Jordan flames out in a big way?
The first female President?
If you were the President, wouldn't that put a little piss in your shoes?
Even tough I don't talk to her every day -- I still talk to her every day.  Know what I mean?
Shut up. How can you eat like that?
I'm telling you he's dirt. He's a douche bag, gutter slime, dog crap, puke chunks...
What? I just couldn't just let them sleep in the street.
Think we can fit up in there?
Cut uptown, take 8th to 57th then cut up Broadway.
You're crazy, go to the east side and take the park avenue to the JFK.
No, I'm into earthworms now. You wouldn't be interested. They're real "boring" creatures. Very reliable, dependable, no surprises...
Wait. I'm sorry. You're right. Eight years is a long time. Can I offer you a cup of tea?
Are you okay?
My life sucks.
Yeah, well he just turned up in New Jersey at the military command post. Somehow all this is related to what happened down in Panama. There's a story here. I know it. You got any tape or glue?
Five bucks.
Just tell me, did you talk with him?
Oh, I'm not married.
Do you know that you just interrupted a three year study of the Chernobyl earthworm?
Seventeen percent, huh? Sounds big.
That's right.
So after we kill the creature we'll begin a search for the nest.
Last time you didn't even scratch it!
It is my job to protect my country. Sometimes I must even protect it from itself. From mistakes we have made. Mistakes that we do not want the world to know about.
How do I do that?
I understand.
I just wanted to say, au revoir and thank you for your help, my friend.
This is it?
Sir, it's you  Thank Ipthar!
Okay, Quellek, let's get back to the command deck and-Suddenly we hear a PISTOL BLAST and Quellek's chest turns RED. Alexander and Quellek look down at the blood, horrified.
"The show must go on."
At ease men.
You don't hold a thruster down! It's for quick boosts
DON'T BE INSANE, STOP! FULL STOP!
What's the scale?  Is that ten miles? A hundred miles?
There it is. The Beryllium sphere.
Jason, before we entered the black hole, my instruments detected strange energy surge from Sarris' shiD~ similar to...
He's a twit!
What's happened?
Oh good, there's nothing to eat.
Oh my god, It's real.
We heard it the first time!
"Go into the cloud! ...
He knocked me out the sonofabitch. Where is he?
You said "the Commander.
Back there. You said "the Commander is down there with a bunch of cannibals."
You've got the utility systems walkthrough, right?
Yes but, we were wondering-
It's real, Brandon. All of it, It's real.
Yes?
Never mind, Fred....
How do you remember this stuff?
...The digital conveyor.
We've got to get that valve turned off. Their oxygen Is almost gone...
Guy, you HAVE a last name. We just don't KNOW it.
...Okay
Your last name.
~e're alive!
What?
Only answers to me.
Wait. When are you going to tell them?
All right... here's the plan:  First, Fred, we need a diversion to clear those things out of the compound, then Gwen, Alex, Fred and I go down to get the sphere.  Any of those things come back, give a signal. Guy, you set up a perimeter.
How does the rolling help, actually?
Because it was on the show!
That's it, It's go time.
My name is Jason Nesmith. I'm an actor. We're all actors.
Commander... Welcome to the Protector II.  Would you like to don your uniform?
Then how did he find out about the device?
You said we do appearances together, or not at all.'
How about the pig-lizard?
Because they're coming right at us.
We're in bad shape, Benedict, moral is low.  Before I can do anything, I need Lee and his seven thousand troops.  I've ordered him to join us three times.  In my last letter I all but begged him to come here. The man is insubordinate.
Congress is talking -- openly -- about replacing you with Lee.
No.  I guess.
Yes, my lord.
What the goddamned hell do you think you are doing!?
Excuse me, General, but may I ask how do you feel?
I'm so inclined.
That young school teacher... I heard the British hung him as a spy.
I'm not sure.
Of course the army will acquit him, that's not the point... Arnold is a man and will understand.  What I need to understand is, John, Sam... what is happening here?  Who are those people in there?  The fat ones in silk?
Gentlemen, let me get to the point, I can't see the wisdom of pursuing this old court-martial against General Arnold.
We have more officers created by Congress than we know what to do with.
Gentlemen, my I introduce a French gentleman, recently appointed major general by Congress...  Marie Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette. General Lafayette has brought us the greetings and goodwill of his countrymen, and... how many cases of muskets, Mon petite Marquis?
Surely you knew this was coming.
The day Tom Jefferson frees a slave I'll ride naked through the streets of Williamsburg on a mule.  Tom Jefferson is one of those people who talks big and acts small.  The only man out there who really does what he says is Sam Adams and everyone thinks he's crazy.  Believe me, this 'disturbance' isn't going to last long.  You have to understand, congress is a chicken coop full of foxes, Martha, each and every one has his eye on a nice, fat prize.
"Liberty, Virtue, Country"... That's from Cato... you know, that play about the noble Romans?  As I was riding up to Philadelphia, I found myself thinking about the old days...
To win this war I need an army.
I want you to see our hospital.
We can't take them.  Are you all right?
It isn't my army yet, Colonel Greene.  Looks like you've seen some action -- did you hurt your leg, in a fight?
General Greene?
Nathanael, I'm sending you to Virginia to head the southern army, to harass Cornwallis.  Marquis, you must go with him.
And what is this, then?  Been off to fight the French because you are a patriot?  Or is this you, gaining your long sought after rise in society by becoming victorious in war!?
Really?  Which precious homily was it?
Cranes?  Who needs to walk like a crane?
I see...
That?  I hear a mob:  unemployed, drunkards, vagabonds... the world's dregs.
Juba was a Numidian.
William, we've been studying hard, I really know my stuff.
I seen it, but I don't believe it. Says Harry shot Ronnie five times. Four to the chest and one through his foot.
Who?
Your who?
I put a gun right here...  ...and I tell him, 'Sign the paper Marty or your fuckin' dead.' Like that.
Harvey Keitel. Yeah. Maybe. He was pretty good in the movie "Fingers".
Yeah, Morgan Freeman. But he's a colored guy.
I really think I can be of service on this one.
What, you gonna shoot me now, Bo?
In just a second. Two...
I'm at 8150 Wonderland Avenue. It's right off Laurel.
You broke in my house and I have a witness to it.
Only this time, no John Wayne and Dean Martin shooting the bad guys in El Dorado.
You get to town, you go straight to the bank, raid the limo account.
Ray Barboni. From Miami.
That's right.
Anyway, you want this guy, he's in L.A. We put him on a flight after he spanked one a my cocktail girls in the Keno room.
Guy owes us a hundred and fifty grand, sixty days over; a movie producer.
I'm looking at you.
I know what a marker is.
You're not looking at me, Harry.
You gonna get rough now, threaten me? I make good by tomorrow or get my legs broken?
You want to hear this idea? It's about a dry cleaner who scams an airline out of three hundred grand. Go on, tell her.
So he comes to L.A...
Wait a minute, you're not the guy, are you? The dry cleaner?
Maybe a few times I have.
Ever shot anybody.
Once.
You got that on the brain, Harry. If you're so scared of 'em why'd you take their money to Vegas to begin with?
A blockbuster. But quality. No mutants or maniacs. This one's gonna be my "Driving Miss Daisy".
Anyway, Murray has this shrink, who also happens to be Martin's personal trainer's shrink. Murray gives the shrink the script and the shrink gives it to Martin's trainer who reads it to Martin while they work out, and Martin flips. Loves it.
Doris, Murray's widow, finds out about this Martin Weir thing and says since Murray and I never had any written contract, she wants five hundred grand for the script.
Lovejoy sits behind the wheel, watching the bar across the street, getting his video camera ready for action...  What's he doing? Following a guy?
That's the difference between you and me, Harry. I say what I mean. I want something from someone, I ask 'em straight out. I want Martin Weir, I go get Martin Weir. I don't fuck around with his trainer's shrink.
Forget about Leo's money, Harry.
Who?
Ray Barboni. Guy from Miami, owns Leo now that Momo died.
Who the fuck is Momo? Jesus, these fucking names...
A few weeks before shooting, I went back to Bensonhurst, just to listen to you guys. See, I'm Italian, but I grew up in Tarzana. So I wanted to pick up your rhythms of speech.
What happened? The pressure got to you?
It's not one of these?
What're you doing here?
Yeah, well make sure you lock it on the way out.
Yeah... that was a good scene. I mean, for a horror movie.
Well, I gotta have a talk with Leo, my runaway dry cleaner.
I was never much into it. All that bullshit having to do with respect. It's bad enough having to treat those guys like they're your heroes, having to smile when they make some stupid remark they think's real funny.
And you think the movie business is any different?
This thing's actually accurate. I bought it for ten bucks from a kid in a lawn chair on Sunset...
Yeah?
Yeah. There's a girl in it now.
You thought I was faking?
What took you so long?
Whatta you doing out there?
I'm going into the movie business.
What're you talking about? You wanna be a movie star?
Whatta you mean, whose point of view; The audience's point of view.
That's great, Harry. So what's the --
Well, aren't you gonna offer me whatever it is you taste like?
You seem to feel fine about it.
Harry -–
What I'm saying, Harry, is I want you and your new buddy to get out of my house.
Lufkin. His... agent.
North Island, I wish to declare myself salvor-in-posession under section four two charlie of the International Maritime Convention.
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. Please advise your salvage authority pending registry check. Over.
North Island, have you got any additional information? Over.
Fucker!
Let's not be too hasty.
I need lag bolts, especially one inch standard. And sheet metal. Preferably steel, about a sixteenth of an inch. Aluminium, even tin'll do.
You think that's funny
If this thing turns out to be a ship everybody thought sank a long time ago, we just hit the jackpot.
One guy isn't gonna be so stupid.
A what?
What say, Epps? You up for some roasted albatross?
You have any idea how much a ship like that could be worth in salvage? The fittings alone could go for a few million.
With a little extra fuel, weather permitting, we should make Sitka in five days without another stop.
How long to fix?
Metal's crystallized. Gotta replace the whole deal.
Went aboard.
Didn't happen yesterday, I'll tell you that. Torn parts rusted bad as the rest of the boat.
Do what you need to do. Just do it fast.
On a passenger ship in 1953?
What do you propose?
I don't know what you're talking about?
You smashed it!
What's slow?
Show your tatoos to that coxswain last night, did you Epps?
What'd he look like?
Any dizziness?
The law's on our side. If they want to challenge it, let them try.
You're saying they mutinied for the gold?
If they were close enough to shore, they probably figured they could get away in the lifeboats.
The what?
Not our mystery guest again.
Maybe hallucination is the wrong word. It was more than that. As though they were showing me.
Maybe it was one of them did the handy work on those Greeks.
Could be a stroke. Who knows?  The general log said the crew were fighting among themselves. "Like wild dogs."
We hit land.
Too deep to anchor out there.
We're not gonna be able to pump it!
A what?
He took the shotgun and a light.
As I said, what seems to be the trouble?
No, no. You got leak.
Have you seen my blue spatula?
Hi.  Look, I'm kind of tired - I think I'll go to bed.
What?
Are you going to yell at me?
Actually, I was just checking to see if you were here - your friend Seymour is on his way up.
What's wrong with you?! Tell him I'm not here!
But I can't --
Well, I got the idea when I was doing some research and I discovered that Cook's Chicken used to be called Coon's Chicken, and so I decided to do my project based on this discovery as kind of a comment on racism... and the way racism is whitewashed over in our culture...
And how do you think this addresses the subject of racism?
It's complicated... I guess I'm trying to show how racism used to -- more out in the open and now it's hidden, or something...
Don't worry - it's nothing bad. I was just wondering what your plans were for next year?
As far as I know it includes housing and meals and everything... it is really quite an offer...
What are you doing? You don't ever criticize the feature!
Then why do you hate me so much?
When did I say I hated you?
I know, I liked her better when she was an alcoholic crack addict! She gets in one car wreck and all of a sudden she's Little Miss Perfect and everybody loves her.
What?
Remember that stupid hippie art teacher who failed me sophomore year? I didn't think that just because you get an "F" that means you have to take the class over again.
So, when are we going to start looking for our apartment?
Much later.
You know, sacrifice virgins and stuff...
Maybe they're slowly poisoning us or they're planning to brainwash us and --
Okay, okay!
"Authentic 50's diner"? Since when were there mini-malls in the 1950's?
There's my dad with Joanie.
Which loser?
I know, look at the way he drives... he's like an old man.
I want to "make love" to him.
Not really...
Let's go hassle Josh.
Waiting for the bus that never comes...
It's not like I'm some modern Punk dickhead... It's obviously supposed to be a 1977 Punk look, but I guess Johnny Fuckface is too stupid to get it!
I didn't get it either.
Let's get out of here, this place makes me sick.
I'm working on it... I've got a few leads... it's just that right now I have, all these projects that take up all my time.
Are you kidding? It's a dream job! I can't believe you got a job like that without even trying... God, I wish that was my job...
When are you finally going to get your diploma?
I remember our big plan was as soon as we got the apartment we were going to trick Daniel Dusentrieb into coming over and then fuck him.
Fuck it. Everything must go!
No, really...
I can't believe it - he actually scored!
When was this?
It's fine.
What time?
We're not.
Oh yeah, that'll definitely happen...
My acting workshop is across the street from here. I'm just on my break.
A mongoose... they eat snakes... you never heard of a mongoose?  That's a classic piece of vintage taxidermy. Nobody alive today knows how to do work like that.
How much is this?
Oh, how "punk."
Fine, and how are you?
Hey, where are you going?
What?
Do you have any old Indian records?
Those are all 78s... Can you play 78s?
The Skip James record? Yeah, that's a masterpiece. There are no other records like that! I actually have the original 78 of it in my collection. It's one of maybe five known copies.
You're right about that.  So this is your record collection?
Mark my words, by the end of this summer you'll be up to your neck in pussy!
What about her? Would you go out with her?
Look at this -- "Lollipop Lolitas" - isn't child pornography totally illegal?
Uh, I don't have much money with me right now.
I told her you were a big record executive and you were thinking of signing that band to your label.
What the fuck, Seymour?! What is this?
What are you, a fry cook or something?
Hey, can I borrow this?
What is that?
I mean, I'm eighteen years old and I've never even had a real, steady boyfriend for more than like two weeks!
Really?
Uh yeah. A long time ago... she called before once... it's just somebody trying to humiliate me.
Hi, it's me...
So, what happened?
Sort of... she doesn't dislike any of that stuff... she's trying, anyway... actually, we're supposed to go antique shopping for her apartment this afternoon...
Uh... sure... come in.
Uh... I think there's some root beer...
I'm just being realistic.
At least you're not like every other stupid guy in the world - all they care about are guitars and sports... they're all such fags!
I mean... of course I... why wouldn't I want to go out with you?
...Maybe I should just move in here with you... I could do all the cooking and dust your record collection and stuff until I get a job.
I guess I probably used to when I was your age.
So what's the story with the two cheerleaders over here?
Talk to us about it...
Right, exactly!
I don't know... where is she, then?
Seymour?
-oh, sing a different song, Abdullah-  -there's nothing wrong with your men so stop telling me there is-
My wife is the game player in the family, sir.
I do need to see Starling.
It's what the natives are calling the lions-  -two lions have been causing trouble-
-then he feasted on him, starting with his feet-
I have been desperate for Patterson to let me move the hospital since the day he arrived.
Tell me about Beaumont- does he understand how brilliant you are, how lucky he is to have you?
Oh dear-  -you're geting that downtrodden look again-
Not once?- you didn't hit it once?-
Beaumont says it's to end slavery.
Might be exciting for you.
John, it will not be easy.
What a good week.
Actually, no.
That's very considerate.
Has it ever done that before?
Meant to ask you- the railroad car trap. Your idea?  Excellent notion- I used the same device myself once.
What happened to them?
It's certainly the best chance they've had to kill you.
You like him, don't you?
Some mysteries should not have solutions.
You know, you are really doing very good work here.  I think soon you may be ready to assist me in some of the more important restorations.
We'll be very sorry to lose you.  Perhaps I could take you to lunch today?
Okay, just thought I'd check.  Good night, Dana.  Sleep well.  Don't let the bedbugs bite you.
If this is what the world will be like, I don't want to live in it.
Everybody has a choice.
Not in this case, my dear.  Take a look. That's not Gainsborough's Blue Boy up there. He's Vigo!
Time is running out, Dana.  Soon it will be midnight and the city will be mine -- and Vigo's.  Well, mainly Vigo's.  But we have a spectacular opportunity to make the best of our relationship.
Certainly.
Egon, I'd rather you didn't mention any of this to Peter if you don't mind.
I won't.
Thank you, Frank.  Oh, are you ever going to fix the radiator in my bedroom?  I asked you last week.
I'm El Gato.  I always land on my feet.
So this is what you do, huh?
This is Joe Namath's old number, you know. You could get a lot of chicks with this. Just don't pee in it.
Really?  And how would we handle the sleeping arrangements?
It's Janine Melnitz, from my staff.  She's one of my most valuable employees.
Does that start exactly at midnight tomorrow, or could you hold off for a few days maybe?
For one night in your life, do you think it's possible for us to be completely real?
I think we hit the honeypot, boys.  There's something brewing under the street.
That's quite a story.
Who are you going to call?
What are you doing up here?
Have you made any plans yet?  You know tomorrow is New Year's Eve.
So these dwarfs had a limited partnership in a small mining operation and then one day a beautiful princess came to live with them.
It's a painting I'm restoring for the new Byzantine exhibition.  It's a self-portrait of Prince Vigo, the Carpathian.  He ruled most of Carpathia and Moldavia in the 17th Century.
Too bad for the Moldavians.
I await the word of Vigo.
Lord Vigo, the mother, Dana, is fine and strong.  I was wondering -- well, would it be possible -- if I bring the baby, could I have the woman?
Keep that up, mister, and I'll find you in contempt.
Okay, so can you tell us when it's going to happen or do we have to buy the book?
So, Dr. Venkman, please explain to the court why it is you and your co-defendants took it upon yourselves to dig a big hole in the middle of the street.
Boys, listen.  You're scaring the straights. Let's save this until tomorrow, okay?
They came from Ostrov in Eastern Poland.
It won't work.  There's no way we could generate enough positive energy to crack that shell.
Oh, just checking something for an old friend.
Who?
Who, Ray?
Well, Holmes, what do you think?
What kind of tests?
Did you find anything at Dana's?
I don't think they make Nikes in her size.
I'm ready.
Yeah, what did we do, Ray?  The last real job we had we bubbled up a hundred foot marshmallow man and blew the top three floors off an uptown highrise.
What?  Yeah.
No, I just thought --
Ray -- Ray -- How do you feel, man?
Kind of makes you wonder, doesn't it?
To the bathroom, where do you think?
Hey, sweetheart, will you CUT THAT OUT!!!
Do you think I have it, Dr. Venkman?
Eight o'clock?
Okay.  I'll take a raincheck.  I always have plenty of mineral water and other nutritious health foods, but you know that.  Listen, that reminds me, I'm having a party for all my clients.  It's gonna be my fourth anniversary as an accountant.  I know you fill out your own tax return, but I'd like you to come being that you're my next door neighbor and all ...
Hey, it's crazy in here.  You're missing a classic party.
Great!  Bring her, too.  But you better hurry.  I made nachos with non-fat cheese and they're almost gone.  I'll make some more though.
On a purely scientific basis.
Can't you tell me now?
What's that got to do with it?
Did you see it?  What was it?
Yes, it would.
Well, because I'm curious.  I want to know more about what you do here.  Frankly, there have been a lot of wild stories in the media and we want to assess any possible environmental impact from your operation. For instance, the storage of noxious, possibly hazardous waste materials in your basement.  Now either you show me what's down there or I come back with a court order.
Hey!  I'm getting a little tired of this.
Were you recently in the bathroom?
Spengler, are you serious about actually catching a ghost?
Generally, you don't see that kind of behavior in a major appliance.  What do you think, Egon?
Don't cross the beams.
Why not?
What is it?
Yeah, yeah.  I was just thinking.  It probably wouldn't be a good idea for them to get together at this point.
Yes.  After the First World War Shandor decided that society was too sick to survive.  And he wasn't alone.  He had close to a thousand followers when he died.  They conducted rituals, bizarre rituals, intended to bring about the end of the world.
She said he was "the Destructor."
You talked to Gozer?
Look at the structure of the roof cap.  It looks exactly like the kind of telemetry tracker NASA uses to identify dead pulsars in other galaxies.
What do we do now?
I don't know.  Talk to it.
This is like a major disgrace.  Forget M.I.T. or Stanford now ... they wouldn't touch us with a three-meter cattle prod.
You're always so worried about your reputation.  We don't need the University. Einstein did his best stuff while he was working as a patent clerk.'They can't stop progress.
I'm getting high readings near the air vents.  It must be using the duct system to get around.  See, I told you we'd get something.
Third floor.  Get down here,
Egon, how's the grid around the storage facility holding up?
The Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man!  He was on all the packages we used to buy when I was a kid.  We used to roast Stay-Puft marshmallows at Camp Waconda!
No.  But I liked Jesus' style.
And the seas would boil ...
Right.  And the sky would fall ...
Don't you think you should at least wave?
Why are you so surly -- you've won, brother.  The people have bread and the city is quiet.
What is that... wailing?
Yes?  Go on!
I want that bastard dead!
Caesar?
I'm ordering a general stand-down in preparation for withdrawal back across the Danube.
Forgive me, Caesar, but do two Senator represent the mood of the whole Senate or the will of the Roman people?  Besides, every truce we make with the Germans they break!
Caesar, let me sponsor your first wager in the arena.
The Emperor and I are bound by the threads of The Fates.  He was born on August thirty-first, you know.
God of passages and changes?
The Senate too?
Would you support the Senate if they would give you a trial?  You'd have to give me your word.
I need to give you my word when yours is worth nothing?
Fools to let us both live; we'll be our own best witnesses at our trial.
You know our two most senior Senators:  Gaius Cantus and Falco Verus?
How do you know I am playing?  Well, the clown is always harmless.  Isn't that right?  And how did you ever get to know me so well?  The last we spent any time together I was fourteen.  I think you know me better than my father.  He's going to die, isn't he?
To think I brought my daughters up on all things Roman.  Read to sleep on Catullus, Lucretius... Virgil... every night.  My beautiful daughters.
I made the plume from a quail feather.
What the hell was all that about?
Why don't we try to keep politics out of the conversation.
You seem to be doing a great job of it single-hand!  Narcissus, the Republic is dead.  You think those Senators could govern?  For the last hundred and fifty years they've worked hard at kissing an endless succession of Imperial asses!
Very fancy.  Did you design the bottle?
I'm a soldier -- we're at war.  I can't stay home tending the damned olive groves?
Me?  Well, I believe in Rome... you'd have to after what I've seen, how people outside the empire treat each other.
Take your hands off me animal!
No more bad luck now!  The people are anticipating you!  I have posters up over half the city advertising you as the great warrior -- the true Roman!  The man who fought side by side with the wolf of Rome!
No.  Tell them I'll do it.  But I want more posters all over Rome.
Right, right, what am I thinking of?
You're living at home now. Is that right?
I want to go home.
But could you try?
No, I mean -- I wouldn't want to wake anyone up.
Listen, Elaine -- it seems to me that there isn't a bar in here. I mean -- as far as I know.
Benjamin --
And it's all over now.
Elaine --
No.
Benjamin -- you're -- I don't know what to say -- you're --
Is it because I'm here?
I said I think it is.
-- and when we got up in the room she starts taking her her clothes off -- and --
What are you going to do now?
Benjamin?
How about tomorrow? I don't mean to be pushy but --
Or this afternoon. It's a good day for it.
I just don't think it would work.
Why don't you just drag me off if you want to marry me so much?
Carl who?
Why do you have to see him?
How did he do it? Did he get down on his knees? He didn't get down on his knees, I hope.
Well, what did he say? I'm curious.
He said he thought we'd make a pretty good team.
Thank you.
Exactly how do you mean?
I like to know who's living in my house. I like to know what my boys are up to.
You're not one of those agitators?
Screaming isn't all right. Not in my house it isn't.
You heard me. Out of here.
I want you out of here.
I am going to call the police now.
Could I make one phone call first?
BENJAMIN?
Well here's the purse.
No. Now I know it's pretty late and if you'd rather --
Yes sir?
Luggage? Yes. Yes. I do.
Sir?
What?
What?
I want you to come in till I get the lights on.
Would you mind walking ahead of me to the sun porch. I feel funny about coming into a dark house.
Yes.
What do you think of me?
Sit down.
Benjamin -- you've known me all your life.
I don't see why. I'm twice as old as you are. How could anyone think --
Is that what you're trying to tell me?
How are you?
You don't have to be so nervous, you know.
Well -- goodbye then --
Mrs. Robinson -- I can't do this.
Oh no, Mrs. Robinson. I think -- I think you're the most attractive of all my parents' friends. I just don't think we could possibly --
How about art.
Art. That's a good subject. You start it off.
Then why do you want to talk about it?
No. Think of another topic. Tell me what you did today.
Yes I do.
Yes. But you might try and spice it up with a little originality.
How do you get out of the house?
Benjamin, this isn't a very interesting topic.
The driveway's on my side of the house.
Right.
No we don't.
On New Year's Eve. Sometimes on his birthday.
Is it?
Well I can't.
I can't see why you did, unless... you didn't have to marry him or anything, did you?
Oh no. You had to marry him because you got pregnant?
All right. Now let's get to bed.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. So how did it happen?
I mean do you feel like telling me what were the circumstances?
I'm curious.
We'd go to his car.
Oh my God.
Don't talk about Elaine?
Well, I'm not.
Because -- Mrs. Robinson this is the sickest, most perverted thing that ever happened to me. And you do what you want but I'm getting the hell out.
Are you?
It's not! I enjoy it! I look forward to it. It's the one thing I have to look forward to.
This is absurd.
Mrs. Robinson -- I have a date with Elaine. We're going for a drive.
Hello. Get me the police, please.
What have you done to her?
You can't stop me from seeing her, Mrs. Robinson. I'll find her.
Yes. Well -- goodnight.
I'm afraid I don't understand.
Why did you say that?
I do.
I'm going up to Berkeley today.
No -- they don't.
That has nothing to do with it --
Wait a minute. You talked to Elaine this morning?
She's upstairs. She wanted me to wait down here till you got home.
Standing guard over the old castle, are you?
Is anything wrong? You look a little shaken up.
That's a hell of a good age to be.
You'll never be young again.
Yes, sir.
I'd like to hear it.
That's quite a statement.
Listen to me. We got -- we got into bed with each other. But it was nothing. It was nothing at all. We might -- we might just as well have been shaking hands.
Hello.
They came all the way from Tarzana.
She's gone to the theatre -- don't you know?
Yes.
I have an idea working in my head... 
Have you seen it?
That.
Yes? -- Tomorrow?
Chasing around.
I thought that, too -- but I found that it does. Come along, dance with Kringelein.
Well -- such is life, Flaemmchen.
Nothing -- only to be here.
Why do you hide in my room?
No irony. You're so appealing -- so soft -- so tired. I feel like taking you in my arms and not letting anything more happen to you -- ever.
Strange man...
He disappeared. Later he was found dead.
No -- You don't want to be alone at all -- You were in despair before -- If I left you, you'd feel worse than you did before, You must not be alone -- You mustn't cry -- you must forget... Tell me that I can stay with you -- tell me.
Flix. -- And how do you live? What kind of a person are you?
I know.
So --
Grusinskaya --
For Vienna?
Why later?
You must go now. Be careful on your way to your room.
I'm worried about you.
Thank you, sir.
Permit me -- my name is Kringelein -- from Fredersdorf.
Then you know him?
A drink, Baron -- A Louisiana flip?
We could come to my room.
I take five hundred.
Oh -- yes -- that's it -- you found it -- you found it for me, Baron.
It's always so quiet here.
Pardon me, the lady has urgent business here with me.
I think it would be much better if you went away.
We shall see who remains here the longer.
The stenographer is to go up -- Mr. Preysing telephoned.
Madam Grusinskaya -- at once --
Man -- that's terrible. He was a nice fellow -- I am sorry about him.
No pain, Mr. Kringelein?
I had a very good opportunity, a young lady asked me to dance -- I ought to be able to dance, it seems to be very important.
Everything?
You are funny. You speak of life as if it were a train you wanted to catch.
No - absinthe.
Dance then? 
What?
What?
Skiing? 
Not too quickly.
My daughters -- yes, my daughters. 
Now, children, no fighting -- save that for the office. Let's have our dance. 
I couldn't do that, you're a stranger to me.
We are here to discuss our merger. Naturally I can make no statement at this time. We must begin at the beginning.
I'm laying before you the last general statement of our concern. Active capital, plant and machinery, raw material and finished product -- for instance -- mop rags --
You've decided against the merger?
If you actually have news from Manchester then...
You're a deep one.
Orchids come again, Madam -- no card -- I think perhaps they are from the same young man -- he is at the end of the corridor -- tall -- he walks like a soldier -- Madam must have noticed how often he is in the elevator with us. Last night for instance --
Why not?
I wish to be alone.
Certainly, sir.
I could not think of not accepting.
Some champagne, Miss Flaemm?
No -- no -- wait -- the man was a burglar -- he was going to steal my money.
Come, Lisaveta, he will be there -- he will be there.
I want to dictate my statement for tomorrow. I can't speak without notes. I like to have things down before me in black and white.
You must go to Manchester at once yourself and really see it through.
I can understand that -- after your -- uh --
Let's go down and find her -- I need a drink -- Come along Zinnowitz.  I don't know anything about women -- been married for twenty-six years.
You hit a person with the oranges in the towel, they get big, awful looking bruises, but they don't really get hurt, not if you do it right. It's for working scams against insurance companies.
Not skimming a thing, Lilly?
Evening. Welcome to Phoenix.
And I'll want to leave an early wake-up call.
Mary Beth! This has never been anything but --
Not much time.
Well, make it stop!
Bobo wants you to go on to Delmar.
Delmar? I never go out to California. That's a thousand miles from here.
Whadaya say?
When I said you being the best salesman here didn't say much, I meant for us. I know your record with Sarber and Webb, and I'd say you're a top-flight man, but you've had no incentive. No one walking on your heels. Just a lot of half asses, so the tendency's been not to stretch yourself. I'm bouncing the slobs, incidentally.
I take care of the being-fair-to-me department. Things've gone to hell this long, they can go a little longer.
That's what we'll do, then. But I tell you what, Roy. Before I hire anybody else, I'll ask you one last time. Fair enough?
So what's your story today?
You do not! Roy Dillon? Cornball clown pictures? Commission salesman? It's all a front, isn't it? You're on the grift, I know you are. You're working some angle, and don't tell me you're not because I wrote the book!
Sure.
Four grand. For the hospital. Is that enough?
I sat in there with her, I thought, what do I do now? Run and I've got Bobo and the law after me. Stay, and how do I explain?
Bobo isn't after you! Bobo's after me, and he's goddamn good! But so am I. I'm a survivor, Roy. I survive.
I know you do, so that's why --
I know what's bugging you, of course.
A bad mother. By any standards. I've thought about it, you know, from your side, since then. I know just how bad I was.
) That's what it is, isn't it? Keep me down. Your turn to be in charge, have the power.
You were bleeding inside, honey. Remember that bruise you had?
You're just comfortable, that's all. You don't even ask to go home. You just lie around, let your mama take care of you.
I'll pay Lilly back, don't you worry about that.
I don't see why we have to take the train.
No.
The tap. What you do for a living.
Myra, I'm not following this.
The long end. Big con.
It was beautiful. And getting better all the time.
He'd explain he had to have cash, so there wouldn't be any paper trail for the SEC. And a lot of cash, or it wasn't worth while. The least we ever took was forty thousand, and the most was one hundred eighty-five thousand dollars! From one sucker!
I thought these people were broke.
What happened to Cole?
I need a partner, Roy. I need an inside man, and you're it. You could be as wonderful as Cole.
Regret what? I didn't say I was coming aboard.
It may be Lilly, but it isn't suicide.
Yes, I know, I know.
They said on the phone you were assigned to the Meyers case.
I can be real stiff.
We're sorry to startle you, Miss Tate.
My god...
It's an option.
Oh, so now it's my fault?
I'm sorry, alright?  It was just a stupid joke.
This kid just wants his freedom.
Let the party begin.
Why?  You interested?
Hold on, hot lips.  We got work to do.
But I've seen him!
Come on, Mom.  We're gonna miss all the fun stuff!
No, please listen!  They're coming ... coming for me and my baby.
God, what's wrong with him?
Notify Haddonfield's sheriff; tell him we're on our way.  I want the entire staff on alert.  We go to code red lockdown for twenty-four hours.  If he is alive, I plan on bringing him back.
Come now, Sam.  This is a gathering of old friends.  I know how difficult this must be for you -- a man of your upbringing and integrity -- but now that I'm in charge I felt it was only fair that you finally know the truth.  After all, you're the only one around here who's still in the dark, as it were.  This isn't the way I wanted to tell you, but you've really given me no other choice.
It appears that we're going to have to wait awhile for any more action here, Colonel.  Why don't you run on home while the evening's young.
How everybody says "fuck" and "shit" all the time.  I used to be scared shitless I'd say "fuck" or "shit" in public, by accident.  Now everybody says "fuck" and "shit," "fuck" and "shit" all the time. Something very big must have happened while we were out of the country.
Looseleaf--will you get the hell home?
What'll you do for transportation?
You know what gets me?  Those guys who went to the moon!  To the moon, boy!
And how were things?
Otherwise, how are things?
First Nagasaki--now this.
Alice would be absolutely tear-ass.
I didn't know we had any women left.
I told you the uniform wouldn't help.
I dunno.
You know her for what she is now-- garbage.
You never played a violin.
Me?
Everybody thinks that.
I don't think so.  It could have been.
Blue soup.
Fifty years?
You're making a joke.
You invited me.
Sir?
Hello.
Dr. Woodly.  I should make a little list.
You think you could find me a pencil and paper?
And you've been roaming the streets while your mother is God-knows-where?
Man and boy.
It makes life spicy.
He doesn't do it in front of me, but he does it with Mother.  You know what he called Father one time?
Nothing.  He plays a violin in a doctors' quartet.
Mhravitch.
It's rather a disappointment these days.  It isn't there any more.
Penelope!
A hundred dollars!
Couldn't you have vanished quietly out the back door?
No.
Of course it is.  Is it loaded?
Gee whiz, Dad--
I'm sorry, sir, I'm engaged to be married.  My boyfriend would be mad if I went out with another man.
Situation.
Well--enjoy the natural, honest, unrehearsed result--surgical shock.
What's that all about?
I don't want that chancre mechanic in here.
A trip, you mean?
You're thinking with your brain instead of your body.  That's why you're so tense!  Forget Norbert. Relax.  It's body time.
I have some change!
She's up in Heaven now.  She didn't hear.  She is experiencing nothing but pure happiness.  There's nothing nicer than that.  Chow!  Harold Ryan wants chow!
You don't know you want.  That's the way God built you!
Such as?...
The whole concept of heroism--and its sexual roots.
You learned this in some college course?
And what is his most cherished possession?
Yes.
That's too bad.  I would rather have him at home--to see what I'm going to do.
Things.
Money?  There's plenty of that. Mildred got the brewery.  You'll probably get the baseball team.
See how you've upset him.  He was so merry and hale before you came home.
If he thinks he's man enough.
This is suicide.  Go get the police.
Ah!  The lady is armed.
She's right, Norbert--go home. WOODLY I haven't said all I have to say.
We tried to be.  We tried to be.
He's dead, you know.
Hello?  Oh--hello, Mother.
Look--I'm sorry--I have to go.
I mean--I can't leave you here. You'll have to go.  I'll tell Mrs. Ryan you were here.  You can come back later.
Will you please go?  An emergency!
Neighbor!  Doctor!  I live across the hall.
Colonel Harper and I once shared a treetop with a family of bats. There was a flash flood.  There were piranha fish in the water. That's how Colonel Harper lost his little toe.
Pacqualinincheewa root.  Means "cougar fang." Cures anything but a yellow streak down the back.
We have, have we?
I thought she was a widow.
I'm going to have to report you to the Department of Health.
It died for your sins.
What brought you back?
You intend to crack my eardrums with your voice?  Will I bleed from my every orifice?  Who will clean up this awful mess?
You're old--so old.
You're a son of a bitch.
You're a clown.  You're a clown who kills--but you're a clown.
I'll put it in Paul's room, where it belongs.
She married an accountant named Stanley Kestenbaum.
Jesus.
Is it?  I have this theory about why men kill each other and break things.
I'll kill myself.
He's a ghost!
Still lives with his mother.
I was afraid to ask.
Yeah.
How's the fungus around your thumbnail?
I hate that thing.
He'd kill me.  He'd be right to kill me, too--the kind of guy he is.
All through the day I'm so confident.  That's why I'm such a good salesman, you know?  I have confidence, and I look like I have confidence, and that gives other people confidence.  People laugh sometimes when they find out I'm a vacuum cleaner salesman.  They stop laughing, though, when they find out I made forty-three thousand dollars last year.  I've got six other salesmen working under me, and what they all plug into is my confidence.  That's what charges them up.
I'm touched.
Beautiful!  I've never seen that coat.
Then I saw this bakery store that was still open, so I bought a birthday cake.
A what?
What?
We've got to dump Shuttle.  He brings his vacuum cleaner on dates?
No!  Oh no!  Three people murdered in there in the last six weeks! The police won't even go in there any more.
They didn't murder me.
Everything's going to be beautiful.
The late Mrs. Harold Ryan.
I'm sick of this argument.  I just have one more thing to say: If you elect a President, you support him, no matter what he does.  That's the only way you can have a country!
Jack the Ripper plays shuffleboard.
We're going to have jackets, aren't we?
What do you mean, not the type? Don't you know who I am? I'm Big Dick Brown! I've been in more porno movies than you ever saw. I've worked with Harry Reems. I've worked with Johnny Wad. Not the type! I can come ten times a day. I can keep it hard two hours at a time. My cock is nine inches long.
I said I hope she's a runaway. Better that than she just disappears like so many others do. Sometimes they turn up years later, sometimes not. A lot of crimes go unreported, unknown. These are realities.
Big threat. TV would ream you.
No.
You're not Vice, are you?  Do you work for the Los Angeles Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?
Well, actually I wanted to ask about this girl. I have her picture here.
Pull out your cock.
What do you mean?
Now, what do you want?
...about this woman.  I'm trying to find her. Do you know her?
Overpowering?
Are you the star of this picture?
Sure. Like in Mikey and Niki. Did you see that picture?
Um-hm. Live sound.
Where's he?
Okay. My client pays for it anyway.
When do we start?
No.
And your wife? Where's she?
Is that the way it was with you?
You and I, Niki, have very different ideas about sex.
What does that mean?  What does he do?
You have to believe in something. What do they believe in -- the Whatjamacillit church?
Listen, Niki. My daughter's been missing five months. I've gone through a lot to find out what's happened to her. I just saw a girl killed. I will not let Tod slip out of my hands. You have to tell me where he is.
You are.
That's right.
As I was saying, I'll pick up the thread. There's a number of ways I can go. There's not much you can do here. Stay if you want. Maybe it'd be better if you went back home. Go through Kristen's personal stuff. Ask around, maybe she knew somebody out here.  Look, I do this a lot. I work at a minimum rate of $750.00 a week. It may seem like a lot of money to you, but it ain't. You could hire cheaper.
And better?
What are you paying me for?
Do you know what a "hardcore" movie is?
Yeah. You ever seen any of those?
Where is she?
Oh, fuck off. You should stay where you belong.
Andy, can you do something for her? Maybe money...
Yeah. She's quite upset. I'm going to fly out today. They want me to bring some pictures.
Hey man.
Oh yeah? I've done a lot of good stuff. Shorts, features. No major roles it's true. But good stuff.
God, I don't know what it was called. I never saw it. I only got twenty- five bucks for the whole Goddamned thing.
Okay.
What do you want?  Do I know you from somewhere?
You wait here. I'll find out where she is.
Fifty cents admission.
What?
That's all right.
Yes.  I'm interested in financing an adult feature film. I was told you were the man to come to.
Well, Bill -- mind if I call you Bill?  Let me be frank. I've made a lot of money. I've got my own business in Detroit. Rivets. I make rivets and sell them to Fisher Body.  Well, rivets, you know, can get pretty boring after a while. When my business manager told me I should shelter some money, I thought I'd try this.
I thought I'd invest in a film. I want to sort of become involved in the process of making a film, meet the people who make films, learn how it's done...
In other words, you want to get laid?
Sounds all right.
What does that do?
Huh?
Eh, Poli Sci?
He seems very nice. Is Harold interested in, eh, what's going on? I think it's such a super thing to study. And then, of course, I can always fall back on home ec.
Is this your shovel?
Where are the papers?
Me neither. I heard he was eighty years old. I'll be eighty next week. A good time to move on, don't you think?
How do you do? I am Dame Marjorie Chardin, but you may call me Maude.
No, thank you. I have my car.
And you get into any car you want and just drive off?
What owners, Harold? We don't <u>own</u> anything. It's a transitory world. We come on the earth with nothing, and we go out with nothing, so isn't "ownership" a little absurd?
But it's oat straw tea. You've never had oat straw tea, have you?
Heavens no! I don't have the time. But I like to keep in practice and poor Glaucus occasionally needs his memory refreshed as to the contours of the female form.  Do you disapprove?
Now I'll pump it up...  ... and you just turn the handles.  Okay. What do you smell?
Look at it, Harold. It's suffocating. It's the smog. People can live with it, but it gives trees asthma. They can't breathe. See the leaves are all brown. Harold, we've got to do something about this life.
But we can't just dig it up!
We'll come back in the morning.
What were you fighting for?
But they have.
That wasn't very scary.
Scared? Swimming underwater with that oxygen device of yours. I was petrified.
I don't know. Perhaps.
- end where I began.
"And this too shall pass away."
Of course, Harold's father had a similar sense of the absurd. I remember once in Paris he stepped out for cigarettes and the next I hear he's arrested for floating nude down the Seine - experimenting in river currents with a pair of yellow rubber water wings. Well, that cost quite a little bit of "enfluence" and "d'argent" to hush up, I can tell you. Harold, dear, stop playing with your food. Don't you feel well?
Not now, Harold...  You can't put me down for Monday?
Mother. I'm going to get married.
Oh, is this your father?
Well, a rough estimate... I'd say fifteen.
No. It's the junk. I like to look at junk.
That's very interesting, Harold, and I think very illuminative. There seems to be a definite pattern emerging.  Your fondness for useless machines and demolitions seems indicative of your present emotional state, your self-destructive urges and your alienation from the regular social interaction. What do you think? And of course this pattern once isolated can be coped with. Recognize the problem and you are half way on the road to its solution. But tell me, what do you do for <u>fun</u>? What activity gives you a different sense of enjoyment than the others? What do you find fulfilling? What gives you that certain satisfaction?
You don't seem to be listening. I asked do you have any friends?
Yes.
I see. Tell me, Harold, do you remember your father at all?
And so I ask you - why the hell did we give up on the Germans? Those damn politicians in Washington chalked them up on our side and the wars ever since have been a national disgrace. Hell, look at history. The two best wars this country has fought were against the Jerries. Now I say, get the Krauts on the other side of the fence where they belong, and let's get back to the kind of enemy worth killing and the kind of war this whole country can support.
They came at me from all sides, hundreds of 'em. We kept firing - Zat-Tat-Tat-Tat! "Throw the grenades," I shouted. "Mac, throw the grenades!" "He's dead," Joe said, and kept right on feeding me bullets.  Zat-Tat-Tat-Tat!  They kept falling, but they kept coming. Bullets whizzing all around me. Zot! Joe falls back with a neat red hole in his head. I thought I was done for. But I kept firing. Zat-Tat-Tat! Only one thought kept me going. Kill! Kill! For Mac, and Joe, and the rest of the guys. Kill! - a blinding flash. I wake up on a stretcher. "Did we hold?" I asked the medic. "Yes, sir," he said, and I slipped into unconsciousness.
You think so, sir?
To pit your own life against another.
That's right.
Oh, sure. A variety of weapons.
How about hand-to-hand combat?
Yes.
Harold!
Good afternoon, Officer. Bit of trouble here?
Was that the one with the St. Christopher medal on the dashboard?
Were you also the one who painted the statues?
She's done it.
Sad, huh? She's been here six months. Her name's TIFFANY.
Help. No, no-one can help. I just want someone to listen or I WILL go crazy.
The Boxes. In the House. I told you.
Are you crazy?
No deals! Just information. Information. Free of charge. No strings. Just information.
Who?
Is he serious??
They were over here, Professor.
Look at them ugly suckers, Blue. One sheet of glass between them and us.
I break it, they see us, Happy Halloween. No more hiding.  Outside. I could be outside --
Liz left us, Red. Take the hint.
Red. How long was it latched onto you?
Rotten eggs and the safety of mankind.
What is it?
Do you believe in hell?
C'mon -- Rasputin??
What the hell was that? An ape?
Reliquary --
How does he know so much about me?
1945, you mean. Hitler died in '45.
It is. You got yourself on TV again.
Grounded? Who's grounded?
He gets fed six times a day. He's got a thing for cats. You'll be his nanny, his keeper, his best friend. He never goes out unsupervised --
No, it doesn't make it right, but I stopped that creature, didn't I?
"One falls, two shall arise." So: you pop one, two come out. You kill two, you get four. You kill four, you're in trouble. We have to nail 'em all at once. And the eggs.
We should go back -- you -- you could tear that door apart --
Anything else you --
Doesn't sounds like him.
He's just pushy.
That you feel that way about me.
Will you sign for the bed?
It's just a puzzle box.
He doesn't see us, or hear us. We belong to you, Kirsty. And you to us.
We've got such sights to show you --
Well the police are going to want to speak to you. You know that.
Come to Daddy.
You're Julia, right?
Oh.  Oh yes.
Believe me. It's me. It's really me.
His blood... on the floor... It brought me back.
My nerves... are beginning to work again.
Poor Larry. Obedient as ever.
A long time.
It's not any box. It's called the Lament Configuration. It's a puzzle.
To experience beyond anything ever known. At least that's what I was promised when I bought it. Pleasure from Heaven or Hell. I didn't much care which.
The Cenobites. The creatures the box set free.  Sometimes I think they're still here. Just behind the walls. Them and their hooks and their beasts. Just waiting to break out again. Except that I've got the box.
You would be. They tore me apart.
That's probably her now. Or the police.
Well we can't just stay here --
What's the problem?
So what's the argument?
No argument.
Take it slowly.
So damn stupid.
Are you all right?
Maybe a brandy.
I'll be down in a minute
Fine.
What are you drinking?
I try not to drink at lunch-time. Makes me sleepy in the afternoon. You like to keep a clear head, eh?  One soda, one whisky.  I do it anyway. No will-power. Got a busy afternoon?
I suppose that's right.
I... suppose so, yes.
No, not much.
Am I?
You wouldn't believe me.
Well I want you to see the house.
I'll come over and see you in the next few days. You can show me the mansion. O.K.?
Surprise.
Maybe you should give it some time.
I want to see.
I won't be able to stand.
Yeah, there's room. And there's Julia.
There ya go.  I beg your pardon?
Oh no?
It's not what I heard.
I've been better.
Alison's.
Really?  Married Kevin?  Her junior high sweetheart... What chance would I have had against that?  None, no chance.  That's just fate.
What's next?
Yeah.
-- You're like a little squirrel of music, storing away dead little nuts of old garbage music, musical lint, old shit, shit, shit --
...But the word "yet..." Yeah, you know what, I'd get the impression that you wanted to see it.  Otherwise you'd say you didn't really want to.
Whatever.  Okay. "Tell Laura I Love Her." That'd bring the house down. Laura's mom could sing it.
What is she doing?  Okay, 20%.
Sonic Death Monkey.
I'm looking for a record for my daughter.  For her birthday.  "I Just Called To Say I Love You." Do you have it?
What's your problem?  What did I... Why are you --
Well what about the new Echo --
That is perverse.  Do not tell anyone you don't own fucking Blonde on Blonde.  What about Television?
Don't do it, Rob!
What are you talking about?
I'm looking for Deejay Rob Gordon.
Oh boy... In the club, or at home?
Is there a difference?
Nevermind.  Any five.  So four more.
Is that it?
Nice friend.
Okay. "Dance Music For Old People?"
'Morning, Dick.
No, that's okay.  Really.
'Cause you like their second one, you said, Pop, Girls. etc.  The one with Cheryl Ladd on the cover.  You didn't see the cover though.
Yeah, I haven't really absorbed that one.
Hey.  Didn't you steal that one already?
Let's not.
I dunno.
Hi.
What were the others?
I am not living with him.  I've just been staying with him for a few days until I work out what I'm doing. Look, this has nothing to do with anyone else.  You know that, don't you?  I left because we weren't exactly getting along, and we weren't talking about it.  And I suddenly realized that I like my job, and I like what my life is could be turning into, and that I'm getting to a point where I want to get my shit together and I can't really see that ever happening with you, and yeah, yeah, I sort of get interested in someone else, and that went further than it should have, so it seemed like a good time to go.  But I have no idea what will happen with Ian in the long run.  Probably nothing.
Yeah.  Great.
I'm too tired for this now.  I know I'm asking a lot, but will you take off for a while so I can get my stuff packed up?  I need to be able to think while I do it and I can't think while you're here.
Jesus Christ, Rob.  Is that really what's bothering you?
Never?
I haven't felt like it.
I don't have your number.
Are you still in love with me?
I'm sorry, but can we get this straight?  What is his fucking name, Ian or Ray?  What do you call him?
You make me laugh much more than Ray does, if that's what you're getting at.  But I already knew you could make me laugh.  It's everything else I don't know about.
You know I'm a good person.
Hello.
Pig died.
Who the fuck's Pig?
No, no.  When are you going home?
What?
I've only got a couple left.  I'm saving them for later.
Look, we can do other things.
What it was like.
... Like Mexico.  Or Jamaica.  Or New York, even.
But why doesn't it matter that we're not the same people we used to be?
You haven't changed so much as a pair of socks in the years I've known you.  If we've grown apart, then I'm the one who's done the growing, and all I've done is change jobs.
I can't go to work with my hair dyed pink.  And I can afford to go shopping more now, and I've met a couple people I like over the last year or so.
Harder.
Less neurotic.  Are you intending to stay the same for the rest of your life?
Barry said its done.
I'm going to talk to you.
I know.
Shut up.  I'm only trying to explain.
No.  They don't know him.  And Ken liked you.  Rob, Ken didn't die for your benefit, you know.  It's like everybody's a supporting actor in the film of your life story.
I'd like it if you could stay the night.
And so it is.  I'll talk to you later.
Everything all right?
Well call her mother.
I knew this would happen.  What are you going to do Rob?
I know what they're worth.  Give me fifty and get them out.
Sure.  Ten cents.
Eno import.  Sigue Sigue Sputnik. Break beats.  Serge Gainsbourg. Ryuchi Sakamoto, Syd Barrett... What's going on here?  Are you guys stealing for other people now?
Naw.  Those are for us.
Nice.
I warned you.
You're very macabre.
I've been trying to find somebody who knew him and any connections his family might have had with museums or historical societies.
Poor little tyke didn't have a chance.  Hopelessly premature.  He died a few days after he was born.
I don't know what you're talking about.
The estate stuff is pretty straight forward.  Just lots of forms and an appearance at the county seat.
William Taupin seems to have left his mark.
I'm not even sure why.
You and your buddy make a real team, don't you?  Exchanging eloquent threats in iambic pen- tameter while hacking up all the innocents in between.
There are differences.
Don't.
Come here, Brenna.
Will I see you again?
No!
You have lived forever.
Now there's a new topic.
Forgers do it all the time.  They take the birth certificate of some- one who died young and use it to get legit I.D.  Usually they carry it long enough to pass some bad checks then dump it.
But there's more.  Wednesday someone played javelin with the cemetary curator in Felton, Delaware.  Some locals spotted two cars with D.C. plates and surprise surprise, they turn out to be registered to our own Brenna Cartwright and the ever popular Richard Taupin.
Come on Brenna, your ass is already in a sling, don't drag me into it.
Hang on a sec, you did your little favor for the boys downtown, I'm sure your uncle and the rest are perfectly capable of taking it from here.
-Auditorium nostrum-
Aye.
Your marks would suggest great injury.
I was nearly killed.
You are the same?
Yes.  Always.
You feel you know me.
I don't know why.
Conor, you and I, we cannot be killed.
It is the truth.
You must be.  You have responsibilities. You must learn the rules.  You can never attract attention to yourself, never show the side that will draw others to you.  You will always know when you are in the presence of another.  Beware. But more importantly Conor MacLeod, will be your battle against time.  In the coming years you will see kingdoms rise then rot like wheat.  People will become a transitory, pathetic lot.  The only constant you will know will be the others and the tradition their greed and quest represent.  But life without morality, without the ability to truly taste the sweetness of wine and love, is no life at all.  That is how the others exist.  Nothing more than walking corpses living only to slaughter each other in an insane quest to be the last.  Keep your soul sewed to the earth.  Do not become one of them.
I'm your future husband, remember?
But I did live.
Live?  In less than a week you're prancing about the country like a squirrel.
No doubt.
You're wrong.
Complete your inspection?
Equals?
Your grandfather wore that in his service to the King, and I to fight for the Duke.
Won't know till the records department comes back with it this after- noon.  Looks good though. They found the receipt in his townhouse.  It was pretty smeared but had Taupin's father listed as a signatory.
Think we should call the local P.D. out there first?
What are you doing here?
This isn't done.  Get up.
What's the point!  You have me, finish it!
It's all we have.
Did you know the victim?
No.
A claymore to be exact.  You wouldn't know anything about it would you?
Do you?
The resemblance is amazing.
Ready? The Sheriff's just put two hundred more relatives on the payroll to protect the city against the Red Army -- which is leaving Moscow in a couple of minutes.  Up a dime.
What's the idea of locking this?
Bensinger -- of the Tribune.
Heartbreaking! How would you like to work for me?
If anybody had told me I'd be sitting at lunch with him -- but he swept me right off my feet.
Say, what's happened to Burns? He looks sunk, doesn't he?
And what's the matter with a thousand dollars?
About twenty-five hundred dollars.
But --
I can't imagine who did it. I can't think of any enemies I have.
I'm sure you haven't any.
I know I got you into this, Hildy, but it does seem to me that you can't care much for me if you're willing to let me stay locked up for two hours.
Oh -- mother -- she -- I don't know where she went.
I'm taking the nine o'clock train, Hildy. And you can meet us at the station.
Just what is the lowdown on Williams?
And remember this, Bruce! I love her, too.
Well, Bruce, here you are -- certified and everything.
Don't thank me. I should thank you. So long.
I know how you feel, Bruce, but you've got to forgive her. She's only a woman, after all.
Who do you think you are, breaking in here like this?
No? Well --  Johnson, you're under arrest.  You, too, Burns.
Divorced me. It sort of makes a fellow lose faith in himself. It almost gives him a feeling he wasn't wanted.
I suppose that's true in a way. I am fond of you, Walter. I often wish you weren't such a stinker.
A fellow your age, hiring an airplane to write:  'Hildy: Don't be hasty -- remember my dimple. Walter.! It held things up twenty minutes while the Judge ran out to watch it.
Deny it! I'm proud of it! We beat the whole country on that story.
Sure, come on. We'll have some lunch and you can tell me everything.
Sure you can. Come on.
Sweeney! You can't do that to me! Not today, of all days! Jumping Jehosophat! Oh, no, Sweeney... Well, I suppose so... All right. If you have to, you have to.  How do you like that? Everything happens to me -- with 365 days in the year -- this has to be the day.
Listen, you bumble-headed baboon --
Great grief! What's that other paper going to give you?
I'm not working for any other paper!
A journalist! Peeking through keyholes -- running after fire engines -- waking people up in the middle of the night to ask them if they think Hitler's going to start a war -- stealing pictures off old ladies of their daughters that got chased by apemen! I know all about reporters -- a lot of daffy buttinskies going around without a nickel in their pockets, and for what? So a million hired girls and motormen's wives will know what's going on! No, Walter, I'm through.
Where'd you meet this man?
Bermuda... Rich, eh?
Oh sure, it's honest. But somehow, I can't picture you with a guy who sells policies.
Well, he's waiting in the anteroom for me now.
Say, could I meet him?
You said it.
What do you think I am -- a crook?
All right. The check will be certified. Want my fingerprints?
Exclusive? That's great.
That's great work, Hildy... Huh? Oh, will you stop worrying about the money? I'll see you get it in fifteen minutes.
I know, but --
You can't take that desk out. It's crawling with cops outside.
Well, keep going! We want an extra out on the streets before it's too late!
Where's Bruce?
What did you do with her?
Where is she? Tell me!
Is this the Community Hospital?
Butch! I'd put my arm in fire for you -- up to here!  Now, you can't double-cross me!... She does? All right -- put her on. I'll talk to her... Hello! Oh, hello, Madam... Now listen, you ten-cent glamour girl, you can't keep Butch away from his duty... What's that? You say that again and I'll come over there and knock your eye out! Hello?  I'll kill 'em! I'll kill both of 'em!  Duffy!  Mousing around with some big blonde Annie on my time! That's co-operation!  Duffy!!
No!
Just until we can get out a special edition asking for your impeachment.
That's what makes it romantic. Every other married couple goes away on a honeymoon and for two weeks the bride knows just where the groom is, and vice versa. But us -- you never know where I am and I'm not sure where you are. That's Romance!
What's the matter with my brains?
What's the good of arguing about something that probably doesn't exist? Look, Hildy, I'm proposing to you. What do you say?
Well, I'd like to be lady-like and think it over.
Are you referring to me, Madam?
What?
You're crazy. Where's Mac?
There's money in it, Cooley.
They're always after me for interviews.
We'll have to satisfy them. What would you say to giving them a joint interview? I could give them some of the psychological aspects of the case and you could give them the legal aspects.
It doesn't matter. The publicity's the main thing.
Well, it wasn't exactly that way --
Say, that's old Prissy Bensinger's desk.
Trouble is, when the Red Menace shows up the Sheriff will still be crying 'Wolf!'
Oh, nothing much. Just that the state had proved he was sane -- and he admits it himself. If you don't want me to run it --
A fine fair-weather friend you are!
I did.  Hold the wire.
Hello, Olsen... Listen...  Shoot to kill... That's the orders pass the word along... No! We dont want him! And listen, Olsen, five- hundred bucks for the guy that does the job... Yes, I'll be right out there.  Well, I hope that's the right thing to do.
Now take that guilty look off your face, Pete -- and stop trembling like a horse.
Aiding an escaped criminal! And a little charge of kidnapping I'm looking into.  But that's the jail! There must be somebody there!
I'm telling you. Can you imagine bumping into a load of cops?! They come rollin' out like oranges!
Well, Hildy, we were only saying that a swell reporter like you wouldn't give this up so easily.
So long, nothing! Where's Bruce Baldwin's wallet?
I didn't frisk him. He must have dropped it in Burns' office. I didn't know whose it was.
Mother, I can explain everything. I'll go with you in five minutes and --
You're not going to shoot me, Earl. I'm your friend, remember? I've got to write that story about your "Production for Use".
I don't blame you, Earl.  If I were in your place I wouldn't trust anybody, either.
Quiet, Mollie, quiet!
Stop screaming, Mollie or we're sunk. I'm trying to think of something before those reporters get back.
What good'll it do?
Come on, Mollie. This is no place for you. 
Hey --
No, I don't think so.
I'll explain it tomorrow!
Get out of here!
Well -- Williams goes a little balmy and begins making speeches on a plan he's got to save the world. Only he makes his speeches, usually, on a very busy street and neglects to get a license for it. Well, the cops let him alone as much as they can because he's harmless and they're kinda sorry for him. But one day he decides to hold a meeting right in the middle of a Veteran's Parade and the cops chase him. He gets scared and goes into hiding.  Come in, Dave Schwartz.
What's he want?
Do you know any swear words?
Well go on then. You can't join if you can't answer.
...and four and five...
You don't like jam. You hate jam. You never eat jam.
Well, for the baby, really.
But Dad, It's the News.
They send over a few every day, to let them know we're still here. Each shell costs as much as a Ford 8.
Who pays for them?
Boy, that was some air-raid.
Don't panic!  Keep your head!
You joined up.
Oh, that.
He always knows.
I don't believe this is happening to me.
...such nice boys with straw boaters and blazers. All the punts lit up with Chinese lanterns. Like fireflies. And the gramophone going on one of the boats. Always the Charleston, the Charleston, the Charleston. Oh, you girls.
I can't do it. What's the point?
Mac, that was wonderful. I haven't been to a concert since...
It's all better left unsaid, Grace.
I wish it could all have been different.
It's not fair on them. It's selfish to keep them with you.
I didn't mean it like that, Grace. Why does it always come out wrong?
Whoa, thanks for stopping. I been standing out there in that toad strangling rain for like a hundred million years.
I'll cut your fucking tits off and shove 'em down your throat.
Is your brother ready to go?
Thank you.
A dead one.
Hey, great they're back.
He walks, duh.
Better than pissing... anyway so, what's your choice?
If we're talking cute... like regular cute, I'd say Leslie Van Houton, but cute ain't hot.
Yeah, no shit.
As far a hot... goes I gotta go with... Ruth Ann Moorehouse.
I'll let it slide, she was only seventeen.
Yeah.
I hope you fixed the spare like I asked ya.
We'll need pictures of the inside too.
We can't leave her out here in the rain... maybe we can just drop her at the next rest area.
How much is a person supposed to stand?
Quiet.
What I need are some answers. 
And I gave 'em directions out there, up by the old farm row... I figured what's the harm. Stupid kids probably going out to piss up a rope and got themselves turned around backasswards and got lost as shit.
Shit, this ain't worth nothing now that my name gotten all over it. I was a fixin' on trading it to Jackie Cobb.
Yeah, I guess, you know next to wacking his weasel his other favorite thing is twisting sharpened pencils in the corner of his eyes.
Yeah, doesn't hurt himself, just spins it around next to his eyeball.
Had to take him to the hospital. Kid had Dr. Zaius stuck half way up his butt, couldn't get it out.
I always loved that mute broad that Chuck Heston was shacking up with.
Yeah, in this book there's a chapter called Self Made Freaks about how people would mutilate themselves in order to work in a freak show. It mostly talks about tattooed people and wild men of Borneo and shit like that, but there is one mention of a single case where a woman was suspected of having her arms removed on purpose to become an arm-less wonder.
It says, "records show that Ellie Thompson was born in 1914 of normal physical stature and lived a life of normal bearings, until such time that she was placed in the care of the Willows State Mental Facility."
Why?
Yeah?
You know what Jerry, who really cares at this point?
Thank you.
What are you laughing at?
Sleeping.
Aw, it ain't crap... it's... cute.  ...and really who are we to judge the artistic merit of the tin-can Mona Lisa?
Tell me about it.
What'd we here, Georgie?
Holy Jesus, somebody had themselves a field day beating the shit outta this thing.
Just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Hey, maybe the guy with the tow truck could drive us to a phone.
His name is Rufus, Rufus Jr., but we all call him R.J.
And I'm gonna help put the razor blades in the candy apples.
I'll bet you are... you are a naughty little thing aren't ya.
OK lassies, I think it's time you get to gripping reality.
I'm with Denise, can't we just walk to someplace, this is getting fucking stupid.
This can't be real, this can't be real, this can't be real.
What are you doing?  ...no, stop... please, please.
Christ, four kids couldn't just disappear.
Tell it to my daughter.
Jesus Christ.
Mr. Willis?
Well, we were on our way out to run a check on a couple farmhouses out on the edge of town... closest thing we got to a lead at this point.
Well, all we know is the kids were headed out to a spot the locals call Deadwood to play Nancy Drew with some local legend about this character everybody calls Dr. Satan.
I hope you're right, but my guts are telling me different.
It's embarrassing, okay?
Why, because I'm a freak and you are beautiful, and you are being nice enough to come down to my freak, nonbeautiful level and act concerned about my repulsive troubles?
Say my name.
No. Don't be silly. It's just...
Listen, you're the best assistant I've ever had... Gabrielle.
What is wrong, my darling?
But?... But? There is a "but," Nathan.
You were wonderful today, darling. Such authority with the ape-man boy. It made me so hot for you.
Yeah? What?
So we've got seventeen new bookings for speaking engagements, my wonderful men.
Lila?
Yes, please, somebody ask him what is wrong.
That is horrible. Apes are dirty. No?
My apologies, madam.
We bury the body. We disappear into the woods. Nobody knows.
My brother is discreet.
I really like him, Rose. He's so...  ...passionate about his work.
Don't throw that away. I had that once with a guy. But I threw it away for a cheap thrill.
I didn't know you were into that sort of thing.
Rose, please go away.
Oh, Rosie.
They don't seem to be especially ego driven, this is true.
You've got to respect that.
I'm sorry?
It's only that I really enjoy your company and...
Actually, Mother and Father, you look very, very old. You look terrible.
What SPF, sweetie?
I think I'll get Johannsen in chemistry on that.  Oh! Did you bring the first aid kit?
Did you see that?
A deer?
I think he's feral.
He looks perfectly fine.
It's perfect!
Is he, Lila? Is he happy living filthy and naked alone in this tick infested wilderness? Never to know the love of a good woman, never to revel in the pitter-patter of little feet, never to read Moby Dick, or marvel at a Monet, or just sit back after a day of hard but rewarding work, smoke a pipe, and wonder about the nature of reality.
You'd be taking away his freedom, Nathan.
All right.
It's hormonal, Nathan. I can't help it. I'm sorry.
Apes don't shave, you son of a bitch!
Everything's fine, honey. We don't need to talk. Besides I have to work late.
I'm just preoccupied.
Really?
Oh!  I didn't see you there, sneaky boy!  You're like a boy sneaking in...
Nothing. Hard day. Gonna have a drink.
Nah. You just relax. How's the book?
How the hell would you know anything about the human heart?
Shut up! Yeah, this is Lila, cunt. And don't let the hirsutism fool you. I know more about being a woman, and more about the black hearts of men than you, in your pretty little powdered, bullshit fantasy world, can ever imagine. I know the darkness and cruelty of nature, sweetie pie.
Oh boy!
I don't think this aversion therapy is really necessary, doctor. I understand the problem.
And because you did so well, we have a little surprise for you.
Ugnh.
I love Lila. I mean, she's a wonderful person. And... she loves me! That's no small potatoes. I mean she really loves me. She's sacrificed so much to be in this relationship with me. And she's a good person. A truly good person. How rare is that in this world, eh? And how could I stop loving somebody because of a little physical imperfection, if it can even be called that. I mean, God knows I'm not perfect! What about my eyesight? It's lousy, that's what! Lila's not going to leave me because of my eyesight. What about my penis?
Huh?
You didn't answer my first question. For whom?
How?
Could be.
How much?
Only when I work.
So I got talent. So what beat me?
Yeah. Sure, sure.
Maybe he knows how to drink.
You bet he knows how.  You think that's a talent too, huh? Knowin' how to drink whisky? You think Minnesota Fats was born knowin' how to drink?
Okay, okay... What do I do now, lie down on the floor and, uh, bow from the ankles? What do I do, go home?
First time in ten years I ever saw Minnesota Fats hooked, really hooked. But you let him off.
You think I can lose?
There are places. I'll scuffle around.
Word's out on you, Eddie. You walk in the wrong kind of place and they'll eat you alive.
I been thinking.
Sarah Packard... Bert Gordon.
What? And he -- he hustles pool?
What's that supposed to mean?
They're fine.
I got time, Bert.
Tell her what?
Eddie?...  YOU OWE ME MONEY!
Yeah, we're gonna make a lotta money together, from now on.
Druggist supplies. Buster here is gonna get an award.  No, he sold seventeen thousand bucks' worth of stuff last month. Fastest boy in the territory.
I couldn't, huh? Okay. Go ahead. Set 'em up the way they were before.
Go ahead. Set 'em up the way they were before. Bet ya twenty bucks. Make that shot just the way I made it before.
Approximately? One thousand bucks.
Eleven thousand four hundred, cash. Here in my pocket.
Ah, get with it, will ya, Charlie?
You walked out on me like that. No goodbye, no nothing. Like a thief in the dark. We were partners. We were more than partners.  He was like a... like --
What for? To play Fats again?
Just like that?
Now and then. Why, do you?
Would you like to come out tonight?
Here.  Been an interestin' evening.
Yeah. You must come again.
Shoot.
How long have you been waiting?
Have a nice trip.
Can I sit down?
Thanks for the, uh, for the breakfast.
No, not always.
You don't look like a college girl.
What do you do on the other days?
I could always get us a bottle.
How did you know my name was Sarah?
Where you been all day?
I'm hungry.
I've got something in my bag.
Yeah. I met this guy -- Gordon, Bert Gordon. He said I was. Born loser.
You glad?
Two.  Sherry?... Nice joint. You look very pretty.
For how long?
I got no idea of love. And neither have you. I mean, neither one of us would know what it was if we saw it coming down the street.
Go on back to the hotel.
Is that a fact?
I hear you've been looking for me.
Was this -- "beautiful?"  Before?
What?
You want to find them.
What do you want?
We don't know that --
Who?
The more we plant, the more that'll grow, and the happier --
Need some gas?
Please.
I'm am architect.  I'm working on a site back in --
I'll have to go to a new school -- again.
Which one's that?  The dull, red one.
That's Ed.  Ed works with the Bell Telephone switching division.
I left it at work.
You know, it really is beautiful up there.  Let me show you.  We'll take a walk after dinner.
What did he talk to you about?
Hello, this is Ms. Magnuson speaking.
Yes, I do, Mr. Gardner.
About what?
Children often have trouble adjusting to a new school.
Why not?  Moving is hard for anybody.  Was it hard for you to leave all your friends?
This is where it was -- the tunnel opening.
Who are you calling?
What is it?
What do you think he saw?  Could it have been something from the air base?
It's all this moving from place to place.  We're never settled.  I'm having nightmares myself.
Ms. Magnuson, is Jimmy Gardner with you?
Jimmy's father is on the phone.  I wonder if you'd take the call.
I wish I could do more but we're moving out.
This could be our last night on Earth. I don't want to die a virgin.
You're being paranoid.
I want you to leave with us. Right now.
We're losing them.
A countdown to what?
Dad...
What the hell is that?
It's perfect the line is busy?
Pops, you're a genius!
What're you doing?
We have confirmed divisions of troops from different armies all around the world. Most of Europe, the Middle East and Asia are battle ready.
This is crazy. We're loosing our first strike capabilities!
My God, the Vice President and the Joint Chiefs...
You said you were on leave for the Fourth.
So, what do you do for a living?
They let you out?
Above American soil?
Mr. President, a real pleasure. They don't let us out much, you know.
See, we can't duplicate their type of power so we've never been able to experiment. But since these guys started showing up, all the gizmos inside turned on. The last twenty four hours have been really exciting!
And before here?
What do you want us to do?
Yes, but don't panic. Everything's under control. Have you... have you arranged our supplies?
What has the old fool got himself into now?
It's Dad's Grail Diary. Every clue he ever followed. Every discovery he made. A complete record of his search for the Holy Grail. This is his whole life. Why would he have sent this to me?
But if you want facts, Indy, I have none to give you. At my age, I'm prepared to take a few things on faith.
The present city of Iskenderun is built on its ruins. Marcus -- you remember what the Grail Tablet said. "Across the desert and through the mountain to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon."  But where exactly?
What?
No, Henry. Try not to talk.
Are you expected?
An old man's dream.
What good is it? This Grail Tablet speaks of deserts and mountains and canyons. Pretty vague. Where do you start looking? Maybe if the Tablet were intact, you'd have something to go on. But the entire top portion is missing.
I usually don't.
You said go between them!
No. You like the way I do things.
This one. I think he's in here.
How did you get here?
It's ours, Indy. Yours and mine.
Dad!
Out!
Humpf -- so I was wrong this time. But by God, I wasn't wrong when I mailed you my Diary. You obviously got it.
He was actually there? You saw him?
No, Dad. You did. Forty years.
Rats?
You did!!
You're going the wrong Way! We have to get to Berlin!
Booby traps?
What did you get?
When we're airborne, with Germany behind us, then I'll share that sentiment.
Actually, I was a wonderful father.
This is intolerable!
The penitent man is humble before God.
Penitent. Penitent...
What did you find, Junior?
Ready?
What happened to Marcus, Sallah?
But, Indy --
Because you're looking for the Holy Grail.
Where is he? Talk -- or you're dead. Damn it, tell me! Tell me!
If you let me go, I will tell you where he is.
I'm sure that will please the Maharajah, Captain.
Interested in local curios?
The plane crash and your journey here sound -- most incredible.
Listen, Mr. Lal, what do you call the Maharajah's wife?
There, you see, Captain. A rock!
Next time I'll cut off more than his finger.
You got the tickets, Short Round?
You were caught trying to steal the Sankara Stones.
You will go to palace there.
You don't look very good.
What do you mean -- how?
Hey, Willie -- I think you better get out now.
Stark naked? You wish... If you're trying to seduce me, Dr. Jones, this is a very primitive approach.
Me seduce you? Honey, you're the one who took your clothes off.  I just came over to remind you that you never know what else might be in the water.
It's starting to let go!
Is that what you're hoping to find at this palace, Dr. Jones?
You're nice. Listen, I'm taking applications -- how'd you like to be my palace slave?
What're we going to do?!
You didn't do so well yourself. Finding that stone could've gotten you all the fortune and glory you were talking about.
I said something.
...reporting....him... ventriloquism...On a bus
What street?
You're in my head, you can talk to me and hear what I say, but you can't see anything.
Right.
It's my head, I'll be the judge of that. Anyway, who are you?
Yeah. What did you do? You explain it. ...why I'm not at the lab right now, in my tube, with my crew. Explain that!
I don't know what you're talking about.
You've heard of U.S.T.?
You're not crazy.
I'll talk to them.
We're a team...My...talent. Your... mobility.
They'll have to take you apart. ...piece by piece.
We have to get out of here.
Go out, take your first left.
Which way do I go?
A lab and equipment.
That's not a good idea.
You do. To get out of here. You're gonna be me.
I'm back.
Who is it?
It's just not enough.
How else do you get seaweed under your nails?
Holy shit!
Now what?
Beautiful!
Yeah. I did it.
You want sophistication, it don't come cheap.
Which one is she?
Pan the group, will you. If you're right, at least one of them...is involved.
Just don't show fear.
Maybe she's telling the truth.
What is it, your charm?
Oh come on.
You found her.
Yeah...You've fallen for her.
Never mind, just say it.
He was with Gruner!
You sure this will work?
haka xuki. What's that mean?
He hung us up dry.
Then, why'd he lead us here.
The man we want has the PEM, and is across the border by now.
This may hurt.
Do something.
You were the one who was always suspicious of her!
I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done.
Don't worry, I owe you a lot. I'm not gonna let us rot here. I'm gonna find us a way out.
In a way, we're like brothers... I can't have her. I want you to.
JOE What abilities...?
Nice?
It's a long story.
I knew he was following us. He diverted attention, exposed Ryuji's trap..
If there is a POD inside him, We'll find it, and bring it out for study.
You've cut your hair?
Surveillance Cameras?
They took the tapes.
We'll have to let them go.
Bit expensive, sir.
Yes?
It is to me too.
And how do you service foreigners.
Now remember, your short term memory may have been affected.
I don't know...the last couple of hours...last few days.
Why don't you lie down until you feel better.
Been complaning of hallucinations.
Not...complaining, actually.
That Rene...lovely girl...a killer!
Don't do it!
How's that for fucking Savoir Fair!
Nothing.
What do you do about what?
Is someone else here?
I'll be right there.
Nothing...Al. Why do you talk   that way?
If I was with you, I wouldn't
...Ummm, you really work for the foreign service?
Is that Ryuji?
No. Ryuji just hires us.
Why did you leave?
I don't know, Ryuji said there was a change of plans.
Hiroshima.
Lots of my clients are rich guys... They like danger..like playing with drugs and things...running around, acting mysterious.
What's Gruner like?
What?
Yes. No. I'm...okay. They can't do this. They can't hold us here.
What? Oh, about Dieter, Yes. It was him. Gruner works for him.
What?
They can hold us here forever. Nobody knows about us.
I'll come back for you.
Doesn't matter. I'm on your side.
He told me what to do.
Why are you on to him?
Joe Doakes? It's quarter to 10...
Is there anything else?
Water fountain's through that door, down the hall.
Why not?
I can't get it out. It would take hours.
This the only spare?
It doesn't hurt.
Hi, Daddy.
Ms. Laufer gave me a star today.
Yes, baby?
We'll give you a heads up before we launch.
Three hours.
I'm cooking pasta primavera.
Oh, no, of course they're not influenced by money. They work for free. And you are a Volunteer Executive Producer.
What the hell are you doing?
I'm gonna do a follow-up.
Is CBS corporate telling CBS News do not go to air with this story?
Hi, baby.
Well, until you do, all I can tell you is what you already know... they will not air an interview.
Hey, it doesn't work? You've burned your bridges, man.
I don't understand.
Use the bathroom.
They're killing the Wigand interview...
What?!
"I'm Lowell Bergman, I'm from '60 Minutes.'" You know, you take the "60 Minutes" out of that sentence, nobody returns your phone call. Maybe Wigand's right. Maybe I'm hooked. What am I hooked on? The rush? "60 Minutes"? What the hell for? Infotainment. It's so fucking useless, all of it.
Oh, my God.
He referred to this... the Seven Dwarfs...
Thank you for saying that...
"Put the corporation at risk"...? Give me a fucking break!
Alright. What did you think?
But in all that time, Mike, did you ever get off a plane, walk into a room, and find that a source for a story changed his mind? Lost his heart? Walked out on us? Not one fucking time! You want to know why?
Tell him I will see him day after tomorrow.
Did work.
Mrs. Wigand, how do you do?
How did Brown & Williamson know I spoke to you...?
And I don't like paranoid accusations! I'm a journalist. Think. Use your head. How do I operate as a journalist by screwing the people who could provide me with information before they provided me with it?
You believe that?
You believe that?
Jeff...
I heard.
What?!
No.
Yes. Did you lie about being on the American Judo Team in the Olympics?
That's not the fucking point, whether you told the truth or not! Hello...?
I've got to teach class. I've got to go. I've got to teach class.
That's bullshit, Jeff!
Where are you, anyway?
What?
I can't say that!
I heard you. But I got to arrange a legal defense first. I got to get you to testify in court, get it on public record.
Mike's our Attorney General down here.  I was just explaining to Jeff, they got a Kentucky court to issue a gag order to stop his deposition today.
And that's what cigarettes are for...?
The straw that broke the camel's back for me and really put me in trouble with Sandefur was a compound called "coumarin." When I came on board at B&W, they had tried to transition from coumarin to a similar flavor that would give the same taste, and had been unsuccessful. I wanted it out immediately. I was told that it would affect sales, so I should mind my own business. I constructed a memo to Mr. Sandefur indicating I could not in conscience continue with coumarin in a product that we now knew, we had documentation, was similar to coumadin, a lung-specific carcinogen...
And you sent the document forward to Sandefur?
Most certainly.
"You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?"
It acts as a drug on the body?
Course I can't do much "wriggling" if you tie me up like that again. Massey -- this is one bad bad little girl.
Well -- at the moment, that'd be me.
What part?
I'd just like to have a word with her.
I am here representing Mr. Dumbarton, on a... matter of some delicacy.
Who do you want me to kill?
You want Botox?
I'm happy for you, pal.
What do you mean, was.
What is your husband's profession?
These are yours.
Oh, I'm a lot like you -- just looking for an ass to mount.
No. You listen to me.  You busted me, Miles. You left me with nothing! What did you expect me to do? Get a degree in counseling? Write a book about table linen? Because that's what wives do when they get dumped, and frankly, I'm not quite ready for that.
Have you tried the duck?
Marylin? Forgive me but are you -- drunk?
No. Don't stop.
No. No. I don't have a... no. It was from a client.
Me. Yes.
She never particularly cared for me.
And here I thought my mother was...
That is bullshit! Mine is a bitch and yours is a psycho. I can't believe you're saying this, Marylin! There's nothing wrong with us. We're attractive and charismatic and successful and... I like us.
No.
I have to say -- I'm speechless. No. I'm never speechless.
Huh?
Do you want to sleep on it?
No. Judge -- just a sec. But Marylin, if we sign it, I can't hope to benefit from the marriage.
Miles.
I don't know. Maybe I should grab my mace. I'm a civil attorney. I have little experience with "the criminal mind."
I want to nail you ass.
Hello, Rex.
He told me to -- he said he wanted me to --
Miles Massey.
Well what does he want?
Every week --
What about rugs? I thought we were stopping at Mansour?
Well, that's about to change big time.
Wait. I know you.
What?!
So, Miles. If you have a proposal, let's hear it.
Ha Ha.
Oh brother. Here we go.
Are you familiar with Kirshner?
...arty farty!
He divorced his wife -- he married Marylin -- he divorced Marylin -- and he -- remarried his WIFE? What kind of sick --
She's YOUR wife. Why don't you ask her? Anyway, I assume she signed the highly over rated Massey pre-nup.
Mr. Rexroth.
When I first met Marylin -- Well, we were crazy about each other. Not emotionally, of course. We just couldn't keep our hands off each other.
I know that sounds rough but I'm about to close on a deal to develop some mini-malls, and I'm mortgaged up to my ass. If this deal goes south, I'm ruined -- I'll lose millions.
Wrigley!
Ah, but is she richer than Mrs. Croesus?
Get me Marylin Rexroth Doyle.
She owes me a meal.
No. I haven't. But I've been out of town.  Hello, Rex. Hello there.
Who's "Patty."
don't know. I'd have to see on what you base your claim. I presume you feel you're justified in—
A normal human being couldn't live under the same roof with her, without going nuts.  She's my idea of nothing!
Come on, Ellie. Stop being silly. You know I'm going to have my way.
Where are you taking me?
You'll never do it! You can't do it!
Nothing much. I just think he's a fake, that's all.
might have been able to help if it weren't for you. I've been watched so closely, I—
Ellie? Oh, she's no responsibility.
Here's another wire, sir. This one's from Charleston.  "Checking every northbound train. Also assigned twenty operatives to watch main highways. No success yet. Will continue to do everything possible." Signed: Lovington Detective Agency, Charleston.
What do you think you're doing!
Oh, yeah?
Driver!
That storm sure made a mess outa these roads.
I beg your pardon!
Tell that man not to drive so fast. 
Oh, my heavens! It's gone!
Yeah. I knew you'd catch on eventually.
That's right. You didn't.
You're not going to notify my father, are you?
I just had the unpleasant sensation of hearing you referred to as my husband.
This?  Oh, that's a matter of simple mathematics. These cabins cost two bucks a night and I'm very sorry to inform you, wifey dear, but the family purse won't stand for our having separate establishments. 
That, I suppose, makes everything—uh—quite all right.
Peter Warne? I don't like it.
Here—
Why, you sweet thing, you. Where'd you get it pressed? 
I can't go out like this.
Hey—you're little, aren't you?
Very outspoken, too. Said I looked funny. Wasn't that cute?
Why, Peter! Don't you want to hear about our lovely friends?
King—King Westley was in it.
Um-hm. We rode around all afternoon. Father was frantic. By 6 o'clock he was having all the rivers dragged. 
Aw, now, don't you start telling me I shouldn't dunk.
How about Cinderella—or a real hot love story?
Yes, I noticed he was getting a little fat lately.  Ouch!
I was never built for these moonlight strolls.  Why did we have to leave the bus?
Yeah.
This isn't "piggy-back."
My uncle—Mother's brother—had four children . . . and I've seen them ride "piggy-back."
You're prejudiced.
We're not going to sleep out here, are we?
What!
Raw?
Something must have gone wrong. I guess I'll try number two.
What happened?
Haven't you ever wanted to fall in love?
Why don't you stay and watch the fun? You'll enjoy it immensely.
Eight o'clock tonight.
Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.  Here.
No, he ain't! And the car's gone, too.
If you don't get out of here, I'll slap that fresh mouth of yours.
Do you mind taking those things off the Walls of Jericho?  It's tough enough as it is.
Did you know he reversed the charges on that call?
Collect?
Get out of here!
Would an exclusive story like that be worth a thousand bucks to you?
Great!  But that's the way things go. You think you got a swell yarn—then something comes along—messes up the finish—and there you are.
When you sober up—come in and see me.
Blamed if I know. I just brung 'em a trumpet.
Yeah. You know, one of those toy things. They sent me to the store to get it.
"How would you like to have the story, you big tub of—of—"
Worst comes to the worst, we got his car for security.
Looks like it, don't it?  Here's the woman, ma.
Then—you'll have to git !
A gat! A gat!  Got any fireworks on you?
Why—no—
Oh, thanks, thanks, Mister. I always knew you guys were kind-hearted.
Well, what do you expect from a pig but a grunt.
Now that's pretty important, Dean. You also told the FBI when you met him, he was six foot two.  Then you tell the Commission he was five foot eight.  How the hell did the man shrink like that, Dean?
All this blubbering over that sonofabitch!  They're grieving like they knew the man.  It makes me want to puke.
I think I'll cut out here, chief.  I gotta get home.
You found out about Dave Ferrie going to Texas today and you went through all my files to see what was going on.  You're a goddamn spy.
Goddammit chief, why would I ever need to look in your files?  I saw enough here this summer to write a book.
I always lock my files.  And you were the only one here today...  What do you mean, you son of a bitch?
Frank, I don't want to hear it.
Correct me if I'm wrong.  I thought we were on the same side.  What the hell business is it of theirs to say that?
Shaw.  Clay Shaw.
Clay Bertrand, Willie?
...there were about nine or ten people, Cubans, friends of Dave doing some stuff in the bush with him. Place was a mess.  Dave's mind was a mess,  Y'know he had all those mice cages around cause he's working on this cure for cancer... Dave's smart - real smart - speaks five languages, knows philosophy, medicine, military history, politics.  He wanted to be a priest but they defrocked him 'cause he was queer...
Morning, boys.  Ready for a walking tour?
Can you get some sworn statements?
Where you going, boss?
I know this, Bill - Lyndon Johnson got $1 billion for his Texas friends, Brown and Root, to dredge Cam Ranh Bay for the military in Vietnam. That's just for openers.
Well, I wanted to make sure she's the same girl I sent.
You know damn well who it is.
Calm down, Dave, what?
The Fontainbleau?  20 minutes?
What about the mob, Dave?  How do they figure in this?
How could I?  Dave, as you know, President Kennedy was assassinated on Friday.  A man named Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested as a suspect and then was murdered yesterday by a man named Jack Ruby.  We've heard reports that Oswald spent the summer in New Orleans and we've been advised you knew Oswald pretty well.
But you are aware, he served in your Civil Air Patrol unit when he was a teenager.
Dave, may I ask why the urge to go ice skating in Texas happened to strike you during one of the most violent thunderstorms in recent memory?
Did you bag any geese on this trip?
Your young friends also told us you had no weapons in the car.  Dave, isn't it a bit difficult to hunt for geese without a shotgun?
Who was paying you, Dave?
I don't know.  Were you?  Who you scared of, Dave?
Did you take a good look at the TV when they had Oswald?
Then who killed the President?
Shit!  Forgot to glue this fuckin' rug today.  You know, at one time I even had a full head of hair like everyone else.  And then I lost that. That fuckin' Clay Shaw.  I hate the bastard.  All I got left is in his rotten, bloody hands.  He tipped the newspapers - I know it.  That's how the Agency works.  They use people, chew them up, spit 'em out.  Now it's my turn.
But you took his orders.  He was directing the autopsy.
No, because there were others.  There were admirals.
I'm going to have to ask the jury to leave the courtroom.
Dad, look what I drew.
No, you don't!
That's impossible.  You heard echoes ...echoes.  We have three bullets and three shots which came from the Book Depository and that's all we're willing to say.
Finally they shuttle him to a radio factory in Minks where he lives as high on the hog as he ever has - he's given 5,000 rubles, a roomy apartment with a balcony, has affairs with local girls.
The Oswalds are introduced by George de Mohrenschildt to Janet and Bill Williams.  It's through Janet Williams in October '63 that Lee gets the warehouse job, right smack on Elm Street at the Book Depository, which is owned by another oilman with ties to defense and military intelligence.
Well... in an investigation we're conducting your name has come up a number of times.
A Perry Russo?
No.
I'm well aware of this asinine article.  And I am thinking very seriously of suing this rag of a newspaper.
It says that this company has heavily Fascist ties to the French secret army organization that tried to assassinate de Gaulle in 1960.
...and that this company is linked to the Schlumber tool company here in Houma, Louisiana - which is where their arms may have come from to David Ferrie and his Cubans...
And if I was, Mr. Garrison... do you think I would be here today... talking to somebody like you?
Liz, do I have to spell it out for you?  Lee Oswald was no ordinary soldier.  That was no accident he was in Russia.  He was probably in military intelligence.  That's why he was trained in Russian.
Hi.
Tough day.
Liz, I'm really sorry.  The meeting went much longer than expected.
Only cowards make crank calls, sweetheart, nothing is going to happen.
I'll take them up to my mother's if it'll make you feel better.  Spend a week.  I'll change the locks, the phone lines, I'll even get a bodyguard, all right?  Elizabeth, get a hold of yourself.
I promise I'll make more time for Jasper.
Is it such a chore?  I don't understand you.
He won... and they killed Robert Kennedy.  They shot him down.
Bring on all the motherfuckers! Bring their college degrees in here! I got nuthin' to hide.  They can't buy me.  You can't buy me.  I don't even need the parole.  This is about the truth coming out.  You're a goddamn liberal, Mr. Garrison, you don't know shit, cause you never been fucked in the ass.  Fascism is here now, Facism is...
No one's trying to buy you, Willie. It's important to know why you're telling us this.
What's wrong, Lou?
Post Office.
Between six and seven seconds.
You know who the mayor was?
Allen Dulles?
Some people would say you're paranoid.
No chance in hell, Mr. Garrison. I'd be arrested and gagged, declared insane and hospitalized... maybe worse.  You, too.  I can only give you background, you got to find the foreground, the little things... Keep digging.  Y'know you're the only person to ever bring a trial in the murder of John Kennedy.  That's important - it's historic.
Well, thanks for coming.
More than ten years.
How much more?
Was he there often?
Clay something, that was his name - Clay.
Yeah!  That's it.  I don't know.  Maybe it wasn't.  I gotta go.
How many men are working with you on this?
I propose you accept an appointment to the bench in Federal District Court and move into a job worthy of your talent.  Do you have any idea, do you have any conception of how easily such an appointment can be arranged?
And what would I have to do?
Virginia or Elizabeth?
Virginia.
Do you walk home?
Well, the public attention it would attract.  And we have no place for you there to be safe, we're not law enforcement officials, and many things are at stake in this affair, Mr. Ruby.
But if I am eliminated there won't be any way of knowing.  Consequently a whole new form of government is going to take over this country, and I know I won't live to see you another time.  My life is in danger here. Do I sound screwy?
I'll call her.
That's not what they're tellin' me.
What's the problem?
Let me finish. Can I finish?
What the fuck I tell you. You don't hafta shoot nobody. Just hold the gun. They'll get the idea.
Well, if you owe me, git your ass in the trunk.
Answer the question, nigga. Do you think I wanted to spend the thousand dollars on your ass? Yes or no?
She wants to go back to work.
Can I have a word with you?
Oh, I wouldn't be so sure. What with all the cash, I think I could go with Conspiracy to Traffic.
Help us do what?
Four thirty. I'm meeting a woman.
Who put up my bond? Ordell?
I'd love one, but not there.
'Cause I look like I just got outta jail, that's why. You droppin' me off at home, right? There's a place by me.
You're not tired of it?
What have they told you?
I had 'em too. I burnt those two Starky and Hutch motherfuckers down. Then their asses lucked out and found that coke.
You mentioned a guy from L.A.P.D., but you didn't mention the Federal.
Ask A.T.F. They might give you permission.
If you're having some.
I couldn't wait till I got home last night and wash my hair.
Uh-huh.
The Delfonics.
I want to talk to them first. I know more now about Ordell's money.
He had his doubts at first. But he's always trusted me an wants more than anything to believe he still can.
How do you get it out?
It's very possible Ordell's killed somebody.
How do you feel about getting old?
Bigger?
"American President"
I'm old enough to be her father.
What're you, a bag lady?
He tries to act cool.
If I saw a way to walk off with a shopping bag full of money, would I take it?
What do you do when he comes home?
That's my job.
And is that it?
He won't -- I mean, he didn't the last time. He'll be expecting fifty thousand and there it is -- on top.
How does Winston find him if A.T.F. and all the local Police can't?
Tell him I want to give him his money.
Less ten percent.
He's on to a new thing. He's after a guy who owns a gun shop he says is "woefully and wantonly" selling assault rifles to minors. He says he's gonna take him down if it's the last thing he does.
Madrid or Barcelona?
He say is a surprise.
Look, that shit ain't mine.
He told me. Besides, why else would an A.T.F. man be after him?
This is A.T.F. agent Ray Nicolet, Jackie Brown, Ordell Robbie money exchange trial run. It's three p.m., July 4th 1997. The location is the parking structure at LAX.
The envelope contains ten thousand dollars. The subject will be delivering the currency in a...
You two meet?
This afternoon before I came here. He was with Ordell at an apartment in Hermosa Beach. I don't know if he lives there, but I can find out.
But she mentioned Beaumont by name?
What? To put one of these in my pocket?
You didn't. I would think with all this on your mind, you'd wait till after.
I got there early. I've had my eye on this suit -- Wait, let's start over. I got there early. The idea was to try on the suit, see if I liked it. If I did, get them to wrap it up, and change back into my uniform. That's what Sheronda's expecting me to wear. Go meet Sheronda, give her the bag with fifty thousand, and go home.
This guy with Melanie, that was Louis Gara?
I thought you were watching him.
Do you think I took some of that money?
Beaumont Livingston?
It looks good on you.
Well, then, why don't you be a good hostess and make me a screwdriver?
I knew it.
Let's get realistic, baby. Sooner or later they're gonna get around to offering me a plea deal, and you know that. That's why you came here to kill me.
Baby, I didn't --
I got a problem...
I bet you come here on a Saturday night, you need nigga repellent keep 'em off your ass.
Yeah, I think a woman.
I was thinkin' the Del Amo Mall. In the food court.
Managers get ten percent.
Uh-huh.
Sheronda passin' the money onto someone else, that's what the hell I'm talkin' 'bout.
Now, hold on there. I ain't pullin' no shit. It's my money, I can do whatever the fuck I wanna do with it.
She won't have no problems 'cause she don't know nothin'.
What does she think she's gettin?
Right, the one Simone gives me. Simone and I'll make the switch at Robinson's/May. She knows what I look like?
Where you gonna be during all this?
He thinks he's Joe Gunn now.
Uh-huh.
You're fourteen years old here?
With Ordell?
No.
I lived there for about nine months.
Are you serious?
Yep.
I still don't understand why you keep her around.
Melanie must be dyin' to see it.  Louis.
Uh-huh.
So you light, ain't you. You light about a half-a-million.
We went to the parking lot.
I don't know. Either she has it or the Feds.
What?
Hold on a minute.  Where you going?
Watcha gonna see?
So, you want a ten-thousand dollar bond. What've you got for collateral?
Beaumont Livingston.
I need your name and address.
Across the street a Great Western. It goes in a trust account. You'll need to fill out an Application for Appearance Bond, an Indemnity Agreement, a Contingent Promissory Note. That's the one, if Beaumont skips and I go after him, you pay the expenses.
I can see that. Why?
What?
Very first motherfuckin' thing they did. They see I put up a big money bond on my boy, they start thinking with that where-there's-smoke-there's fire logic. They roust my ass outta bed, ten o'clock in the morning. Fuckin' scare my woman, Sherona, half to death. She thought they were gonna take my ass away for sure.
Beaumont worked for you.
You want me to speculate on what you do. I'd say you're in the drug business, except the money's moving in the wrong direction. Whatever you're into, you seem to be getting away with it, so more power to you. Okay you want another bond, and you want to move over the ten thousand you put down on Beaumont to the stewardess. That means paperwork. I have to get a death certificate, present it to the court, fill out a receipt for return of bond collateral, then type up another application. An indemnity agreement --
You still there?
What the fuck you doin' knockin on the door like the goddamn police? You lookin' to get shot?
Well, bully for that nigga. You say she wants to give me the money, huh?
Jackie didn't trust Melanie. She'd already tried to get Jackie to go in with her, split the half million amongst themselves. What she did was take quite a risk to see you get your money.
She's been there since Thursday night.
She was afraid.
It's in the safe. She can't get at it.
You expect me to just walk in there?
It's the next street.
Yeah.
You sure?
Who is it?
Hello.  Hey, Jackie...  No, Jackie, I didn't get your message.
He ain't here right now.
Where do you want to go?
Are you all right?
How do you know?
Daddy!
Stop!!!!
You know, you got a strange line here.
Things happen? What the fuck are you talking about? They did something to us, Frank. We have to expose this.
Maybe there's a larger truth.
It was the window.
This isn't injustice, Mr. Geary. The army did something to us and we've got to find out what.
I am.
You mind? I'm eating, huh?
Used you?
War games? Thailand? That's not true! How can you believe that? Can't you see what they're doing? It's all a lie. We were in Da Nang, for God's sake. You've got to believe me.
He say what they looked like?
Turn on your right side.  How about the other "right?"  I don't understand you philosphers. You've got the whole world figured out but you can't remember the difference between right and left.
Ah, good. Now turn to your left.
She hates me, Louis.
What can I tell you, Louis? After Nam I didn't want to think anymore. I decided my brain was too small an organ to comprehend this chaos.
I've seen it. It's all pain.
I'm walking, aren't I?
Christ, I know how it sounds.
Of course not. You have all the blankets. It must be ten degrees in here. I'm telling you, Sarah, if you want to sleep with fresh air, you sleep on the fire escape. From now on that window is closed.
It's not healthy with it closed.
What do you mean?
Where'd you leave 'em?
No. The little one.
Eli. Why can't you remember their names?
The best.
Those guys tried to kill me tonight. They were aiming right at me.
It's gone to the top.
How high is that?
You're out of your mind. I'm not getting in there. I'd rather die.
Look at me. I'm ice cold.
Sam, Tony, come in here.
He did? When?
I promise.
No. I'm a marked man, Jez. I'm the only one left. I don't want to expose you to that. It's not right for you or me. Be reasonable.
Where have they gone?
I'm okay. I just don't want to lis- ten.
Then don't bug me.
West.
Don't be funny.
No shit. They had me by the balls. Next thing I know I'm in Saigon ... in a secret lab synthesizing mind- altering drugs. Not the street stuff mind you. They had us isolating special properties. The dark side, you know? They wanted a drug that increased aggressive tendencies.
None of us can remember that night. I get flashes of it but they don't make sense. We saw shrinks for years. But nothing they did could ever touch it. What happened? Was there ever an offensive?
Don't worry. Take it. It'll free your head. Come on.
"Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I shall fear no evil," but no one ever said I wouldn't be shittin' in my pants every step of the way, huh?  Stick out your tongue.  That'a boy. Now why don't you just lie down and relax.
I don't believe this. It's a miracle, Michael. A miracle.
I would have stayed there if I could.
Hot. Where do I sign?
Push 'em back.
Throw that torch away, young man. Give yourself up. You're under arrest.
Push 'em back.
I'm sorry.
Jacob Singer?
Paul Gruneger!
Nope.
I just need to talk.
Pull the mirror down on the sun visor.  Just watch 'em.
Oh God. I know. I know.
They keep telling me I'm already dead, that they're gonna tear me apart, piece by piece, and throw me into the fire.  I carry these everywhere but they don't help. Nothing helps. Everyone thinks I'm crazy. My mother filed a report with the army.
Jesus, Jesus! ... When?
On top of him?
Watch it punk, I'm armed.
That's nine to four, geek-boy.
You got lucky.
You got lucky. I could have waited until he ate your head.
Asshole that does not count as a kill.
Okay, enough of this shit.
Just make a break for the door. He'll get some of us, but that's the breaks.
Hurry up, guys. We've got the rescue ship on radar.
Sergeant? We thought you were...
Okay that hurt.
Thorgan, quit screwing around and come on!
Kay-Em!
As long as they're connected we can blow them all simultaneously from a safe distance.
Use the thrusters and you'll be fine. We'll huddle together out there.
Brodski I'll talk slow so you can understand me. She's thawing. If we don't get her to the lab, she'll die, and that will be on your bald fucking head!
I am a scientist you asshole! This could be the most important discovery in 400 years. Do you have any idea what a find like this could mean?
We need weapons.
Jason. He's what happened. Then Grendel hit Space Lab.
Kkinsa, Crutch is hurt! We need access to the shuttle's med-kit or he'll die.
What if you miss?
Hey.
Jason seemed to have the right stuff. Physically, anyway. Radiation, cell damage, didn't matter. He just kept going.
Rizzo, pull away!
You okay?!
What about the others? Shouldn't we wait?
I'm missing two!
You think it killed . . .  Yeah, I guess not.
You read a lot of Science Fiction didn't you?
YeaH, GREAT IDEA! And I'll keep the big guy distracted with a blow job.
What are you doing?
No.
The air's laced with type two ozone, it reads as a solid.
Do I have to?
Kay-Em, you okay?
Kay-em you okay?
I am now. I missed you, Thorgan.
We're missing two of the kids!
Now wait a minute! I don't think you should open that door.
Then open the doors!
Yeah, yeah if this is another ancient Farrari . . .
Hypothetically, how much are we talking?
Where..? Who . . .?  I'm alive. You brought me back.
But...I...400 years?
Jason? He's on this ship?!
You wanna die?
Listen to me. Please. Let's get off thsi ship. Come with me.
And my regular daily rate -- $200, whether we catch him or not.
How -- if they're gonna keep on breaking?
Why don't we go in? Get another crack at him tomorrow.
It's three feet deep, Martin
How come you have to tell them that?
Why don't we have one more drink, you and I, and then we go down and cut open that old shark and see for sure what's inside him, or not.
Martin!  Are you going to shut down the beach on your own authority?
I don't think you can appreciate the gut reaction people have to these things.
Matt Hooper, the specialist they send down from the Oceanographic Institute.
Why not, Larry? We could get a positive confirmation that way.
She's right.
Let's all get out of here, this place stinks.
He lost it on the way up.
We have got to close the beaches. We have got to get someone to kill the shark, we need non-corrosive mesh netting, we need scientific support... It's gonna cost money just to keep the nuts out and save what we have.
Got a pen on you?
Drowning. Lemme ask you something. Is it true most attacks take place in three feet of water, around 10 feet from the beach?
About half of them. A lot of 'missing swimmers' are really shark victims.
Don't they have lifejackets or something? An extra boat?
I'm familiar with the fact that you are going to ignore this thing until it swims up and bites you on the ass! There are only two ways to solve this thing: you can kill it, or you can cut off its food supply...
Just keep kicking.
And nobody else saw her in the water?
You here for the summer?
A thousand apiece, something like that. There's five of us. And we each kick in a hundred a week for beer and cleaning, stuff like that.
You do this all the time, right, Charlie?
I saw a show with sea otters, and a big turtle... Mikey loved it. Made me promise to get him one. Will you live on the boat?
This is Quint, Missus.
I just wanted to know if you were all right... the Coast Guard let me use their radio. Is Chief Brody there?
Take my car, okay?  You come with us, Lenny.
I've been to sea since I was 12. I've crewed three Trans-pacs --
Anti-Shark cage.
20 feet, if it's an inch...
Face and head scars come from amateur amusements in the bar room. This love line here...  ...that's from some crazy Frenchie come after me with a knife. I caught him with a good right hand right in the snot locker and laid him amongst the sweetpeas.
I'm not hungry, oddly.
Sorry, Bleek... Going for my ultrasound. Gotta note and everything.
So, it looks like you're getting pregnant-er these days.
The guy is super cool! His name is Mark and he's into old horror movies and he plays guitar. I actually hung out with him today.
I don't like Katrina.
I totally heard you did.
No...
Yeah. That was me.
Why?
You know, I've been thinking. I'm really sorry I was such a huge bitch to you. You didn't deserve that. You never deserve any of the poo I unload on you.
Hey man.
Yup.
Just like our moms and teachers!
Nails? Really?
Oh, God...
A couple of hours? Why are you going up there in the first place?
You don't know anything about me!
It's called a spinal block, and you can't have it yet, honey. The doctor said you're not dilated enough.
Amanda, I told you to go to the infirmary and lie down. You never listen.
No Josh, I don't take orders. Not from you and not from any man.
Sorry. I was just getting something.
Juno was nice enough to bring this by for us.
Well, when you're used to the raw power of Iggy and the Stooges, everything else sounds kind of precious by comparison.
Hilarious. No, I just keep all of my old comics down here, and I want to show you one of them.
I'm leaving Vanessa.
What's the matter?
Oh, hi Juno. How are you?
Good. I'm good.  Did you finish that paper for Worth's class yet?
Wise move. I know this girl who had a huge crazy freakout because she took too many behavioral meds at once. She took off her clothes and jumped into the fountain at Ridgedale Mall and she was like, "Blaaaaah! I'm a kraken from the sea!"
Can I use the facilities first? Being pregnant makes you pee like Seabiscuit.
Oh really?
Oh it's just some stuff I picked up. For, you know, the baby. Babies need a lot of things. I want everything to be just right.
Oh my God -- It moved! I felt it!
You should have seen this octopus furnace. I had to get out my Hazmat suit just to get up in there...
Damn skippy, you're not! You don't even remember to give Liberty Bell her breathing meds.
Excuse me?
Bren took Liberty Bell to her tot ice skating class.
Yeah, she does.
I know. Women Now, I guess. The commercial says they help women now.
Want me to call for you? I called for Becky last year.
So, you were bored? Is that how this blessed miracle came to be?
What are you doing here, dumbass? I thought I was supposed to pick you up at four.
I know. Maybe they'll canonize me for being so selfless.
The Penny Saver sucks.
Touche.
She's gonna steal that kid for her collection.
Wow, someone's been actually doing her geometry homework for once!
Oh, it totally does. I was there for her birthday about four years ago and it was like Lipton Landing. But you know, boys have endured worse things for nookie.
I wouldn't be so sure about that. He did it with you. He's a man now.
Okay Juno, I'm really convinced.
Well, haven't you ever felt like you were born to do something?
What did you do?
Why don't we let Juno go home and we can discuss this later on, okay?
She answered our prayers.
Karma...  You know, if you do something bad to somebody fate will pay you back by something bad happening to you.
Hold still.
You shouldn't let him do that to you...
Do what?
What?
I feel kind of like the wizard of oz, you know when she gets the red shoes.
What if they're dangerous?
Shush, Adele.
...thank you.
...Mind if I hold that Bible?
Well, it's like this, Mr. Kessler.
Can't hurt.
This guy killed a mess of people.
Henry Lee Lucas. Well he was only convicted of killing eleven but he claimed to have killed over three hundred.
How did he get away with it for so long anyhow?
That bad?
Yeah.
Sure.
Wait a minute. You're gonna hustle me?
You two been busy in here.
...just like that?
You mean because I object to having somebody take off their shoe and scratch their foot while I'm eating I'm prejudiced?
Up yours.
How do you know that?
What is it?
Okay, it was a cheap thrill, it was stupid, I admit it, alright?  But let's not blow this. Not now... Let's just get the photos.
Carrie... stop it.
Any word from that gallery?
...never?
Darlin' you were 'bout that far from spendin' the night at the morgue. You understand?
You're supposed to call me when you lose your job Early. I stopped by the mirror factory today, you left quite a mess behind there.
...The police were way out of line when they stopped you from beating that bartender half to death. And no doubt God'll be pickin' on you on Judgement Day...
Hell if I know, crazy son of a bitch said he was thinking of moving to Texas.
Yes. Altogether.
Yes!
But then when she got into it. She really got into it. It was good.
Yeah.
That would be good. But I mean more like. I don't know. Like when I was having sex with her, I kept thinking how much I would like to put it in her ass. Just to see what would happen.
A little bit. But I didn't really want her to.
I want to knock her guard down. I mean there's a whole philosophy behind it. Having a virgin suck your dick, that's basic because there's nothing lost.
Yeah. The way I see it. My outlook on the this situation is.  It's like getting fame, you know what I'm saying. It's like, if you died tomorrow, and fifty years from now all the virgins you fucked are gonna remember you because you were their first.
You got any money?
You know like in "The Wonder Twins" they share everything.
Right.
Yep.
I hate this game.
I watched her eat the watermelon. And all this juice started running down her chin and onto her shirt.
At that moment, at that block party, she represented everything holy about a virgin.
She hangs out at Nasa. She promotes for them.
Why I do what?
Yeah. Why you give money.
Nah.
Why not? You stink.
Maybe Nasa. I don't know.
What?
Come on. Come swimmin' with us.
At the block party?
You should come back with me to Steven's house.
I just know. I know you'll love it.
Who are they?
No, Fidget, I...
Do you care about me?
Yeah well, it's been a bad day.
Did you and your boyfriend just break up?
I swear to God. Sometimes he barks. I can hear him straight off my arm. Ruff, ruff, he goes.
Oh hi Jennie. Do you want to come make out with me?
I know.
That's it. I'm gonna have to tell my little brother, I'm gonna die. I can't make him his lunches anymore.
And you don't get shit out of it.
Yep. That's the best way. It's that boom boom boom.
Its like. But it gets boring. It's boring.
It's not his fault. He had a hard life.
Yeah?
Yep.
Holy shit. That's all true?
Nothing. We just wanted to come by and see what you were up to.
Slow.
And we were like underneath the sheets. We were going at it like crazy. Oh my God that shit was so good! It was like hard...
I think you're lying.  That's what kind of problem.
You like to play games, don't you, Peter?
He says on the photo he'll call tomorrow at eleven.  Why not come back then and listen for yourself.
He says it's a game.  All games have a strategy.
All you gotta do is look at the map.
No.
Then what's he talking about?
We wouldn't want someone's death to interfere with your games.
I spoke to Jeremy.  He's watching Sanderson's kid.  Sanderson went out after the match and hasn't come back since.
You should be an actor, Frank.  You looked like you were really mad.  The veins popping out on your neck was a really nice touch.
A few people.
Did anyone stand out?
What do you mean, stand out?
Did anyone look suspicious?  Think!
Who is this?
You don't want to think and that's why I'll win!  I'm already two points ahead.
Hello?
I know what I said!  She looks just like...
If it's so important, why don't you just tell me?
It's you who's running out of time. You're starting to make mistakes now. You're wondering just how much I really know.  Just how close I'm getting? Well, I'm closer than you think, pal -- and I'm gonna nail your ass to the wall!
I used a variation.  You should have anticipated that.  Have you figured out the message?
Hello, Peter.
Please... wait.
I'll give you anything you want. Anything!  Please!
Yes, I do.  I found your file.  I know what happened.
What's this?
Feeling better?
You're safe.  He wouldn't come here.
Not really.  It's pretty boring.
Don't you have something you want to say to David?
Whaddaya got, Nolan?
There's no blood.  Where's the fuckin' blood?
How long she been dead?
Only that you wanted someone from the institute to talk to Sanderson for some case you're working on.  What'd he do?
We're not sure.
Kathy?
That would indicate he's playing out a fantasy.  Power-control killers usually fantasize about their actions long before they commit them.  Once they become a reality though, they reach a sense of euphoria and need to repeat the act to sustain it.  But, in all the research I've read on Serial Killers, I've never heard of one moving so fast. It's as if the game is the catalyst for the murders -- not the other way around.
The most logical choice.
Did you see his face?
No.  He was wearing a mask... but I saw the cut on his wrist.  It was Peter.
I can't arrest someone for having a cut on their wrist.  Do you have someone you can stay with tonight?
I know you're busy so I'll get right to it.  Did you know her?
Why didn't you tell us you were there earlier?
We think he might be making a reference to drugs?  Miss Emma is a street term used by junkies for Morphine.
How can he be playing Chess with you? You're not making any moves against him.
I still don't see how he could be playing chess against you.  There's only enough grids on the map to be half a board.
I understand that this is just another one of your games.
Did you send the car?
It's a good play, but risky.
Our computer went on the fritz again. David came up to fix it.
I've always wanted to learn how to play chess.  I don't have the patience for it.  When did you start playing?
When I was very young.
Not really.  You see your goal and you go after it.  Anything that gets in the way is an obstacle and must be destroyed.
Sounds very violent.
It is.
It wasn't intentional.
That's not fair!
I just wanted to know if you're involved with anyone?  Let me ask you something?  Do your colleagues know if you're involved or not?
Why?
But what does he mean by a fierce magazine?  Violent?
Because to follow the game he played he had to move to that grid?
Are you going to come tonight?
I got lucky.
It's over now.
I'm sure you are.
You're getting sloppy, Yurilivich. You're nervous?
I don't know how.
That's a better one.
I must follow the Slayers. They've taken Lyssa.
You have rope?
I can't reach her.
She was very faint. I was barely able to reach her.
From here, I must go alone.
Slayers!
Am I not beautiful enough to be loved?
I ache with it.
Let me comfort you.
You will not, then?
Not yet, my friend. It's your tomato that's dying.
Fame.
I'm not hungry.
Forgive me. It's childish to cry.
Go. I command you.
I intend to keep you alive, your majesty. So you can abdicate your throne and become my Warlord.
Would you settle for a boar?
Tonight and every night, my friend, for this is the second time you've saved my life.  I am Ergo the Magnificent, short in stature, tall in power, etcetera, etcetera.
Quell?
I am Ergo the Magnificent ...  ... short in stature ...  ... tall in power ...  ... narrow of purpose ...  ... wide of vision.
I'm hungry.
If I could wish ...  ... for anything, I'd wish for a venison pie the size of a ...  ... mountain. No, that's too greedy. I'd settle for one the size of a house.
And do you think I live on air?
Surely a sorcerer of the sauce pan can make rabbit taste like venison.
My spells always go wrong when I am observed. Be gone!
The one with red eyes was a Dark One, the other was a Cyclops, and it was not you he meant to kill.
They'll trample him to death!
Barak is still strong in the north, and Tendo holds the high passes. But the great desert forts have fallen.
The attacks are unceasing: by night, the Dark Ones; by day, those of our people who have sold themselves to them, those traitors who are called the Slayers.
For some, the lure of power is stronger than the ties of blood. No matter. I had hoped to have the wedding next spring, Lord Turold, with all the nobles of the kingdom in attendance. But Fate and this war have ordained otherwise.
A match for your son, I think.
Sixty at the needle, another thirty in the forest. Only ten of us made it back.
Such a vision will be opposed. Who seeks it?
Yes. You have left your place in the Needle. It is the time, then.
The Dark Ones will appose you with all their power.
I'll stay behind and keep them busy.
Could not. Could not betray the girl to whom I was betrothed.
No, she was not as beautiful.
You had left me! I kept silent out of rage.
Where is he? My son.
It is no trickery.
OK. Mister Stansfield, Norman STANSFIELD.
Yeah.
At a certain moment I thought: maybe Leon would like working on his own? So he makes some little extras?
Pay attention to women, Leon.  They are dangerous, you know?
Why can't I have a bank account?
Why don't you take me with you?... I'm ready, now.  You said I learn very quickly.
...You can leave whenever you want. I don't refrain you.
Not taken.
What?
I love you so much, Leon.
...That's awful.  I hope you killed, that asshole?
Why did you unleash the pipe, I don't know?
You say it just to calm me!
Good morning, Mister... It's Danielle!
...OK... Good.
Rinaldi... Rinaldi...  What region do you come from?
Yeah... And still in Messina.  He's my uncle.
No...
You'd better talk good, son, because, for the moment, I've got a quite bad opinion about you.  Norman smiles.
He probably just went somewhere.
This smells good.
We operate.  We find the artery in the brain and close the bleeding... I just did this procedure on a Senator and he's doing fine.
So what's the deal Maurice?
You can change.
Jumped where?
Well, hello.
You'll probably be bigger than your brothers.
That's me.
What happened?
When are you leaving?
Ellen told me that she didn't know if I loved her.
Pacifica, California... that's a long ways away.
Ellen got up every morning and went to the corner store to get me my bread for breakfast... Everyday. Now that's about a quarter mile each way... 17 years... that comes to about three thousand miles...  And you know what Kris?
Adelle told me, your writing is going well.  The Crusader for social issues and all.
Come on Mr. Parker.
There are a lot of people worried about you.
Where am I?
... My father.
Confused.  I'm not sure what to do now.  I'm not sure what he wants for me.
What do you mean?
It's yours.
...Noooo.
No.
Right, I'll get your door. I tend to fade in and out lately.
If I was I'm sorry.
No, just drunk... but that's OK. Where's your car?
You OK?
Thank you. What time is it?
I'm from the East. I went to college, did an arts course. I now live in Vegas. I think of it as home. I came here deliberately to carve out a life. I was in LA before, but I'll come back to that later.  The tough times are behind me now. I can deal with the bad things that happen. There will always be dark characters. But my life is good. It is as I would want it to be. So, why are you a drunk?
First. It's our first. I'm just concerned. So... why are you killing yourself?
Ben, why don't you stay at my place tonight? I mean... look, you're so drunk. I like you. I trust you.
How long have I been here?
Sera you are crazy.
Don't you like me, Ben?
Want a drink? Great nap. Wanna go out tonight?
I like women who wear mismatched earrings.
That's impressive. How did you do that?
I don't understand any of that.
Yes... I'll give you that.
Shall we go away for a couple of days?
Let's stay for a while.
What did they look like?
You have been lonely?
A full night on the street and this is all?
Go, Sera.  Go. Stay at home. I will call you tomorrow.
Yes, but your major is Fashion Merchandising. Harvard won't be impressed that you aced "History of Lycra". What are your backups?
I can't tell you.
Go to hell.
No.
Uh, yeah, because the bitch shot him.
Okay -- Ms. Windham, when you uh arrived back at the house? Was your father there?
But Mrs. Windham didn't have a gun?
Did you hear a shot fired?
You're hitting on me?
What did you see when you entered the house?
What could I do?  He's a man who followed his pecker to greener pastures. I'm a middle- aged high-school dropout with stretch marks and a fat ass. Happens every day. At least to women like me.
Is she?
Look at him. He's still scratching his head.
Licensed attorney or family member?
You almost had me fooled.
What?
Yes, you are.
Can someone please tell Rick that he is not the only Sigma Chi with a big penis?
Donovan, Royalton and Levinson.
And D) Brooke is obviously hiding something.
You're kind of being a butt-head right now.
You're going to trust the word of a woman who named her child after a condiment? She's ly-ing.
Wait -- Hilary Clinton.
Is he the only one?
I did?
Amazing how?
You know -- mixers, formals, beach trips.
There's a pizza welcome lunch in twenty minutes. Does that count?
You're beautiful.
Now I am.
Where?
And what is your boyfriend's name?
I' m sure that was very awkward for Chutney.  Much as it is for me, hearing you tell about it.
Fool's magic.
Fire moat... why do that?
This is another victory, my friends. What began with the lash shall be concluded with a caress.
I like well what I see.  It pleases me.
I prefer a plump capon, but will happily serve you rats if they're to your liking.
I see...
You're a beast!
Might we watch, too?
And I with you... I never dreamed life held such pleasures...
And, now?
What?  Speakee loud!  No hear velly good.
Course not.  I no flum here.  I come flum Cathay.
You don't ravage the countryside, devouring maidens and burning the crops?
Baron Couer de Noir is a blight 'gainst all nature.  We dwarves be not fighters; still we are with you in this battle.  Some of our handiwork may be of assistance.
So, Jack... think you be a Green Man and not know Gump.
Oh, but you will be, Jack... Think you to sleep in a faerie ring and not spend the night a-dancing?
And how is it a mortal dare dictate to the faerie folk?  Is me music not to your liking?  Mayhap the dance of death by more your pleasure.
Didn't you now?  Well then, answer me this riddle and all be forgiven.
I'm honored, Honeythorn Gump... but no more tricks.
Why, Jack-lad, she likes you, is all.  And what hot-blooded hero wouldn't welcome the affections of a fair nymph like Oona here...?  If your blood runs so cold, boy, you be a corpse before your time.
Generally known!  What general ever knew more than to lace up his boots?
But... but, why?
Don't see why I can't ride, too! I'm second in command, damn it!
We must follow that bird.
Beware.
Better to kill than be disturbed.
Your imagination runs away with you, Jack... Those bones be but battlefield gleanings, like I mentioned.  A wee bit of carrion to frighten off the uninvited.
Easily said... the raven passed this way hours ago.
Wait, Jack.
Aye.  We be on a quest to set the world aright --
Don't like the feel of it, Jack.
Give in to despair and all is lost.
There's more than one way to spring a trap.
Defend ourselves.  We've bested far worse already.
One more turn...
Never show mercy!
I've not heard a note out of you.
Were the Princess Lili to join me I would sing till my lungs burst!
Where?
Keep me belly full, Jack.  Kill us another worm.
We seek to undo the curse.
Look at that shot!  Three at once! I can't miss!
Liar!
Oh, dear.
Not if you be chaste.  Tis an awesome test of virginity.
How bad was the unicorn's wound?
Sunlight?
I can't have been under much more than a minute.
Nor can I.  Damn!  It's buzzing all around me.  Ouch!  I can hear it like a fly trapped inside my ear... Says its name is Oona!
Grand champion, is it?  And what great cause leads you to me?
Is she fair, this princess?
As fair as me?
Courage, Jack.
And am I not fair?
Nay, Oona, tis not possible.
Uhm... fine work.
Is he a friend, then?
Plenty treasure inside... Jimmy seen it once.
You've been inside?
I wanna be with you today.
He hasn't called?
Do you guys feel like painting?
I put him to work.
And why was the alarm on?
You'd better call and cancel.
Come over to my house whenever you want. I'll tell my mom.
I'll get your back.
This is serious!  I don't have my license.  He was my ride.
It means I'm gonna shampoo my hair and stay out of your way.
I thought I was helping you.
You'd hate him for the trick.
Where are you?!
Why is that?
And of course the Beck's, with the...
An exhaust system or a window is code.
What are you on?
Pardon me?
He buys and sells the world.
This isn't me.  We can show clients endless options, change anything in a matter of hours on the computer.  But you won't change.
Forty.
She's out with a friend.
If she's not up, you can use my shower.
Is Alyssa here?
Does it give you some sort of perverse pleasure to expose your...penis in plain view of my sixteen year-old daughter?
The whole summer, man.  Party in Tahoe.
I'll ask.
I never said anything.  I haven't done anything.
Mom, tell him I'm not going.  You already promised me!
Are you totally insane?!
I hate turkey.
Why?
I'd blame you.  I want you here.
Why don't you just beg some money off my dad and move into something decent with a real kitchen and a real bathroom?
When are you going to be back?
Did you got through my pants?
Twenty years of hating what you live in...what you are.  This is the end of it, Sam.  I'm gonna build something of me here that I can be proud to give to you.
He's got nothing to do with me.
I wish you had told me then.
I gave up on you.
I'd be in Tahoe having fun if you had given up.
What would you be doing now?
To hide a black eye.
After everything he did to you and your mom?
I don't know what that means.  What kind of problem?
You lied to me!
I never tried to get you to like me.  I tried to get you to love me.
I just wanted to know where Mom was?
What are you doing?
He never answers.
A blueprint spool.
Sounding?  I need help.  He's cheap labor.
I did say he could go.
We're fine.  Turkey sandwiches.
What?
What have you been before today?
I'll find something that won't kill them.
No.  Why?  I like to be with Sam.
How much time do they get to spend with their dad?
You've never said that before.
Let's not do this, okay?
Don't move!
I better get the kids home.
What's your deal with Alyssa?
I wasn't sure.
To shave your chest?
We haven't been away together for three years.  What difference does a few months make?
You can't go with me because of Sam?
Sam is working at something for the first time in his life.  Once in a while he even talks to me.  I want to be around for that.
I was talking about our marriage.
Do it now!
You don't look like you.
Yeah.
You could keep it and rent it out?
She's doing just fine.
I'm talking about a haircut.
Crawford's are always looking for new talent.
Maybe you didn't notice, but this is a prison.
Yo, Blocker, what's going on here?
No, but...
Oh, she's fine. She's just not coming today.
She always said that if you were on the outside...
I got it... boss.
He seemed like a pretty good lawyer to me. His offices take up an entire floor of that big, new building on 125th Street, and he was using all these words I never heard before. He even offered me a job.
Ten dollars. But I need it to get home.
Sure I do. What's your name again?
What are they gonna do to us?
Yeah? Who'd he steal it from?
Don't Uncle Claude me. You get a load of those crackers? Couldn't be a mouthful of teeth among the bunch of 'em. Why you want to pick a fight with people like that for?
I said you're soft.
Alright. You want some pie?
Don't get all agitated on me. I bought a bottle of rum from a couple of dudes, I heard 'em talking...
So you made a generous contribution.
You lost all our money in a card game?
Pack of lies. Don't listen to him. We didn't kill nobody. We were railroaded. And we gonna prove that.
Cookie drew me a map to Greenville.
Yeah, I know what your saying. And I'm saying if you made it that far, they'd be watching every train that pulls out of that station.
That's why we won't take the train. Cookie showed me where there's a farm house. They got a boat there.
You want out of this place, don't you? Don't tell me you're starting to like it here.
Yeah.
On your behalf. What happened to we?
I don't think so, Claude. You'd just slow me down. We'd have to stop every five minutes so you could polish your silverware. There's no way around it, you're soft.
All right, man, just settle down. We'll get outta here, Claude. We'll get outta here real soon.
Hey, man, is Babe Ruth in the lineup today?
You want to hit?  Yo, Claude. Give Can't Get Right a shot.
Him?
It's a pardon from the governor.
My daddy died in prison. He gave up hope and hung himself. What you're talking about is the same damn thing. That ain't how I'm going.
Excuse me? Are you talking to me?
You and Wilkins sure are getting chummy. You two planning on going steady, or something?
What the hell are you doing?
This boat's gonna sail without you, too. I don't care if I last one day out here. At least it's one day of freedom. Now gimme those keys.
No, I'm gonna kill him --
An erection, huh? Haven't had one of those in a while.
Don't tell me, I don't want to hear it. It's probably all fucked up, anyway.
Too hot, huh? Well, you tell that lazy jiggaboo the state of Mississippi ain't interested in his meteorological assessments.
What do you think about that?
Just like Elvis.
Don't cry, mama. This place ain't so bad as it looks. Sure, we work hard, but there's plenty fresh air and sunshine... And you know something else, I've taken to going to church regular. They got services every Sunday right there in the mess hall.
Don't say that, Rayford. Don't ever say that. He gave up hope. That's where you gotta be different.
Wait for the firemen!
If you don't mind my saying, you seem mighty familiar with your house boy.
Respect? Well, isn't that progressive.
What's your name?
Me? Willie Long.
Goldmouth? They say he was born out back behind the shithouse. That's what they say.
Alright Willie, I think I got everything. I'll talk to Dillard, see if I can get up to the infirmary and check up on you. Make sure they're changing your diapers regular.
I'm interested. Keep talking.
Understood.
I'll take the little choirboy, if you don't mind.
Could you concentrate for five seconds?
You saying we go up there and kill everyone?
Well, we must get people sinning if we want to fill up our New Hell. How are things going down at City Hall?
Thank you, Nicky. Cause now I'm gonna bust Adrian's head wide open.
Oh. My. God. I can't believe you're here. Welcome. Can I just tell you, I am so excited right now.
Try an angel.
Where did you meet my father?
You're on Earth now, kid. Gonna have the same physical needs and limitations a human has. We'll stop by K-mart. Get you some warm clothes.
So far, so good. Now what?
All that running and chasing is making the sleep thing want to come early.
I seem to be in trouble, Beefy.
C'mon, man, I'm just asking for one Superbowl ring.
Don't worry about coming up with anything. It's cool.
Who is this, Metal-lick-a?
This is bad, Nicky.
That's a train, son. Don't stand in front of them.
Dad, Adrian's got the whole city after me. He's always a step ahead. What am I gonna do?
I'm lucky to get away with just the head boobs, right?
Nothing's getting through that. The fire is solid as a rock.
So I followed him...
The South.
It's freezing my hands.
I'd love to have a dog. But I go to school full time. It wouldn't be fair to the dog.
School?
Valerie, it feels like there's a bunch of butterflies flapping around in my stomach. Is that normal?
Thanks much. You know what's nice about you, Valerie?
I never thought I'd ever see Ozzy live until he was dead.  Please tell me you like metal.
Don't do it.
Do me.
Yes. What is rent?
Why is that funny?
A black guy?
Fourteen? Fifteen? Your days are running out. How long can you last? A year. Six months?  What happens when you're sixteen and you go green?
You know about Sanctuary! I know you do! You have to help us! You don't have a choice! It isn't your decision!! Tell us.
There must be somebody else up here. I can't believe that he's --
Had enough?
I don't know what makes you so curious. You have any idea who his seed-mother was?
What the hell took you so long?
Did you ever see anybody renew?
Anybody we know?
It has nothing to do with you.
He's the one. You too. I remember. He was in a hurry. Just a face job. Dark hair, I said. Then he killed Doc and you grabbed me -- and the machine blew up and I ran... I ran.
He was killed.
But you put yourself on the circuit!
You could have called me yourself.
Maybe... sure...
Both... running's what I'm interested in.
And then you killed him, right?
I'd rather be with you.
I'm ashamed. I was bringing you to be killed.
Where? Sanctuary? Can you take me there?
He's good, isn't he?
They won't listen.
Will you take me with you?
I had to. I did kill... for the first time in my life I killed.
It feels like breath. It makes everything move. Your hair is moving.
Don't!
It's getting dark and cold. I'm tired.
Yes...
What people?
Come with us.
A Sandman can get as sick of his face as anyone else. Where's the doctor?
It's all right with me. Is he here?
Is that really it? It doesn't seem very far. Will we be there soon?
That's better than gold when it's cold.
Thank you.  Tell me -- what do those words mean? "Beloved husband"... "Beloved son"... "Beloved wife"...
Stay? They lived together all their years?
Why not?
We'll see that the patrol of the house is doubled.
I was here yesterday.
Yeah, I remember.
It's me...
Meet me at the Starlight Motel on Sycamore... I'll be there in twenty minutes.
Pete... Don't...
Lemme call him now. Make sure he's not already busy tomorrow night.
'Cause that's how long it's gonna take, baby.
Andy, who is that guy?
Where's Pete?
No, sir, it's not.
Yeah, Mack?
Who is this man?
Something wrong?
Headache, huh? Too much sun, I guess. You want to come in?  Still got forty- five minutes outside if you want it.
What are you going to do?
Does it say anything on the tape?
Same one you were reading the other night?
Called? When?
I had a dream about you last night...
You're up early.
What's that? Another tape?
We've got to call the police.
What was that?!!!
Let's go home.
Andy's from Utah. He says there you have a choice... You can die by hanging or by firing squad.
Okay.
Her name is Alice. You know I love that girl to death. If I ever found out somebody was makin' out with her, I'd take this...  ...and shove it so far up his ass it would come out his mouth... Then you know what?...
Hello.
No. No, I don't.
Nothin'... You want to go for a drive?
I don't know.
Sheila, what is it?... What are you doin' here?
Well, there's certainly nothing wrong with that meal!
What about those men we met this morning?
Yes, it just shows—  I don't know why I'm talking to you. I don't know you. Who are you?
I beg your pardon.
Will you stop squawking!
I'm thinking.
No kidding?
Yes.
You know, that's what makes the whole thing so funny. A guy like me starts out in life as a plumber - an ordinary, everyday, slew-footed plumber - and by the use of a little brains, mind you, he builds up a gigantic institution, employs thousands of people, becomes a great civic leader. And then the crash comes - and overnight he's the biggest crook the country ever had.
They're very nice people - except that they've got horns.
You were asked to have a glass of wine. Sit down!
Why? Why 'come on' all the time? What's the matter?  Are you going to be a fuss budget all your life? Here, drink it up! Aren't you having any fun? Where was I?
Hey, hurry up, you slow-pokes - I'm starved!
Gold. You were going to—
Pipes? Where are you going to get pipes?
Leaving?
I think I'll stick around. I'll leave with the porters on their next trip.
I see. You're afraid of going to jail, eh?
How do you do?
You will need suitable clothes for the journey. It is not particularly far, but quite difficult.
So there are others?
Forgive me. I should have told you it is quite common here to live to a very ripe old age. Climate, diet, mountain water, you might say. But we like to believe it is the absence of struggle in the way we live. In your countries, on the other hand, how often do you hear the expression, "He worried himself to death?" or, "This thing or that killed him?"
Your brother seems quite fascinated by her.
Leave Shangri-La! That's not likely. You couldn't drive her out.
No doctors?  That's fine. That's just fine.
You may not know it, Mr. Chang, but right here you have Utopia.[15]
Simply preposterous. Do you know what I did last night? Last night, Mr. Chang, I held a sort of a self- inventory. I said to myself last night, Mr. Chang, I said, "Lovey"—  Mr. Lovett! "Mr. Lovett," I said, "you are an ungrateful fool . . . "
The High Lama? Who pays any attention to him? The porters laugh at the High Lama. All they want to know is how much gold he will give them. Well, I gave them more gold. I've been stealing it for a year. I'd do anything to get out of this place. To get away from that High Lama - the one who calls himself Father Perrault! Why, he's been insane for years!
Sit here, near me. I am an old man and can do no one any harm.
Yes. She has read your books and has a profound admiration for you, as have we all.
Just what I needed too.
We've had plenty of it the last few days.
You talk as though you intend on staying.
What do you mean if we should get out?
George, what do you think you're doing?
Let me up! Let me up!
Something grand and beautiful, George. Something I've been searching for all my life. The answer to the confusion and bewilderment of a lifetime. I've found it, George, and I can't leave it. You mustn't either.
You've got to talk about it. What about me? You said they stole that plane to bring you here. I didn't want to come. You owe me some responsibility.
Oh, George . . .
Besides, I - I don't feel like making that trip alone, Bob.
George, you couldn't possibly stay here, could you?
She was kidnapped and brought here two years ago just as we were, Bob.
Where did you come from?
Hiding? Oh, no. Hunting - I was in the interior - hunting fossils. This morning I looked up suddenly—
We'll smash his face in. That's what we'll do.
In for what?
What do you suggest?
Yes. Hold this pigeon.
I saw a man whose life was empty.
A man whose life was empty!
All of it. Father Perrault and his magnificent history. This place, hidden away from the rest of the world, with its glorious concepts, and now you come along and confuse me entirely.
I'm so glad.
Perhaps because you've always been a part of Shangri-La without knowing it.
Struggling, why?
It's the most annoying word in the English language. Did you ever hear a child torture his parent with it?  Mother's little darling musn't stick her fingers in the salad bowl. Why? Because it isn't lady- like to do that. Why? Because that's what forks are made for, darling.
I've thought about it for years.  I knew you'd come. And I knew if you did - you'd never leave.  Am I forgiven for sending for you?
I'm sorry.  I haven't even got any cigarettes left!
Sir, before you boot me, I just want to explain.  I mean, okay, you got a goat-guy with a hook for a head...
Everybody, listen up: we've had a tremendous amount of movement lately. Be aware.  Be safe.  Have a good day.  Oh, uh... Cowan?
His physics are a little different than ours.  Don't worry
Cowan.  Do you ever think that maybe, just maybe, other people might be right and you might be wrong?
Dee.  God damn it.  I told you to go home.
This is a neurelyser. it was a gift from some friends from out of town. I need you to look at it.  This red eye here isolates and measures the nature of the electronic impulses currently in your brain.  More specifically, the ones -for memory, which it will then block.   I said I need you to look right here.
What?
Right.
So what's the problem?
I tell you, if we really wanted to bland in, that'd what we'd be wearing.  I think it'd be a good look for you, too.  I'll even help you choose a tattoo.
Why?
Something seem unusual to you about that?
If it was just a meal, why did they have so much luggage?
I dunno.  Maybe it was baby supplies, Kay starts the car, starts to pull a U-turn.
Something's wrong here.
And what's this ... ?
Jesus...
Jesus Christ...
After I got the shit beat out of me!
I haven't been training a partner -- I've been training a replacement.
It's hard to find.  It's an old civil war cemetery.  Nobody ever goes there.  So... what is it you say you do?
I swear to God, that was not here two days ago...
What is it?
What are you doing?
What a coincidence, cause I was just thinking about you, too, Jack.  Recognize this?
And I'm arranging deportation papers.
Nowhere.
Actually, yeah--
They're not even gonna be your enemie-a if you don't give that to me really soon.
What if I don't?
We're from Scientific American.  We read about your discovery.  We'd like to take a look.
Now, what are we looking at?  Keys.  Look at them all.  Why do we have them?  Mr. President?
What?
He'll turn around.
I can't.  I have to know.
I always wondered what the world would be like.  But now that I've seen it, I don't need to see any more.  It's all right.  Once I'm in the tank, I won't remember any of this.
She's not alive, but she didn't die.
Anesthesia.  Try to relax, John.  I'm saying I'll have to remove your eyes.  Completely.
It's all I could safely move.
We know each other?
I put you away --
Yes, you did.
It goes from the bathroom to the kitchen.
I can't even stand up --
The nano... what?
Victim's a white female.
And you say the third prevision was, what, a little fuzzy or something?
I'm fine.
Justice already knows.  Talk to me, John.  Tell me what's happening?
Stop.  Just wait.  Who's the victim?
You can't run --
Seventeen minutes.
You're kidding, that's today?
We need confirmation on the time frame.  Location still uncertain. Remote witnesses are hooked in...
The mall?
Uh-huh.  Jad?
Nope.  Somebody's thinking about this one.
The victim's name is Leo Crow.
I've got no address -- last known or otherwise -- no tax returns for the last five years.
Confirm with trig and image.
I'm sorry Danny, but I'll have to give you the full tour later on.
As I recall, they outlawed compression firearms in the District ten years ago.
It was Iris Hineman.  She developed the Precogs, designed the system and pioneered the interface.
Cops aren't allowed inside the temple.
So I'll be the first one to go in then?
Just a nickname.
I like you, Wally, so I'm not gonna kick you, or hit you with anything, but only if you promise to help me...
I need your help.
I'm impressed, Anderton.  You're on the lam, but you still got the time and energy to slice off a little jerky for yourself.
I won!
Okay... now let me time you.
I'm your son.  I'm you.
Where've you got him?  Is he all right?  Tell me, you fuck -- WHERE IS HE?!
How can you avoid a man you've never met?
The system would collapse.
I'm not gonna kill anybody.
That's all, huh?  Just walk right into Precrime, go into the Temple, somehow tap into the Precogs, and then download this Minority Report...
It's always in the more gifted of the three.
This is all my fault.
It's insanity around here.
But I also know why he married you: you're as stubborn as he is.
Oh, it's all my damn business now, Lamar.  Investigation of a supervising office for a capital crime falls under federal jurisdiction... so as to rule out any possibility of conspiracy.  He's my suspect.
I don't understand --
No, I wanna kill my boss!
Can't they shut that off?
It doesn't matter.  He wins.
What kind of cop were you before this?
That's why you asked to partner with me on this little sortie, isn't it?
People, if you don't let the spyder scan you, we'll have to come in and arrest you.
You mean after he lost your son.
I haven't seen him in two years.
Look, Bobby, I don't know what happened, and I don't want to know what happened, but something's up.
They were grabbing her fucking ass --
Do me a favor, Arthur, keep him on til I see what's happening.
You're Bobby, right?
I can take you down there.
Not on me, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Manhattan.
I don't know. Do whatever you want.
Bobby, this is a plumb gig. It's a bunch of young agents and it's at a restaurant. It's gonna be easy and we'll make a lot of money.
They requested her. It was her gig. Max put me on as a favor.
Will you cut it out! Get ready, we're already late.
Who's watching the baby?
You talk to Max today?
Well, that's not gonna happen.
You shouldn't. He likes you.
Forget Ricky. You should be glad Max got you driving for me.
Yeah.
How so?
Me? No. Not really.
It's fixed. That's the only way to win. A sure thing. See that horse. The blaze.
Pshhh...
I didn't say that.
Ricky? Ricky 'I lost the truck' Ricky?
Yes, for expenses and such. Now, you'll be contacted on your pager as to where you should go. You each have been given an extra battery, so there is absolutely no excuse as to why a page would not be immediately returned. Am I making myself abundantly clear?
What is it?
I already told you, I parked it for five minutes and I locked it with the club --
'Dis?' 'Dis?' You're not in a position to 'dis', or 'give props', or whatever your Real World sense of fucking decorum tells you to do. You're nothing. You're wallpaper. You're not here to make fucking friends. Asking a motherfucker where he lives. And who the fuck told you 'Red Dragon'?.
Yeah. I'll find it. It's in Harlem.
Spa?
We're supposed to meet him here. Is Ruiz on the list?
Sorry, man, but...
Thanks a lot. Don't worry about it.
Did Max mention anything about any jobs?
It's not losing record.
I'll page you.
Ask if he said anything to her.
I will.
I thought you hate that club.
I do. It's a fuckin Persian Palace.
Damn right, I have. You think I like living on fucking Yucca? We do a good job on this, we're in.
Fuck him.
I gotta pick up the baby.
Why do you always get stuck taking care of the kid.
I tried your ATM PIN. I gotta kill an hour. Let's grab a beer.
No, man. It wrinkles my shit. Let's grab a fuckin beer --
What are you doing?
What exactly did they say?
No. Tell me. What's so fucking horrible about this gig? You've been crawling up my ass for six months to get your name on Maxie's list, and here we are.
You sold it? I thought they stole it.
Motherfucker...
What the fuck is that supposed --
This shit's sketchy. Why do they drop us in the middle of nowhere to have the guy we're supposed to meet come meet us just to tell us we have to meet the same guy somewhere else?
I detected no vibe other than that Ruiz thinks you're a fucking idiot.
So is this the drop?
Why you gotta make everything difficult?
Where do you think you're going?
Fuck you. Go then. I'm taking the car.
Do not put this on Ruiz's tab. Start a new one.
C'mon, man...
Hey, Jimmy, where they taking us?
Let's do it.
We don't need guns.
You wanna see how fast I get a gun?
Eighty.
I fucking vouched for you. I vouched for you and you fucked me.
Ricky. I'm trying to save this money. Understand? I'm trying to make it so my girlfriend doesn't have to grind her ass into other men's erections so her daughter can go to private school.
Don't fuck around. You're gonna get us all killed.
Look. They're together. You telling me this ain't a set-up?
Holy shit. Get me back to Manhattan.
And you grew up in Manhattan?
He's on the list.
What's up, man.
Excuse me.
Where do you live?
How do you know it's not drugs?
'Strapped?'
Don't drag my ass into this --
Why? What I say bad?
See you later.
Well, he ain't gonna be around no more.
What do you want?
A little Charlie, perhaps.
Coke?
No, really, mate?
Come, now. You just got here.
The Soho Grand?
Yeah. Grab one of the cards behind you. Call that number. It's my cell.
Thanks.
She poured it for --
Well, that's news to me. The name's Tom.
I done told the man what he could do with his train.
Yeah. I got a couple a new angles ain't been figured yet. All I need's a stake and a  chance --
The dirty yellow rat bastard.
Who the hell are you?
The question is, who are you? You are in the darkness, but it's not your fault. Elijah Muhammad can bring you into the light.
What's he gonna do to me he ain't already done?
That's bullshit. That's a white man's book. Ain't all these white man's books?
Look 'em up and and out what they mean.
A black man playing big league ball is something.
Allah has sent us a prophet, a black man named Elijah Muhammad. For if God is black, Malcolm --
-- the hardest and the greatest.
For evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt, implore His forgiveness, is the hardest thing on earth --
I want to, Bembry, but I can't.
"I'm telling you God's words, not to hustle."
Let's talk about you for a change.
Are you?
It won't be easy.
There are always slanders, always lies. You're reading the devil's lies. Can't you see they're trying to bring us down, bring down the Messenger.
To Bembry? Is Bembry your friend?
Do you know what Bembry is doing? You're so blind, everyone can see this but you!!!
What do you want me to do?
Shhh!
So now we have no opening speaker? Why wasn't I informed last night?
I assumed...
Is my family here yet?
That's right.
I told you we don't know for certain.
Yes, sir, I did.
I say a lot of things.
'Bout every other night, Red.
Is she hooking?
'Lo. I've got to freshen up.
Well, all right, then.
I got to hand it to you, Homey. That's the best preacher hype I ever did hear.
You want to be the head man?
That's right.
Who the hell are they?
Brother Minister he often talked about you. He loves you, loves you like his own son. Says you are the best, his greatest Minister but that someday you would leave him and turn against him.
Are you sure?
What am I doing here?
It galls me to watch you. You can do as much in days as I can in years. Men like the 'The Dreamer' are protected. Out of everyone's grasp it seems, but yours.
My country needs justice. Proper justice. Gunning men down in the street only feeds the violence. They need to be brought to trial. Dealt with properly. Then people will respect the law. When they see it works.
[South America.]
[I'm on to Juarez.]
I guess that makes you the smart one.
Maybe I can help your situation and you mine.
I need something. Do you have banking connections?
Another favor... get me banking info on Jordan Kalfus. U.S. deposits or withdrawals. Thanks. Oh, get me the same on Samuel Ramos.
[Who pays you?]
[Who's Tazinari?]
[She's late, Mr. Creasy.]
[Drive.]
[Do you know who I am?]
[The Ramos kidnapping. How did it work?]
[I see him sometimes at the handball court in Chapultepec on a Saturday afternoon.]
[He has a tattoo covering two-thirds of his back. He is part of the Brotherhood.]
[Please, don't...]
[I don't know him. I saw the opportunity and got lucky.]
Nothing wrong.
Oh, like you haven't been in worse places.
Not for eight months. I was in Columbia looking around, but, nothing seemed interesting.
How long you staying, Crease?
And what if, just say, there was a kidnap attempt?
I've heard of it. Never happened to me though. Maybe the firing pin's off.
Ein Klines Bisschen. [A tiny bit.]
In between you can take Mom shopping and to lunch. Does that sound alright, Mr. Creasy?
Being black, is that a positive or negative for a bodyguard in Mexico?
No.
Not at all?
Hmmm?
And don't start crying.
You're fast.
Do you think he'll come back?
Well, it's a sort of wife.
You don't flinch when a gun goes off; you react. You go. Don't listen for the sound; don't anticipate it. Concentrate on the sound itself.
No.
I dropped her at home.
What's so important in Los Angeles?
You think too much?
Pinta, we've got to go. Travel sucks at this time.
Don't be a baby. You're tougher than that.
We'll be okay once she realizes I'm not a new toy.
No.
Why are you here? Why didn't you die?
Where are you?
What was her name?
If she pisses you off, you get another one.
[The money, 10 million U.S. will be divided into two 15 gallon black canvas bags each containing five million which will be checked at the bank by the K&R agent. Then driven to the house in an armored car where it will be transferred to the delivery car.]
When?
I'm only asking for one thing. And it's not an extravagance. It's not even for me; it's for our daughter.
Our child's safety is at stake.
Creasy.
That's ridiculous.
[Is that good or bad?]
[Then what do you have to lose?]
He was doing his job, protecting the girl. If police were involved, you figure it out. I'm here for him.
Yes. But if I traced Creasy to you, others will do it as well. Their facilities are as good as my own, if not better.
Millie's been after me to fix her up with a date, so I...
Hey, Herbie...
I could see she likes you.
There's a nice-looking little short one for you right now.
Where?
Yeah, she looks all right from here.
I was gonna call that girl from last night. Take her to a movie tonight.
Are you kidding?
Marty, let's go downna Seventy-Second Street area tonight.
I didn't think she was so bad-looking.
I told this dog I was gonna call her today about two-thirty.
Who told you that?
Well, he died. You know who else died?
Did I tell you she threw the bottle- a milk at me?
Ah?
Catherine, you are very dear to me. We have cried many times together. When my husband died, I would have gone insane if it were not for you. I ask you to come to my house, because I can make you happy. Please come to my house.
Hey, I come home from your house last night, Marty was here with a girl.
Well, what Marty you think is gonna be here in this house with a girl?
Yes, I know.
I'm afraid of being lonely.
Actually, I don't make friends easily.
You got an elevator in this house?
Siddown, siddown. You want some chicken? We got some chicken in the ice box.
No, thank you, really, Mrs. Pilletti.
I'm stag.
I'll take you over, and I'll introduce you as an old army buddy of mine, and then I'll cut out. Because I got this other girl waiting for me out by the hatcheck, and I'll pay you five bucks.
I'm just here with another girl.
That means he'd have to marry the girl when she was one year old.
Marty, I don't want you hang arounna house tonight. I want you to go take a shave and go out and dance.
Hello, Ma, waddaya say, it's getting a little late.
That was a nice girl last night, Marty.  She wasn't a very good-looking girl, but she looks like a nice girl.  I said, she wasn't a very good-looking girl... not very pretty...
I heard you, Ma.
Hey, Ang'...
So, Marty, let me tell you about these nurses...
Hello, Thomas.
So what happened, Aunt Theresa, about the milk bottle was my mother-in- law, she comes inna kitchen, Aunt Theresa, and she begins poking her head over my shoulder here and poking her head over my shoulder there, so then she begins telling me how I waste money and how I can't cook, and how I'm raising my baby all wrong, so she got me so nervous, I spilled some milk I was making for the baby...
Because I called up Tommy's brother Joe, and I said, "Joe, she's driving me crazy. Why don't you take her for a couple of years?" And he said, "Oh no!" I know I sound like a terrible woman...
What is, Red, the intention or the act?
I believe it takes both. I'd have to look it up.
Epidural hematoma?
I don't know what else. You've been that route a little, haven't you?
It certainly isn't Henry's fault Hot Lips Houlihan doesn't like her name.
Must be the Famous Curb Service Whore –  House. You in the market Duke?
Well, there it is. Jesus!
What do you think of that piece of scenery, Yankee boy?
Jesus to Jesus and eight hands around! Duke, did I ever tell you how I beat Dartmouth by intercepting a pass?
Best equipped dentist in the whole goddam Army. Care to have a look, a man with your background?
How come nobody knows about him? And you do?
You ever caught this bread, and forgive our syndrome before, Duke?
Come clean with us, Frank. Were you on this religious kick back home, or did you start to crack up here on the post?
Well, Dad, we haven't found any holes in the large bowel. They've all been in the small bowel, but the smell is different. I caught a whiff of large bowel, but it ain't staring us in the face, right?
Oh, certainly, Sergeant. My name is Captain George Limburger, and this is Captain Walter Camembert.
We're throwing him a Last Supper. We came to invite you.
Or you can let him knock himself out. You personally'd be sending him to his grave.
I'm not so sure the goddam thing's in his heart.
Let me translate. I've had some exposure to the language. The young man is from Brooklyn and he wants us to vacate this vehicle.
You aspirate the blood from the chest cavity. Damn, there's more of it than I thought.
I don't feel anything.
What do we do?
Captain Pierce, would I be imposing...?
It isn't always this rough?
It's a matter of definition. Faithful in spirit, yes.
You'd think now, with only six weeks before they ship me back home, it would be easier. But it isn't.
Do you think anything between us could be impersonal? Or pure? You better forget logic, because you're proving why I shouldn't go to bed with you.
I'm fond of Painless, and I'd feel terrible if anything happened to him...
Why would he do that?
What did you have to test, for God's sake... the dental Don Juan of Detroit?
That's what you've been doing all these years with every dame you could lay your hands on? Repressing your real self?
Stop acting like a colonel, Henry. You know Trapper wouldn't sock him without a good reason.
It's a nice idea. I mean it has style.
Yes, sir?
Well, there's one big satisfaction.
The address of the N.E.P.H. and W. Why don't you meet me there when you're through golf for drinks and dinner and whatever strikes the fancy?
You're a couple o' sticks shy in your column, Ann.
Are you all right?
Action?
Yeah. No, no!  No! No, look. You don't have to smell the world! 
You got me.
No.
Of course not. He wouldn't be.
I don't care what they're forming. I'm on my way and I don't like the idea of being stopped either.
How many people do you think we've talked to already, outside the radio, I mean?
Yes, sir.
And, Miss Mitchell—I think from now on you'd better work directly with me.
Oh.
Wait a minute . . .
The whole town's in an uproar. We've got to find him. The letter's our only clue.
You made it up.
Our John Doe! The one I made up! Look, genius— Now, look. Suppose there was a John Doe—and he walked into this office. What would you do? Find him a job and forget about the whole business, I suppose! Not me! I'd have made a deal with him!
Well, you're catching on.
What's the idea?
Now listen, Ann—he can't possibly get in without our seeing him. I'm watching the side door and the Colonel's out front, so stop worrying.
Say, all this John Doe business is batty, if yuh ask me.
He's watching the other door.
Hey, wait a minute, Mr. Doe!
Well, sir, about a dozen families got together and gave Grubbel a job watering their lawns. Isn't that wonderful? And then we found jobs for six other people and they've all gone off relief!
No!
Sure. I remember . . . Say, did your ears pop coming up in the elevator? Mine did.
Yeah, she's a heelot just like the rest of them. It's lucky you got away from her.
I see. I'd better stick to running the paper, huh?
Only one thing to do, Hank. Drop the whole business quickly.
How?
Miss Mitchell, do me a favor, will you? Go on out and get married and have a lot o' babies—but stay out o' newspaper business!
If you ask me, Hank, you're playing around with dynamite.
Did you write that letter to Miss Mitchell?
That's a lie! Listen—don't believe what he says . . .
Were you paid for it—or weren't you?
Did you write it—or didn't you?
Did you want to see her about something important?
Well, I guess I'll see her at the convention later.
Uh-huh.
I know one way you can do it.
How?
Yeah, but how am I gonna get my arm fixed?
Have you got the speech I gave you?
A sea-gull? What's a sea-gull doing around the city hall? That's a bad omen, isn't it? 
This SWAT guy might be a good idea. He may be able to take a little pressure off you. I worry about you.
Speaking of which. I saw you talking to Ronnie this morning. Why can't you get it back together with her. You've gotta be out of your mind not to get with that one.
Fuck him. He swings at anything in the dirt. I could strike him out.
Fuck the stereo. What's that smell?
God damn it! I still needed to case that fucking store. It's too risky to show my face now.
They have less power over you if you look into my eyes.
Tell my dad I'm sorry about the watch.
The Old Guy? What kind of show of faith is that? I want Debbie.
...a car.
Did you check out DMV for any vehicles registration?
Yep.
I want a plane waiting at the airport. I'll tell them where I want to go when I get there.
That's not going to look too good on your service record.
It rarely has to be done.
They recruited me. Promised me fast advancement.
Recruited you from where?
Eighty-five percent of domestic disturbances of this nature end in murder/suicide.
You living together?
No, no, no...  She's from Hoboken.
We see each other every couple of months.
We need the 4 and 6 to finish to first and second.
The 6 horse is last.
We lost.
He's got the girl.
What the fuck is going on.
Maybe... There's one thing you have to remember... You don't create the situations. You can only try to save people from them.
Roper. Metro Division. Hostage Negotiator. Give me the short version.
Only that floor.
Is the hostage injured?
Don't know. She keeps screaming to stay out. He keeps screaming to stay out. We decided to stay out.
Maybe you should be.
It was my fault. I was right downstairs. I should have gone up with him.
Scott, You can't save everyone.
Oh, hell, forget it. This won't work.
You think I didn't need you?
I wanted to get this out of the way.
You got a bet on the game tonight?
I've been craving that stuff all week.
Korda escaped.
I don't think you're old and fat enough for me.
Scottie...
A deeper level?
Impound isn't a rent-a-car company.
I want to be put on this case.
You know I can't assign you to this. You're much too close to it. You were much too close to Sam. The department will take care of it.
Any verification on numbers.
What have you promised them?
System's running on auxiliary.  Only seven hours before it crashes.
True.
Why --
Do you believe in miracles?
Who are you?!
In a computer program.
But once the system touches the net, all links are severed.  Everybody dies.
But what if he doesn't --
How long?
New York.
Take care.
He had access to the keys --
You're jumping to conclusions.
You've got the keys, send someone in --
Christoph was in charge of designing building modules.
Then what's with all the staffing programs in his account?
Then you had her killed.
Why would I do that?
What brings you inside?
No.
Don't know what you're talking about.
Male.
Select uplink for Federal Communications Office.  Department of Enforcement.
The chamber has been accidently UNCOVERED!  You must return it to the depths. or  anyone should open it and Ivan is released!
To assist you I have retro-fitted your helmets with new Opti-Scan devices.
Be the eagle.  Be the eagle.
The earth was hurtling toward us at seven hundred miles per hour, and we knew at that moment that we were facing death straight in the eye.
As soon as we've taken over the world I'm gonna change my name to Sir Mordant.  Or how about MAJOR Mordant?!
I'm outta here.
Simon says...
That was a CHEAP shot!
There seems to be some confusion about your registration. I believe I can find you a place at the Ambassador. Many persons of the Jewish faith find it quite...
You own a hotel, sir?
I do right by Johnny Torrio and he does right by me.
Sure. What's with the brick wall?
I'm Bobby Clowes. Kansas City.
Poor, yeah.
So what happened?
Four-twenty-eight.
Shane was a friend of yours?
Who hired the bastard?
How much longer we gotta be shut up in this fuckin' sweatbox?
I think Maranzano's talkin' a hell of a deal.
Sure, Frankie. Fuck me. Fuck Meyer. Fuck Arnold Rothstein who's made us all rich. All so you can be an fuckin' honorary Sicilian!
For being a bootlegger?
Why do you bother with perfume when you smell like this?
Ya never tell a guy about a broad.
I booked passage to London.
Charlie?
I'm doin' business here!
So what is the problem?
It's nothin'. I'm gettin' married.
And if we don't invite Maranzano, we can't invite Masseria. Guys don't wanna be choosin' sides.
Your honeymoon, Meyer?
We got exactly two choices, Maranzano or Masseria.
I know. When the storm hits, it don't pay to be caught outside.
Tommy tells me that Capone's coming in from Chicago.
So fuck him. I don't care anymore. Let him come.
That little party's gonna make you a lotta money.
What are ya thinkin'?
I must know more of you, my son.
Then perhaps you need to know me.
Mussolini is raping Sicily like every Roman before him. So our brothers are coming to America. Soldiers willing to fight and die. Men who know the meaning of honor.
You get fifteen percent.
Your Calabrian friend, I will accept. At least Costello eats pasta like us.
Tell me, my son. Why did you go with Giuseppe? He's not our kind.
That's why I'm here.
Keep my terms and I won't be your enemy.
Masseria's been after me too.
Where's the stiff?
Sorry, Charlie. I gotta get my Johnson worked tonight.
Kill them! Kill them!
Jeez, Bugsy. Ya like ta scared the crap outta me.
That a Jew compliment?
But only on purpose, Tommy.
Now don't pick a fight. I'm staying over.
What's the maximum safe dose?
Aw, buck up. Have another 'tini.
Coming from you, that's quite a compliment.
Death! Thank you!
At the moment, yes.
Can you give me a realistic idea...of how long this is going to last?
What's the matter?
You're really gonna pop the question?
I don't want to be rich. It's just a trap!
I think I...I'm about to... Am I mistaken, or don't I get to... Is there some...
Guys, I don't mean to be rude, but I only have eleven hours and fifty-three minutes to...
Meaning me, of course. I'm referring to myself. You have to assume Monkeybone would be a pretty lucrative franchise...
You're wearing a <u>topcoat</u>, Stu. - Where are your pants?
Who?
I don't think so.
Nothing for him! He's being repressed.
Hypnos?
You can't do this! You'll get in trouble!
Aw, come on. You know you love me. You're a masochistic pain freak. You <u>gotta</u> love me.
Come on, pal! It was a compliment! You'da done the same if you had the equipment!
He's ninety. He's practically dead already. How come <u>he</u> goes back and <u>I</u> stay here?
Oh, don't you worry. I'll be fine.
I just need to use the phone, lady.
What happened?  Did you lose your keys?
Dating anyone?
What pictures?
You know ...  ... whoops!
Mother, I ...
If it's about the bikers, dear, I don't want to talk about it.
No, I had a dream about daddy.  Do you think I'll ever meet anyone like him?
Dear, I was thinking.  Why don't we go to Paris next year?  I've never been.  Your father, God bless him, wasn't much for traveling.
What happened?
Moscow.
Give you something to shoot at, Senator--if you figure on doing any talking.
Uh-huh. And where's the Press Galery?
And you say you never signed this contract with Mr. Allen?
Positively not in the station! Gone!
What's this, Diz?
Huh?
You know--little worms--ambition.
Kid--wait--what do you think you're going to do?
Oh--yeah--
Okay. So what? Stop worrying. I've told you--the dopes are gonna inherit the earth anyway--
Now, you've gone and let Don Quixote in here again. I told you to keep him out!
No. How'd you feel? Quick.
Again? Good idea.
Yeah.
Any time.
You--you've been a good egg, Diz. Maybe we could clear out of this town--get to feel like *people*--get the habit of lifting up our eyes-- live like we just got out of a tunnel.
Or angry little mountain streams-- and cattle moving against the sun. You haven't seen any of that, have you, Diz?
My first name's--Clarissa.
Why me?
You don't think he'd want *me* within fifty miles, do you?--after the exhibition he saw me give! Did you see his *face*--?
Not a word! Taylor's sewed up every paper. They're tossing out everything that comes in over the wires!
Wha--? Yes, sweetheart-- Wha--?
Yes, yes--phone, phone--  A--an outrage, pet--an outrage--I'll look into this--  Hello--Joe!--What!--No! Not really! Terrible!
Great saints!
Otis!
*You* tell Jim Taylor.
Terrific! A born stooge! Horace'll perform like a trained seal.
Look here, Jim--if you and Joe are going to gab about this appointment *any* longer, I'm going ahead and see those committees!
I--I couldn't, Jim. Those men were--
We can't help *what* they were! Forget 'em!
What!
Boy Ranger! The answer to a prayer. Manna from heaven! Didn't know the time of day--!
Not at all. I've come to pay you a personal and official--and I might say--a *tardy* tribute, Mr. Smith, for your recent heroic conduct.
Oh, now, I'm afraid that's been exaggerated some--
Aw--
Thanks, Governor--*yes*! Do you mind? His head--Ma'll take the tail.
He's the greatest *American* we got, too, Dad. Can tell what George Washington said--by heart. An' "Boy Stuff's" got the swellest stuff in it.
Here they are--I got them. They are all right.
Mr. President!
Thank you, sir.
His last fight was his best, Jeff. He and his little four-page paper against that mining syndicate and all to defend the right of one small miner who stuck to his claim. You know, they tried everything, bribery, intimidation, then--well--
Shot in the back. I was there. I can see him at that old roll top desk, still with his hat on... still with his hat on...
I mean, sir--if I'm going to stay in the Senate--I ought to know what I'm doing--at least, I ought to try to study the Bills that are coming up--
Thank you, sir. Thank you for your time.
Gosh!  Well--looks good as new. If there *is* any damage, I'll--
For a *question*.
It does!
Will the Senator--
Please, sir!--come with me!
No, Jeff--please--!
Oh, now--
Fine--
Just fine.
What is your interest in this, Mr. Taylor?
The man downstairs said number--
One of those sightseers--you know. You see, I--gosh, I've never been called absent-minded or... but there it was all of a sudden--looking right at me through one of the station doors--
The Capitol Dome! Lighted up!
You *couldn't*?
How?
Why?
A committee of the majority party leaders. They decide when a Bill is important enough to be moved up toward the head of the list--
Yes. House. More amendments--more changes--and the Bill goes back to the Senate--and *waits its turn on the calendar again*. The Senate doesn't like what the house did to the Bill. They make more changes. The House doesn't like *those* changes. Stymie. So they appoint men from each house to go into a huddle called a conference and battle it out. Besides that, all the lobbyists interested give cocktail parties for and against--government departments get in their two cents' worth--cabinet members--budget bureaus--embassies. Finally, if the Bill is alive after all this vivisection, it comes to a vote. Yes, sir--the big day finally arrives. And--nine times out of ten, they vote it down.  Are you catching on, Senator?
Yes. Shall we start on it right now-- or order dinner first?
--that's the main idea, Miss Saunders. The United States Government isn't going to buy or build this camp-- just lend us the money. You've made a note of that, huh?
Now, let's get down to particulars. How big is this thing? Where is it to be? How many boys will it take care of? If they're going to buy it-- how do they make their contributions? Your Bill has to have all that in it--
Well, anyway, it's *something* like that--  And it *is* important. That--that Steering Committee has *got* to see it that way. And I'm sure Senator Paine will do all he can--  He's a fine man, Miss Saunders, isn't he? He knew my father, you know.
No.
But you've had beautiful country all around you. You've just had to life up your eyes!
I never met anyone more--more intelligent--or capable. I--I don't know where I'd be on this bill of mine without your help--
Why?
No!
Thanks a lot.
Yes--right here. Just a second--  Miss Paine.
Wait--
Jeff--wait--they want you to speak!
Just for the fun of it.--You see the one that makes it back home in the fastest time, I am going to enter in the nationals.
And how's your bill, Senator?
It's just as well to tell you--because if we're going to get off on the right foot--I mean--in case I act sort of strange--it's the suit.
Well, now--I wouldn't know about that. Mr. President--what happens to me in the morning--I mean about my having this floor to go on babbling?
My, my--you sho' are pahwerfully upset, Mister McGann--but you' awfully cute.
What does he want to--? What's *he* doing writing a Bill?
Chick--
Let's get away from here. 
Tomorrow! Joe--he'll hear the section on Willet Dam. He can't be there!
Go away, Nosey.
No--I'm sorry. I merely saw him home. I'm not supposed to tuck him in and give him his bottle. That's McGann's job.
Oh, now--that won't do--
Yeah--I see I'm right where I've been for seven years--
Yeah?  And what else?
What are you driving at? You want *me* to get him to sign that?
*Me! Me*! I *still* don't see why I should--! If you love him so much, why don't you go to him yourself and-- ? Or better still--get up in that Senate and *fight* for him!
I know, but is it worth the risk of a scandal now that a new man is going to the Senate?
Wait a minute--Jim--you didn't ask *Smith* over here!
What do you think?
Oh, it's all right--it's all right. It seems a shame, though, to part company like this after all these years, especially now with a national convention coming up. Joe, I've put everything I have behind you. And so did all of our friends, but I guess we'll survive. We'll just have to find somebody else that's got a little more sense, that's all. In the meantime, you explain to Mr. Smith about Willet Dam. It's your bill-- it's your reputation, and if he can't find enough facts to break you with, you just send him to me and I'll give him a couple of good ones. I'm taking the next plane home.
It's crucifying him--!
I hit him from the floor with everything I knew!
Senator Paine.
Senator Paine will state it!
Since he was born.
They think he's pixilated.
He walks in the rain, without his hat, and talks to himself.
Sometimes he whistles.
Why, you own it, Longfellow.
I don't mind though. I had a lot of fun doing it.
Were you present when all these things took place?
But they did take place?
The Aquarium was swell. If I lived in New York, I'd go there every day. I'll bet you do.
What are they going to do?
Uh-huh.
It's wonderful.
You said I was a lady in distress.
What did you mean by that?
I've often thought about going back.
He played in the town band, too.
What did he play?
He did?
Well, here we are again.
Is he? Yeah, I thought so, too. I tried to laugh, but I couldn't. It stuck in my throat.
Oh, he's not getting away with anything.
Sorry, Babe. Sorry. It would have made a swell story. I just got carried away. That's too bad. So he proposed to you, huh?  What a twist! You set out to nail him - and he—
I'm having lunch with him today. He expects an answer. It's going to be pretty.
This is for you , Mac. The names of all the headwaiters in town. You can always buy a bit of choice scandal from them at reasonable prices.
Ow! My foot's asleep!
We've got nothing to worry about. He's as naive as a child.
don't want to be critical, John, but here it is—
Yes, I know. A week's gone by and we haven't got the Power of Attorney yet!
The gentlemen from the opera are still waiting in the board room, sir. They're getting a trifle impatient, sir.
Who? Miss Dawson?
How is this, sir?
Come on, John. What happened?
They say if it hadn't been for Deeds, they'd have gotten all the money.
Mr. Cedar is, and I haven't seen him in two days.  Listen, Cedar, we've got to do something about the newspapers.
Charlie, we're off! Papers all set?
Find out who wrote those newspaper articles and subpoena them right away.
Mr. Longfellow Deeds?
Mr. Deeds, does the name of Martin W. Semple mean anything to you?
Will you have a cigar?
I wouldn't worry if I were you. Of course, a large fortune like this entails a great responsibility - but you'll have a good deal of help. So don't worry. Leave everything to me.
It's merely a suggestion. I don't wish to press the point, Mr. Deeds, but if you'll give me your Power of Attorney we'll take care of everything. It'll save you a lot of petty annoyances. Every shark in town will be trying to sell you something.
Oh, yes, there've been a lot of them around here already. Strangest kind of people. Salesmen - politicians - moochers - all want something. I haven't had a minute to myself. Haven't seen Grant's Tomb yet.
Well, outside of your regular fee, how much extra will it cost?
Why not? Who is he?
A lawyer representing some woman with a claim against the estate.  Tell him to see me at my office.
That's very kind of you. Are you related to him?
Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington. Funny, I can't think of a rhyme for Budington.
Name your poison and I'll supply it.
What do they mean by this - "Cinderella Man!"
Well, that doesn't make 'em any less hungry.
Wait a minute. What does the Chairman do?
You see, Mr. Deeds, the opera is not conducted like any ordinary business.
I say we don't want to appear greedy.
Mrs. Semple is entitled to one- third of the estate.
One-third? That's about $7,000,000 isn't it?
Well, I don't know. I—
Mr. Deeds, do you recall forcibly ejecting people from your home?
Well, you'll not only see those, but before the evening's half through, you'll be leaning against the Leaning Tower of Pisa - you'll mount Mt. Everest. I'll show you the Pyramids and all the little Pyramiddes, leaping from sphinx to sphinx. Pal, how would you like to go on a real, old-fashioned binge?
Yes, ma'am.
South Dakota north.
What do you think you're doing?
Every man to his taste, sir.
Mr. Deeds - Mr. Deeds, sir - you really must get up. It's late!
I did what!
What two policemen?
Looking for?
Me, sir?
Shall I call the police, sir?
Oh, all the great writers -- Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, Moby Dick... those people. Each is bound in genuine premium leather with 22 carat gold accents. It's a magnificent set -- and only $33.50 per volume. Right away you get Great Expectations for just $6.99.
Doubtful. What did he say?
I don't think you know Dr. Sheeler. She's the other therapist here in town.
We're interested in any new therapies. How would you characterize your approach?
Well... you see, when I broke it off with Phyllis, she was naturally upset and she became more determined than ever to pursue certain -- how to put it -- doubts she's been harboring...
No?
-- I find it degrading. Maximum gynecology and minimum turn-on --
Uh, sorry, I'm going to have to...  ...I really appreciate what you're trying to... uh, I can't thank you enough for...
I think you'll like this. Know much about Cuban cigars?
Well, I'm addicted to winning. I say when you're in the red zone, you gotta score.  So what do you think?
It means absolutely nothing to me that so many of your patients have come forward with praise for you and your therapeutic skills. You understand that?
What?
Yeah... me you, too... I was at your house...
Oh?
I'd better get in there.
That's a lot of people all at once.
Oh, I don't know...
Four months, two and a half weeks -- that's how long.  And you've already got more patients than those other two shrinks combined.
You know who that is, don't you?  You really don't? That's Skip Skipperton, man. He gets himself hit by a truck, this whole town shuts down.
They come through a few times each year.  Hello, Mrs. Saito, good to see you again!  It's a tour.
That's it? That's what you're giving me?
I'm trying.
Is she a friend of yours?
What do you mean?
Why don't you tell me?
Well... you see, the problem is --
What can you tell me about this?
When did you start to feel this way?
What?
No... but it started one year to the day after my divorce became final. That's not too suspicious, is it?... But it wasn't like I was feeling bad about the divorce. Just the opposite.
You have the best answer for everything.  You seem so... hopeful. Are you always this sunny?
People usually have to get to know me before they hate me.
I've offended you!
I'm embarrassed. The list is so long.
No, not really. They're about the same. My marriage was one long headache.
You're doing great.
It doesn't matter. Go on.
...who thinks there's nothing really wrong with me.
And I'll bet you can interpret the whole thing
Then you can expect me at 5:30 tomorrow morning.
That's... good?
You're upset.
I think so.
But...
What?
...but first, you have to tell me something...
You got off easy.
What do you mean, "in no time"?
Weekly or monthly?
Pro boner?  Pro bono, huh? For whose good, supposedly?
It's my bit for the community.
If you don't want to have a session today, it's okay.
These appointments were not my idea, remember.
Okay then.  Have you got a lot of friends?
No... I've seen her. Good-looking woman.
Amazing.
-- Skip. Knowing what you do about me --
Okay... let's say that, for now.
No, Doc, a private secret! It's perverted, it's pitiful. What am I -- Dr. Frankenstein? Aren't you repulsed?
I can tell you anything else.
You were messed up, man.
Which examiner did you have? I probably know him.
Why do you like to fight so much?
Intestines.
I'm sorry, it was an accident.
I'm willin, to go on a little faith, here.
Don't tell me we gotta go back out there?
I wouldn't trade ya for a brass spittoon!
Yes and if you cut him down, we will give you ten percent.
Twenty.
You swear?
No, I mean --
What did you find? What did you see?
There's something out there, you know, something under that sand.
Preparation for what?
Something like that.
You can either tag along with me, or you can stay here and play around with Mister Maggot.
Got it!
Got guts, lady.
She's my sister, actually.
You did not!?... We're not!?
Believe it, sister. That's what brought our buddy back to life.
What?
Do something, Jonathan! Kill it!
The jig is up, Casanova. I've spent six months watching you, and know exactly what you're up to.
And then one day, he didn't come home. The police said it was an accident. But cargo containers don't just fall on people. He was murdered... After that I fell apart. I dropped out of school, became a mud wrestler, married and divorced a jerk. When my mother died I hit bottom... but then, when I was cleaning out her attic, I found my father's old bowling bag and costume, almost like he'd left them there for me... and I knew what I had to do.
Come on, baby!
But she's your mother. You gotta tell her.
No one will believe us.
Eat your mustard.
Yes!
Snap out of it!
I hope you enjoy these cigars. I had to kill a dozen Cubans to get them.
But times have changed, and you been in that bug house a long tine. I can see you still got the style, but I dunno for sure you still got the edge.
Against.
Let me guess... Bullets don't hurt you.
I hope you won't take this the wrong way, but I couldn't help but notice... that you're a dead ringer for Veronica Lake in "The Blue Dahlia".
Alone tonight?
I've never been able to figure out what to do with my life, which is why I guess I'm still a waitress.
Are you nuts? Get out of there!
What are you talking about?
My heart died a long time ago.
It is not dead. It is hiding.
Your Spiderman Pez dispenser! 
Cover me!
He doesn't miss a trick, does he?
Why do they always fill stuff these things so full you can't pull 'em out without ripping 'em! 
Why not?
The most vicious gang of thugs this city ever produced. Twenty years ago they were Casanova's personal bodyguard. But after he was busted they crawled into the woodwork.
Agents?
Sounds good.
What's that?
He's turned into a completely normal person!
Yes, Obie-wan.
Are you famous?
So you're like... struggling superheroes?
Really?
Oh hi, Mom.
Oh, who gives a damn who he is? I can't take this anymore. Night after night we're on the streets, busting our humps -- and for what?
Or Batman --
And there's the Sphinx.
Twenty years ago all the major hoodlums of this city were united into one great brotherhood of evil, and Casanova was their king.
Oh no.
We've got lift off!
Forgive me, Your Majesty, I am about to make it.
And, what a delightful idea!
Ah -- you approve?
What do you mean?
I don't even know whether a defense is possible.
Would you be prepared to handle this for me?
You realize what is at stake?
Paris has surrendered?!  I don't believe it.
I don't know the details of the treaty, sire, Marshal Mortier sent me word of its having been agreed to, and he said that I was to take the army and make for Fontainebleau.
She should have had Larrey or Corvisart.  They might have saved her... But why didn't anyone even write to me?  Can you believe that no one even bothered to write to me? Would you have believed that I should read such news in a newspaper?  How incredible!
Ah, my poor Josephine.  She was the most alluring, most glamorous creature I have ever known -- a woman in every sense of the word, and she had the kindest heart in the world.  She may have been a liar and a spendthrift, but she had something that was irresistible -- she was a women to her very fingertips... How impossible it is to believe that she is dead.
I have never heard an unkind word about her spoken.
Bertrand, sire.
She was sitting there... and it was as if I had last seen her only the night before... She hadn't changed -- she was still the same -- still completely devoted to me... and she told me we were going to see each other again and, never again, leave each other... She has promised me. Did you see her?
Four o'clock.
How did it spread so quickly?
It is the work of incendiaries.
Good heavens, Ambassador -- what has happened?
The Emperor has decided to marry your Archduchess, Marie-Louise.
Earlier this afternoon, the Emperor refused the hand of the Grand Duchess Anna, of Russia, and, as I'm sure you can appreciate, he is quite able to change his mind again.  For the Emperor, to choose a wife, is only a matter of minutes.
He said no one had the authority to rescind the order except you.
Does your mother know you have come?
No -- not as a rule.
Yes, I am, sir.
Well, it must be a good deal warmer than it is here on the street.
Would you like to take me there, so that we can get warm, sir?
Lisette.
No...
You would tell me, Joseph, wouldn't you?
The important thing is to find the right lawyer.  One who will not protract the thing indefinitely, in the courts.
Of course not, but such violence of feeling makes me wonder.
I have no idea.  Her maid said she left two days ago, to meet me -- I can imagine where she is.  But when she finally does come home, she will find her things in the street and my door locked.
She will probably appear with a dozen excuses and you will forgive her anyway.
And you, are you in love with any one else?
Promise me you will never leave me.
Will you be joining us, soon?
Yes.
But you will not... be safe...
I thought he would be seeing you before I would, and would give it to you.
Yes... but, first, can I say something to you, as a friend?
Why not?
Yes.
You couldn't face telling me what?
I wanted to kill him but Joseph convinced me it would be a mistake. He said people would say you hadn't the courage to deal with it yourself.
Are you trying to provoke me, monsieur?
Will it be possible to have my dog, Bijou, sent here?  I was not allowed to bring her and I love her so much.
Papa said only to comply with any request you might make of me.
I did not ask her to go to war against me.
Do you think Alexander has any chance to succeed as a mediator?
What I am talking about is moderation.
On December 2, 1804, Napoleon was made Emperor of France.  He would later say:  "I found the crown lying in the gutter and I picked it up."
Yo' cousin, Craig.  Hook us up.
And I can go free?
Hey, Debo, heard you running from a ass- whippin'?
Send Betty my love.  Boy you looking good.  I'mma take these in the house for you, man... and when you finish with this cat, come inside.  I got something to show you.
It's cool, but where's the water?
I don't know, I think I passed out or something.  I don't remember.
No.  Thought he was with you.
That's a nice piece of heat right there.
What's crackin'?
I know, we had a good time.  But ever since you guys moved out here, it seems like we've lost touch.
Joker, he just got out of the pen.  Li'l Joker, he just got out of Youth Authority.  And Baby Joker, he just got out of Juvenile Hall.
I went back to Watts to sell my old car and met her on the way.  Worst day of my life.
Alright, Roach, see you around.
No.
Naw, I'm got live ghetto fabulous.  make sure you get that car fixed.
I will.  When can I come visit?
Craig and Karla, damn that sound pretty good together.  Where you going?
I'm sorry for what my brother did this morning.  They're assholes.
You did all this for me?
Easier said than done.  We saved up to get away from them, but they followed us.
I got my cousin Day-Day waiting for me.
You alright?
What's the matter?
What it smell like?
Two bullets?  Yo' ass ain't changed. Back in the day, all I had was a stick.
I can't get jiggy with this shit.  Where is the damn manager?
Okay, sir...but where's the cover?
I can't give you your damn money back on this.
Craig, this Roach.  Roach, this is my cousin, Craig.
Maybe you can ask him to loan you the money.
And some rolling papers.
When my back gets better I'mma beat the black off you, Day-Day.
Debo!  Debo!
Nothing.  What you want?
Are you going to take me to see Mom?
Make sure you look after my son out here. Don't get him involved with none of your bullshit, Roy.
I got your message.  Where's Craig?
What about that ugly dog?
Suga.  Go ahead and get us something to smoke on.
Truth is, besides the headache I've come down with a little lower intestinal havoc. Make my apologies.
Aw, gee. I sent her on an errand.
Oh, San Diego? I've thought about moving to San Diego.  It's hard to make a living in this town. These short hops.  Can't make a dime on 'em. To LAX, Pasadena, then I can make a buck. These little hops cost me money.
Look...I've... I've got a problem. A big problem...
You were saying?  Your daughter....?
She ..ahh...wanted me to... be sure to get your autograph.
How do you know that?
I'd prefer we didn't refer to it as my last speech.
This is for you. In it there is a picture of a woman and an itinerary. It is her itinerary. She is presently - are you listening, Mr. Watson?
I'm not stupid.. I know how this is supposed, to work.
Do you now, Mr. Watson?
...twenty-six minutes to get your shit together.
What are you going to do about it, shoot me?
So, come on. You never saw us kiss like that?
Ready?
Will you promise me that?
Please...
What are you supposed to do?
Irene is going to help.
I don't know.
Hey!
Well, is it real? Do we know anything about it?
He's going to help the police. Your daddy is going to be a hero.
Close your eyes.
Why?
Keep your eyes peeled.
You don't want to cause a ruckus, with the little girl and all.
What gives?
No.
Icey, I'm worried about Willa.
About Mr. Powell. All of it!
There's a little peach brandy -- maybe a sip?
Now ain't you relieved, Walt?
Bluebeard!
String that Bluebeard up to a pole!
That boy's as stubborn and mulish as a sheep!
My, that fudge smells yummy!
I know you did, Reverend. Oh, I know how you tried!
Stand still, Miss Jenny!
Why?
Hm?
You swore, Pearl!
John! Don't!
Where are we goin', John?
Why, he told me what fine little lambs you and your sister both was.
-- and when we come back, we'll all be friends -- and share our fortunes together, John!
Nothin'!
Can I have my supper please?
Naturally.
Can I have this?
Surely. I'd like to talk to you, my dear.
Will you buy me a choclit sody?
Is there anythin' -- anythin'...?
Didn't -- didn't she leave no word?
John, Mr. Powell has got something to tell you.
You thought, Willa, that the moment you walked in that door I'd start in to pawing you in the abominable way men are supposed to do on their wedding night. Ain't that right, now?
It was with this left hand that old brother Cain struck the blow that laid his brother low --
Them kids is yours?
This man down at the Drugstore...
What'd you all talk about?
How can you tell?
What the hell's going on!?
You believe in the Boogey Man?
They turn their back on it.  Takes away its energy, and it disappears.
I guess those people don't wake up to tell what happens.
Coming up on the seventh day. It's okay, I checked Guiness. The record's eleven, and I'll beat that if I have to.  Listen, I... I know who he is.
The killer.
Bring him out of what?
She dreamed this would happen...
What?
You don't know he did it.
Then you know more than I do -- I haven't even been upstairs.
Looks like her boyfriend did it. Rod Lane. Musician type, arrests for brawling, dope --
Krueger.
Apparently he was crazy jealous. Nancy said they'd had a fight, Rod and Tina.
It wasn't that serious...
I won't.
Get into bed.
Great
No television, forget the homework, no phone calls.
No, Mother. Yes, Mother. No, Mother.
And no school tomorrow, either. You take a little vacation, relax and rest for a change.
Mom, I want to know what you know about Fred Krueger.
Bunch of us parents tracked him down after they let him go. Found him in an old boiler room, just like before. Saw him lying there in that caked red and yellow sweater he always wore, drunk an' asleep with his weird knives by his side...
And then what happened?
Anyway, I'm too tired to worry about the creep. Couldn't get back to sleep at all.  So what you dream?
No more fights?
Aren't you late?
I haven't talked to anyone about Paris. I haven't said a word.
You feel it, though.
And how is Lord Lavenham?
If you asked him why he left France I bet he couldn't name one good reason.
Yes! We could stay with Leon!
You know what they say -- there's nothing like home.
Monsieur.
Which lawyer?
Yes, Comrade?
Is there anything I can do, Comrade?
You might get me an accurate map of Paris. I want to use my spare time to inspect the public utilities and make a study of all outstanding technical achievements in the city.
Let's not close our eyes. There are many good things to see here too.
With our cream situation what it is, it is Russia which should apologize to the cats.
We are not only serving good food, we are serving our country... we are making friends.
The former Duchess!
Count d'Algout is still asleep.
Count d'Algout, there have been several telephone...
Oh, you're a reactionary! Don't you look forward to the day when you can come in here and stand square on your two feet and say, "Hey, you, d'Algout! from now on it's going to be share and share alike"?
Are they indeed? Thank you.
That won't help you! You can't intimidate us!
We don't blame you, Leon, but when we came from Russia we believed in simplicity...
There's something in Constantinople... something irresistible....
All right, go ahead, get her on the witness stand! What can she say?
She says she won't be intimidated by parasites. She called the Duchess a blood-sucking aristocrat and a blackmailer.
What did she say about me?
Well, it means another two weeks in Paris.
Oh, yes, but have you a safe here big enough to hold this?
He is a porter. He wants to carry them.
Allow me, Comrade.
We did our best, Comrade.
Give me another double brandy.
That kind of propaganda is bad anywhere, but inciting the attendants of a powder room to go on strike.... Well, if she succeeds the consequences will be disastrous.
Not always... look at me... I've been back twice. 
Here's my passport.... Please give me a visa. I have to leave for Russia immediately.
I think so too.
Me?
How long do we have to wait here?
Have I? Do you know when I come to think about it it's staggering. If I add it all up I must have spent years waiting for signals. Imagine! An important part of my life wasted between whistles.
Here... here we are... here you are and here I am... feel it?
I don't have to but I find it natural.
Suppress it.
That's a strange angle.
What a city! There are the Grands Boulevards... blasted out of the heart of the old streets. The Arc de Triomphe... made to greet Napoleon's army. The Opera! And Montmartre... Montparnasse... La Bohème... and now I'll show you the greatest attraction!  It will cost me a franc but it is worth it.  The most wonderful spot in all Paris -- unique! Here, look....  What do you see?
Is this what you call the "butler"?
No, though the mere thought makes my mouth water.
We take off our hat and coat.  We sit down -- we make ourselves comfortable. We adjust ourselves to the prospect of a most enjoyable evening. We look at each other. We smile.  Well... we don't smile. How about some music?
You don't have to do a thing. Chemically we are already quite sympathetic.
I was a sergeant in the Third Cavalry Brigade. Would you like to see my wound?
Poor Ninotchka. Poor, poor Ninotchka.
That's the way a clock works. There's nothing wonderful about it. You merely feel you must put yourself in a romantic mood to add to your exhilaration.
Ninotchka, or shall I say Special Envoy Yakushova...
All right, fight me, fight me as much as you want, but fight me tomorrow morning! There's nothing sweeter than sharing a secret with a bitter enemy.
Pardon me for addressing you but you insulted him, you know that. You hurt his feelings. It was just like telling a musician you don't like music. That good old man believes in food as you believe in Karl Marx. You can't go around hurting people, Comrade Yakushova, but maybe you can make it up to him. Do you know how?  By eating everything with relish, by drinking everything with gusto, by having a good time for the first time in your natural life!
This is a place for workmen.
What are you after?
Your tactics are useless. My name is neither Buljanoff, Iranoff, nor Kopalski.
But you have now, and I know now that you are a man who employs business methods which in Russia would be punished by death.
Death! Death! Always so glum! What about life, Ninotchka! Do Russians never think of life? Of the moment in which we are living? The only moment we really have? Don't take it all so seriously, Ninotchka. Nothing is worth it. Please... relax... I beg you, Sergeant... smile!
Well, er... let's drop it. I don't think you would care for that one.
I suppose you don't think that's funny?
Yes.
Did you make any change in this room?
She is very attractive. She has great elegance.  She's what you call a woman of the world, isn't she?
I suppose she is very entertaining... It must be lots of fun to be with her, so witty, so glamorous...
A funny story?
You never finished the one about the two Scotchmen with the names.
Oo! Darling! Something is the matter.
Oh, everything is so wonderful! It's getting farther and farther away!
No speech?
No speech.
Right: Lovers of the world unite!
Our salute will be a kiss.
Would that make you any happier?
Let's turn on the radio.
No music.
But I can throw it out of the window.
Thank you, Leon... thank you, masses.  Can I make a speech now?
Trying to keep me away from you! It couldn't be done. Naturally I couldn't go on forever punching passport officials in the nose -- but I found a way, didn't I? Darling, I had to see you. I wrote and wrote but all my letters came back.
If you don't stay with me, I'll have to continue my fight. I'll travel wherever Russian commissions are. I'll turn them all into Buljanoffs, Iranoffs, and Kopalskis. The world will be crowded with Russian restaurants. I'll depopulate Russia. Once you saved your country by going back. This time you can save it by staying here.
Hello, Leon!
It's really a wretched morning... wretched. I can't get myself right. I wanted to look mellow and I look brittle. My face doesn't compose well... all highlights... how can I dim myself down, Leon? Suggest something. I am so bored with this face. I wish I had someone else's face. Whose face would you have if you had your choice? Oh, well, I guess one gets the face one deserves.
This is the Duchess Swana... I want to speak to Monsieur Cornillon... it's very important... please get him right away... Hello, Monsieur Cornillon? The most incredible thing has happened! My jewels are here in Paris! Three Bolshevik swine are trying to sell them! Yes... yes... we must act immediately!... Call the police... Have them arrested!... Well, then, get an injunction!... But do something, Monsieur Cornillon!  ...But they are my jewels! There must be some way of getting them back!
Leon! What in heaven's name...!
Is anything wrong? Are you ill?
Make it ice cold.
That wouldn't have done any good. Not with her.  She's the most incredible creature I've ever seen.
Timeless. When she comes into a room you'd think that the Bolsheviks had taken over Paris. She wears her cheap miserable blouse as though it were the latest model by Schiaparelli. What a woman! What a woman! There is a Russian snowstorm in each of her eyes.
You saw all that in one glimpse?
Darling, if we're going to get anywhere someone has to keep his eyes open! 
Is this your new dress suit?
It's a dream of beauty. He never takes my word for anything, but I was right, wasn't I?
Is this, by any chance, going to be a confession?
Has done what?
It is not enough to be witty, madame. People grow tired of being entertained. You made that mistake before. Problems were never solved by bowing from a balcony.
Not before you agree to use those reservations to Moscow.
You were very careless with our precious jewels, my dear. They're too expensive a toy for two children to play with.
In other words moral ideas have no weight with you... all right, then let's deal with legal facts. You know that France has recognized the Soviet.
I see. You have calculated in terms of hunger.
Good morning, Comrade.
Does this include the products of the Far Eastern provinces?
I need very little sleep. We must be extremely careful what goods we take in exchange. I have already started a survey of our most urgent needs.
I think this is the first time you have been to my little place. Your face is new to me. Now, what shall it be?
Raw carrots and beets.
The future of the common people.
Why do you bring this up after so many years?
He says if he doesn't get it right away, he's going to blow us out of the water.  And he means it.  Ever since his wife died in the plane crash, he's been over the edge.
I was sorry to hear about your wife.
How the hell do you have the temerity to blackmail the President of the United States?
I'm one of his people.  The Cubans are his people.  And we're going to jail for him.
Howard, you'll serve no more than two years, then he'll pardon you.
Yeah?
I don't have time for all this shit!  Just handle it, Bob!  Keep it out of the White House.  What else? Kissinger's waiting -- he's gonna throw a tantrum again if I don't see him, threatening to quit ... again. 
In hiding.  He sent Liddy to talk to me.
The country's loving it.
... Y'know Al, if Hoover was alive none of this would've happened.  He would've protected the President.
You know, Al, men in your profession ... you give 'em a pistol and you leave the room.
I don't have a pistol.
It's totally out of context.  I was protecting the national security.  I never intended --
That's right ...
It's possible they were looking for evidence of an illegal Howard Hughes donation to the Democrats, so the Democrats couldn't make an issue of your Hughes money.
Silence!
"Security" is not strong enough.
The only problem with that, sir -- it gets us into obstruction of justice.
What?  That he knew Johnny Roselli? Hoover knew a lot of gangsters.
No ... a little deficit won't hurt. Jesus, they're serious.  Why're we stopping?
Don't forget the South, sir, the West. Filled with the good football colleges, straight kids.  There's more of 'em with you than against you.  Not like these mudmutts.
The Jews aren't the middle, Henry. They're the far left.
Congratulations, boss.  A great victory!  The madman theory wasn't so crazy after all.
You played it perfectly, sir -- cocksucker!  He's going to think twice before he leaks again.
Do not tell a lie, Richard ... The cornsilk cigarette Harold gave thee behind the store this morning.
Please, Mother, it ... it was just one time, Mother, I'm ... I'm sorry.
What do you think?  He said in life there's no free ride.
My friends call me "Mister President."
Of course we've tried, but so far we've come up with nothing that ...
And me? ...
And of course I accept.  I'm flattered.  And I want you to know, I work for only one president at a time.
But ... if we were able to separate China from Russia once and for all, we can -- we could create a balance of power that would secure the peace into the next century.
I never thought Jack was ready for the presidency.  But I would never, never consider ...  His death was awful, an awful thing for this country.  Do you ever think of death, Mr. Helms?
Flowers are continual reminders of our mortality.  Do you appreciate flowers?
Winning?
I never met the man.
You'll win the nomination.
You asked if you could count on my support ... As long as I can count on yours.
Yeah, you do.  I'd be bugging myself, Edgar ... Who'd get the tapes?
Injections.  Even this noble sport's been fixed.  Seen the guys?
Where'd you find him?
"A warrior with nerves of steel is yet broken by a thread of silk." Nietzsche.
Personally I'd prefer a greyhound with a shot of speed.
Party ain't started yet, Dick.  Got these gals coming over to the ranch later for a little private "thing," y'know ... There's some fellows I want you to meet.
There's no other choice.
... as the old alliances crumble.
Mr. President, this cannot be breathed!  Especially to our secretary of state -- that cretin Rogers ... The Chinese would never trust us again. The only way, I emphasize only way, to pull this off is in secret.
... because people have got to know whether or not their President is a crook.  Well, I am not a crook.  I have never made a dime from public service ...
Don't be stupid.  The world needs you, Henry; you always saw the big picture. You were my equal in many ways.  You're the only friend I've got, Henry.
Secret, Mr. Chairman?
Yes.
I must say you look very good, Mr. Chairman.
You're too modest, Nixon.  You're as evil as I am.  We're both from poor families.  But others pay to feed the hunger in us.  In my case, millions of reactionaries.  In your case, millions of Vietnamese.
We can prosecute the New York Times, go for an injunction ...
It was illegal, what he did.
The lie?
Goes to show you all the moolah in the world can't buy you a brain.
You're the one who should be in politics, John.  You're tougher than I am.  You never crack.
It broke my heart when Harold died.
... Use his women.
Hi.
We got the press this time!
Proud?
Sir?
There's more ... there's more than just me.  You can't break, my boy, even when there's nothing left.  You can't admit, even to yourself, that it's gone, Al.  Do you think those POWs in there did?
It's not fair, Buddy.  I can take the insults; I can take the name-calling. But I can't take the losing.  I hate it.
We don't have to put ourselves through this again, Dick.
Maybe I should get out of the game. What do you think, Buddy?  Go back to being a lawyer and end up with something solid, some money at the end of the line ... You know, I keep thinking of my old man tonight.  He was a failure, too.
Thank you, Fidel Castro.
I want a divorce.
Everything's political, for Christ's sake!  I'm political.  And you're political, too!
Why don't we go down to Key Biscayne together?  Just the two of us.
When?
Why didn't you?
You can't expect me to explain that to you.
And what would I find out that I haven't known for years.  What makes it so damn sad is that you couldn't confide in any of us. You had to make a record ... for the whole world.
Howya doin'!  New York treating you okay?  I'm sorry I haven't been able to see you at all--
Won or lost?
What?
Who else'd be in your truck.
What give you that idea. I seen one of the cats heard it.
What would you a done if he'd been released?
It's all the goddamned money, Ed Tom. The money and the drugs.  It's just goddamned beyond everything. What is it mean? What is it leading to?
Nothin'?
Not word one.
Would you tell me if you had?
Llewelyn can take care of hisself.
He won't neither. He never has.
I wish I could say that was in his favor. But I have to say I don't think it is.
It could be.
What was the bullet?
Sir, I don't want to picture that.
Yessir. It was punched out.
...This month's checks.
It is a car afire. But Wendell said there was something back country too.
When is the county gonna start payin' a rental on my horse.
...I love you more'n more, ever day.
...Be careful.
What do you think.
I don't know. Had dreams.
No.
You gave your word?
Llewelyn!
Goin' out.
Try standin' in the door and hollerin: Mama I'm home.
Llewelyn?
Hey.
Huh? What is...
...Where's the transponder?
I don't need to talk to you.
Is somethin' wrong?
See about closing.
Well... I need to close now --
Call it.
I didn't put nothin' up.
Look... I got to know what I stand to win.
Well you give me the model number of the tent I can order you the poles.
Why don't I set you down here and we won't argue about it.
I'm sorry.
Yeah but no one ever sees that. I like a man that'll tell you he's married.
What is he supposed to be, the ultimate bad-ass?
Chigurh. Anton Chigurh. You know how he found you?
I know how he found me.
Took me about three hours.
What product.
The heroin. You don't have it.
Yes sir. Two tours.
It's a type of altered state... it allows a traumatized person to continue functioning.
I can't... they prefer a more formal presentation. I don't usually go so close to the surface, but I was...
She knows who killed Del. Elden, she said it was a woman.
It wasn't a woman.
Yeah?
You said a woman couldn't have done it.
So you're saying Betty Sizemore -- our Betty Sizemore -- who you were in swing choir with -- has now hired somebody to scalp her husband in her own kitchen while she watched? You're amazing.
You're lying!
Just shut up a second and listen... That, uh... that bar in Arizona? Where you said Betty was?
What about it?
We need ammo... Go check his jacket, I'll cover you.
Oh. How come?
Who are these idiots?
You really... didn't have anything to do with what Del was doing, did you?
I am?
Did... did you really come here because you love this guy?
Of course, I don't know every doctor who works here...
It's all right.
Let me know if you need anything, okay?
Are you and Larry happy?
Then you should treasure that... you gotta hold on to whatever you got that's any good, even if it's only a little bit.
Halfway where? You've gotta come home. We've been worried sick about you. Are you alright?
Sue Ann, I thought you of all people would back me up on this, you know what Del's like. How did he take my note?
No, Del.
Honey, I didn't want to tell you at the time, but Del and I go way back. We went to school together. In fact, he saved my life. Two more minutes in that icy water and I would have drowned. But Del jumped in and grabbed me. We fell out of touch eventually, but I still owe him one.
I just want everything to be perfect between us.
At last! I know how much you want this. You're gifted and extremely determined, but... it's not up to me.
Thanks. But I'd like to hear what you're feeling...
What do you mean? What did I do to you...
You're doing this now? After all the... are you sick? Are you going to kill me now?
Mmm-hmm. Listen, I forgive you, Mr. McCord...
Thanks...
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hang on a second there, baby. Why do you need one of the new Buicks?
I don't need one, but it's kind of a special night, and --
No, I do not want any goddamn... what was all that shit on the phone about the new Buicks?
She's not comfortable in a Corsica? 'S got air and leather...
And I don't need Sue Ann's fat ass around to fuck it up...
It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
I came for love...
If that little weasel ever walked in here I wouldn't serve him.
And you called your friend, and she's telling you not to go?  When I went to Europe my friends told me I was crazy.
Ellen, this is the biggest thing I've ever done, but I've gotta do it.
You don't sound like you're from here.
It's something I had to do. For David.
I got this apartment with a guy.
The Five?
David isn't hiding from me, I left him standing at the altar six years ago and now I'm...
Doctor David Ravell.
Oh, it's a charity dinner. The money goes to a good cause, but I don't have anybody to go with...
No, almost never.
Rosa...
Your husband?!
Here's Ghengis Kunt and The Demilitarized Zone. Get it?  They're Korean, so they're pretty hot.
The fuck you talking about?
All right gentlemen, let's get down to it. I need to know if you're for real.
Driving their cars into trees... puking on the sidewalk... stupid shit!
That is so right.
You told me how to do it!
Well, why'd you shoot him?
I didn't. You gave me a look!
What 'look'?
You just gonna leave these cars sitting here like this?
Maybe you don't appreciate the gravity of this situation. It's bad enough that we don't have what we came here for. It's worse that we don't know where it is. And now this.  This was supposed to be my last job. I already put the deposit down on my boat.  How can you eat at a time like this? I get nauseous just watching you...
That was a really shitty thing to do.
You know, blonde, thin, whatever...
No... be dark before we get there. You wanna see the Grand Canyon at night?
This doesn't look like the kind of place Betty would go to.
No, you believed her, we drove all the way to L.A. so that means you trusted her that much... so why's the rest of her story suddenly so kooky? Huh?
Don't  Don't you talk about Betty like that. I don't care who she ends up being, you never use that word again. Got it?
...yeah, I got it.  Come on, you're stretching out my vest...
Hmm... you two in high school together?
I don't think she can do it. You saw what happened.
...what kinda car's Jasmine drive?
...why do you think you have to be missing a piece of your soul to kill somebody?
I don't know what you think you'll find, anyway.
The driver was killed. I think there's a connection --
No, about... Are you talking about Duane Cooley?
Probably the same thing my mom would do if I got engaged... have a heart attack.
Betty. It's O.K. except I'm worn out. We spent all weekend looking for her doctor-boy. How can a big time heart guy leave no trace of himself?
I see. And are you in touch with Mrs. Sizemore?
No. But I'm taping her show every day so she can watch it when she comes back.
Our pleasure, Big Dan.
You got light fingers, Everett. Gopher?
That's right!
That's right! We ain't really Negroes!
Delmar what the hell are you talking about? - We got bigger fish to fry-
What on earth is goin' on here! What's got into you, Delmar!
Pete have a brother?
It's Tommy! They got Tommy!
Gonna pluck us off the tit.
Suckin' away.
Reason why he's pullin' ah pants down.
No, I believe he's a-gonna paddle it.
Well, that's how I characterize it.
Pullin' ah pants down...
Enticements a power, wealth, settera.
Vernon Waldrip.
I ain't worn it since our divorce came through. It must still be in the rolltop in the old cabin. Never thought I'd need it; Vernon bought one encrusted with jewels.
That's one of Aunt Hurlene's.
That don't make no sense!
Itta Bena, now, uh, that would be...
They lured me out for a bathe, then they dunked me'n trussed me up like a hog and turned me in for the bounty.
Who's the honcho around here?
Well sir, my name is Jordan Rivers and these here are the Soggy Bottom Boys outta Cottonelia Mississippi- Songs of Salvation to Salve the Soul. We hear you pay good money to sing into a can.
Listen, kid, I was sorry to hear about your mom. That's pretty rough. I would've returned your call a lot sooner but I was out at sea...
I thought you quit school. Last I heard you were on your way to a construction job or something down in Brazil.
Yeah, I know.
Hey, did you hear? Sands and Kantrowitz DORed last night.  Survival of the fittest.
The whole world's a jungle, huh, Mayo? Dog eat dog down to the last one, right?
Mayo, Zack Mayo, sir!
Where'd you get this, Mayo? This is really wonder work.
It's important, sir!
You said, 'How're you?' I am not a 'ewe,' boy! A ewe is a female sheep, boy! Is that what you think I am, boy?
Yes, sir!!
Vietnam?
You're sure it's okay?
Ashamed? No -- I love you, Lynette. I mean that. After I leave them, I'll meet you at the motel, okay?
I had to, baby... I'm no aviator. I was faking it, like I was with everything else in my life... up 'til right now.
Come on, guys. It's five o'clock.
See you in a month when you get liberty!
No, but I told him I'd be at the Town Tavern next Saturday night, and he sounded like he might come.
You hope.
Paula, how far would you go to catch Zack?
No way... Would you?
That don't justify trying to trap a boy by getting pregnant, Lynette! Nothing justifies that. I can't believe you're even thinking like that. I mean, that's really backward.
God! I've never seen anything like that in my whole life! Did you see that guy's nose?
Lynette, just keep your mouth shut until we get to the motel. Will you do that for me, please.
Really?
That was great.
I don't want to move. But somebody has to move sometime. Eventually.
I'm sorry. I can't sit with you.
Nothing. Go back to the show, Paula.
No. Is that what you want?
So?
Yeah. You got the whole story just right.
Beware of the Puget Debs -- and we all laughed, especially him.
I bet you do!
No problem, but who's Susan?
Talk to me in the morning. I feel like shit.
I don't get it! He's the best candidate in our class! Ask anyone! The best student! The best leader! The best friend to everybody! Couldn't you bend your goddamn standards just a little?
No problem.
You're welcome.
God.
What?  What do you want me to do?
That's your problem.
Asshole.
Hey man, after all we went through I am not walking out when we're this close.
We're not leaving.  I'm getting in that room, and I'm opening that safe.
What do you want?
Your husband says you said "There are three..." right before you got cut off.
Master bath.
That door is a safely hazard.
"Half?"  What did you, take a nap in math class?  Three people, three shares, one third.  Four point six six six repeating.
That's right, Raoul, it wasn't your idea, none of this was your idea, it was mine, it's my family we're ripping off, it's my prick grandfather who built that fucking room, it was my idea to get the plans, I found the floor safe, and it was my idea to ask a guy who builds these rooms to help break into one!  Me, me, me, I, I, I, at no point did I say "you" or Raoul," got it?
No cars.  Feet are faster.
Too many stairs.
The crowd goes wild.
He's going down.
"What we want is in that room."
Are you freaking out?
If it looks like I can't get back, just close the door.
Tyrone...
Well... is it loaded?
Free? We're back where we started. Shit we still don't have a stop light.
Like?
So... we understand each other Judge?
What's with you?
Inspector Brimmer
Judge, hold on, is your phone safe?
I ain't gonna shoot you Judge. Look... it's over. Just run away. Get out. Stay away from Oakland. Cause it's gone... it's gone.
You know it. Stay Black...
Sabu... High white dude's the only thing you could hustle.
Motherfucker... you stay away...
PE? What? You guys doing gym class?
Hey, it's the invisible man. Brother where you been?
C'mon we'll walk and talk...
Don't I know it. Come on in Agent Rodgers. Sit down. Always a... pleasure to see you. How can I be of help?
Are you finished?
The time, my friend, is what Sartre called, "the moment the match is being put to the fuse." Question is, is the hand holding that match gonna be black or white.
Huh, well then...  did someone else start shooting?
...at least that takes Bobby Seale off the street...
Well, then we're going to take that power away from those bastards.
Shit, nothing but Paper Panthers.
We'll get them. Right now we got to worry about being armed and ready to protect Betty Shabazz. Those phonies sure as hell can't. We need guns.
This here's a "Panther Patrol." We see a brother getting busted. We check it out, make sure the pig don't go beating on the man. Brother gets taken downtown, we post bail, hook 'em up with a lawyer.
Alright, I'll stay. Judge, I want to...
You are down for protecting Malcolm's widow aren't you?
I do. You think you're smart enough to keep playing the game?
Me? You've got a whole lot of other folks signing up. Why me?
Huey, man who's gonna straighten out the brothers if they get on my ass?
I saw... but...
Chickenshits? What you bring your buddies with you?
Motherfuckers...
Where is he?.
Motherfuck... well then I got something to do.
If I'd known you were going to look like this, I never would have put ink in your tea.
I say we drink the wine, shoot the dogs, and use the papers for musket wadding.
You got salt last week.
Oh, right.  Baking powder, we need baking powder.
Yes, sir.
Colonel will do.
Thank you.
Certainly you must know that in civilized warfare, officers in the field must not be accorded inappropriate levels of hostile attention.
Very well, let us move on to...
Prisoner exchange.
You have eighteen of my men.  I want them back.
Perhaps.
The New York and Rhode Island assemblies have been dissolved...
Anything about the convention in Philadelphia?
The British army is barricaded in Boston.  Harry Lee, is here from Virginia, recruiting for a Continental Army.
Do you intend to enlist without my permission?
I have to get these dispatches to Hillsboro.
You're in no condition to ride.
Less than a mile.  Forty-one wagons, a company of Redcoat infantry, horses at the rear.
Gabriel?  Are you asleep?
I should have killed him when I had the chance?
Father, tell me what happened at Fort Wilderness?
And what do they know?
That's not enough.  Tell me.
It was a different time, son.  And you're a better man than that.
There are some letters here from him.  Some are just to you.
An American nation.  Colonel Lee, with your permission?
That's what I'm doing.  I will not fight and because I won't, I will not cast a vote that will send others to fight in my stead.
Green Dragoons came to my home, killed my son, Thomas.  It was Tarleton himself.
We're a breath away from losing this war.  In the North, Washington is reeling from Valley Forge, running and hiding from Clinton and twelve thousand Redcoats.  Here in the South, Cornwallis has broken our back.  He captured over five thousand of our troops when he took Charleston and today he destroyed the only army that stood between him and New York.
Not held, just slowed down.
It is ended.
Goodbye, Francis.
I'm familiar with appropriate behavior at a military parley.
Thank you.
For what?
For trying to impose some decency on that sort.
How many came back?
Colonel, let us help his soul find it's place with the Almighty and...
Remember Braddock?
No, he won't.  There are two things you need to know about Cornwallis. First, he is a very proud man, He would rather risk defeat than share a victory.  If you give him what he thinks is an out, he'll take it.
Seventeen.
Father... I killed those men...
Bite?
Ellie...God doesn't do things like that. I know you loved y'brother, but--
Yes, but the rope might be--
Lovey...Church might be still alive when you're in a high school...and that's a very long time.
Yeah, I know...how are things out there in Chicagoland?
Is he really all right?
Because you promised.
I've noticed it, too. I'll cough up the money, Ellen.
What's up, sugar?
But don't you dare say that.
I won't...is Missy in heaven, do you think?
Sure, carnation. Like in that movie you rented, Audrey Rose.
Then why do I have to go to bed?
Excuse me, Mr. Crandall--I've got to change this kid. It's nice to meet you.
You folks ready to go on?
Who owns the woods up ahead? Paper companies?
No--not right out loud. Their stones speak...or their markers. Even if the marker ain't nothing but a tin can someone wrote on with a Magic Marker, it speaks. Ain't that so, Louis?
My wife is not crazy about cemeteries of any kind. As you may have noticed.
Bagged cat. What a mess.
But--
What say, Louis?
What do you mean?
Yes.  Where are we going, Jud?
You want to rest a bit before you start?
What are those for?
What did we do, Jud?
I know the Micmacs thought it was a holy place...and then they thought it was a cursed place. That's why they moved on.
And Buckaroo Banzai.
Well, I've got a million questions about the area, and---
---and you'll end up doing a free consultation on his arthritis or urinary problems and---
Louis, are you sure?
Safe!  At Port Royal.  With the Royal Navy.
We got that part.  Anything else?
No!  You gave your word!
Hah.  Ten years you carried that pistol, and you end up wasting your shot.
Wait as long as you like.
That fool woman took it.  You be careful around her, Jack -- she's pretty enough, she'll steal your heart -- but pure evil inside.
That's proper, sir, according to the code.
Of course.  I didn't steal it, if that's what you mean.
No, no, nothing like that.  Very well.  You hand that over, we'll put your town to our rudder and ne'er return.
On his heels!  Gillette, bring a squad down from the fort!  Elizabeth, are you --
Commodore, you can't do that!
You may seclude yourself in my cabin.  I'm afraid we do not have any ladies' clothing aboard.
I knew it.
I can't believe he would make such a sacrifice for us.
You are despicable.
Me!
You're in league with Barbossa!
But ... you did it before!  Last time --
Why?
You -- you burned up the island, for a one-time chance at being spotted?
He might delay the rescue ... and that would be too late.
Kid's a bit of a stick, isn't he?
I'll tell lee.  Now, Jack Sparrow has an honest streak in him, and that's where the whole problem starts.  This was when he was Captain of the Black Pearl --
What's your name?
You would do that?
That chart I drew up'll get you past the reefs.  If you're steersman's good enough, that is.
I'll be at the wheel myself.
I do.  And I practice with them. At least three hours a day.
Somewhat.
Well, you're the worst pirate I've ever heard of.  You're a man who can be trusted, who can be counted on, and who can't betray his friends.  What kind of pirate is that?
Yes it is.  I've seen it.
You've seen it?
Yes.
Yes, I have.
You've seen a ship with black sails that's crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out?
I think he's telling the truth.
But --
Please.
Speak.
You can't mean that.
We will always love most that which we create.  Don't you agree, Susan?
I swear to you, Argon, if you don't stop the meltdown that nanobot will be the last one I ever build.
What did you use?
I should kill you right now for what you did to me!
You can't do this!  You owe me, O'Brien.  I made you plastic!  I made you!
She's working as fast as she can, Icarus.  It will be ready soon.
Oh no.  No.  We'll get her assistant.  What's-his-name? Nebbishman?
Based on what we know of him, that would seem inevitable.
Yes.  Yes, of course it is.
Consideration?
Did I?  I've been waiting for that for years.
Facts, Dr. Nebbleman.  Facts. You've been using cryogenics to control the waste from the mouse experiment, haven't you?
That might work.
Hey!
Why don't you just put this in your pocket so when you see a garbage can you can put it where it belongs.
What is it with you litterbugs?  Is it a territorial thing, marking your turf with your garbage?
Oh yeah.  They were working on molecular assemblers, too, weren't they?
What are you going to do?
Dr. Argon would say we are all prisoners.
You mean the designs for the nanobot?  You think after this I'm going to give them to him?
Sir, please try to hold still.
Is that so?
The big house?
Well, it was good to see you, Daniel, but I have to be going.
We don't have time for hysterics.
Got it.
I'm sorry, Daniel, but you have to admit it's pretty ironic that you of all people would be the first man ever polymerized.  It's got to mean something.
What's that?
Did you go?
Oh no.  They're trying to blame you for the accident.  That means they must not have been able to control the replicators.
Run, Daniel!  Get out of here!
You saved my life.
That's impossible.
Don't mind Mother.
I suppose you're going to print them?
Will - uh - five thousand be enough?
Me? No - most ordinary guy in the world, me. Only one thing wrong with me—
I'm just beginning to believe that something could be done with you.
Say, you could do anything with me you wanted to. Putty - just putty, that's me.  Now getting back to those eyes of yours - would you mind if I kind of got closer so I could see them?
Hello, Natalie. Mr. Stewart Smith . . . Miss Montgomery, Mrs. Eames, Mrs. Radcliff, Mr. Radcliff—
Throw me out - because I'm beginning to get goofy ideas, and they concern you, Anne.
Of course I am Stewart.
Got my initials on them too. They're cute. They're nice little things - what do you do with them?
Oh, yes you will my dear - oh, yes you will my dear - you'll wear garters and you'll like it too!
Oh, you can't carry a tune - you can't carry a tune - all you are good for is to sit and spoon, spoon. Oh no, I won't wear garters—
You know, Stewart, you failed to mention that Miss Gallagher was a very beautiful young girl.
Is this true, Stewart? Did you really say it?
I'm not going!
I'm talking about - I'm not going out.
Oh, they're all right, Anne. But I—
Your house?
You've done nothing but watch me - watch me! - ever since I've been here. Treated me like a thug, watched me like a hawk, mistrusted me. Every time I leave the house, that Jane—  —goes out and counts the silverware.
You're acting like a child.
I should say you had. At the rate you two are going, we'll have to leave the country to save our faces.
Good morning, Mother. Didn't I tell you that he'd be marvelous. Everybody thought he was so charming last night.
I was so worried for fear he'd knock over a vase or something. I must have acted like an idiot.  What does it say about the reception last night?
This way.
I knew your managing editor very well.
Is that so?
Is that so?
Couldn't make the last edition. It'd take me four hours to translate your story into English.
Big Chief Bingy come to white man's tepee to make friends. Big Chief very sorry. To show how sorry - will bend over and let white man kick Big Chief where sun never shines.
Yeah?
Aagh! No wonder you're batty. Would it be imposing too much upon you if I asked you to do a little work today? Just to sort of break the monotony?
Come on, get going, get going!
No, no - it's true, all right, only we didn't want to get it in print yet, that's all.
Yeah, live on my salary - that is, until I finish writing my play.
Araby?
I'm not quitting!
No!
How do you like your bath, sir?
Say, you are nice. You're all right. You'd make a good wife.
Yes.
Mr. Smith? Oh, you mean Ann Schuyler's husband?
He's probably very tired. You see, he's had to meet all these people personally tonight.
I bet.
You're sure going to be poison to that Junior Leaguer[4] from now on!
And the rest of us are truck horses?
Oh no, you won't, Mr. Smith. You're a married man now. Mother always warned me never to run around with married men.
Sure - I think so, Stew.
What did you do to that hair? And where did you get that dress?
They all consider me just as one of the boys.
No, no. Strange, I've never seen Anne act that way before.  It's funny I never thought to tell her you were a girl, isn't it?
How about my breakfast? How do you expect me to ring a curtain down on an empty stomach?
Just a habit. Mr. Schuyler is a bit put out by all the rumors going around.
I've tried to stop the evening papers, but it's useless.
Why deny it? The more you deny, the more they print. Let them alone! The thing to do is to sit still and keep our traps shut.
I suppose you know why I came—?
Now don't be absurd, Smith—  May I come in?
Yes.
The rest of the gang had to get out the morning edition - but they'll be down later.
Pardon me, madam. They phoned through from the Mayor's committee to remind you it's past the hour for the reception.
Yes - the worm!
And you struck him right here in our house—?
That's the fourteenth crack you've made to me. I'm keeping count. When you get to twenty, I'm gonna sock you right on the nose. As a matter of fact, I ought to sock you right now.
What's going on here? Who is this woman?
There are no gentlemen on the Tribune.
But I—
No, sir!
Well, sir, I putter.
Well sir, to be a putterer, one's mind must be at ease. A person with a problem could never be a putterer. For instance, sir, a fish can putter in water but not on land because he'd be out of place. An eagle can putter around a rugged mountaintop but not in a cage, because he'd be restless and unhappy. Now sir, if you will pardon me, with all due respect, sir, as a Smythe to a Smith, you are an eagle in a cage.
Yes.
What goes on up at Lover's Lane?
What?
It doesn't matter.
Bu-ud ... Mary Sue ... Your breakfast is getting cold.
How 'bout some Marshmallow Rice Squares?
Wait.
Thanks. I thought you weren't gonna ...
And ... wear this on the trip in case it gets cold.
Having kind of a tough time.
Bud?
Sounds nice ... Once you get used to it.
Bud, your sister's a little older now and she's naturally going to start going out with boys.  ... In fact pretty soon--she's even going to get married and make someone a good little home-maker like your mother here.  That's IF she can learn to bake.
"Changes."
No. What?
I think I've got something to say.
Why am I out of order?
THIS BEHAVIOR WILL STOP AT ONCE.
Dan! Arrest them!
What do you mean!?
What?
"It was big 'n brown 'n kept goin' an' goin' as far you could see."
Hear your Dad got a new car.
Weil great. You can watch TV upstairs.
Noooooo!
What's going to happen?
It's in your closet.
They don't notice that kind of thing.
Me too. Sounds swell.
D.H. Lawrence. You ever heard of him?
Well ... I just ...  Can I ask you a question?
Yeah ...
No. She really liked you.
How come I'm still in black and white?
I told you. I'm like positive.
I baked you my oatmeal cookies.
Oh, no ... You baked those for Whitey.
Oh ... Hi.
Well it's louder ... And scarier I guess ... And ... and a lot more dangerous ...
What's that like?
Where are they?
Okay, whose window did Bud break when he was playing with his father's golf clubs?
You know, we didn't call any TV repair.
McGinty's.
No. McIntire's. Remember:  "For the very best in men's attire, Head right down to McIntire's."
Look--we appreciate it. We really do. We just--we want to go home now.
WAIT A MINUTE!!
I can't.
OKAY. NOW YOU'RE REALLY STARTING TO PISS ME OFF!
What's wrong?
Yeah.
It's okay. We'll get you a new one.
Gosh, I loved that show. Watched it for years.
Told you it was your lucky day. Bet you thought I was just a fan or something.
Dream come true, hunh?
Saw you at the mall yesterday.
No, no, no.
I'm looking at your advertisement for the airline promotion and giveaway?
What's the listing?
I'm just stopping by to say hello.
Hello.
So you're coming tonight, right?
Yes, indeed, yes I am.
Yeah but please don't do that: everyone would be looking at me.
It's a free country, we can look at you if we want to.
You just said very food.
You look nervous.
Seriously, though: We're going to eat, I said.
I'm not being scared, you're just going to rag me if I do this --
I'm not gonna rag you. Why would I do this just to rag you?
......she forgot her purse at my work and I wanted to get it back to her.
This is Georgia.
I'm just laying on my bed.
What do you mean it doesn't matter?
Really?
What do you mean, "really?" Yeah. Really. What about you?
I'm horny, Jack, what about you?
...yeah.....
I have my own business....I work. I work hard at doing my business.
Not very late.
Like seven-fifty. Seven hundred fifty?
Really? Please?
Yeah. It's so hard these days and I really need it.
I didn't lie.
Why did you tell me you did, then?
No I'm sorry, now I have to get off the phone....
I don't know.
Maybe I'll see you later, when I pick up my car?
Hi.
I'm going to go and eat tomorrow night do you want to go with me?
Yeah.
Did you really come to meet me on purpose or are you lying about that?
You see if you spent $3,000 dollars on pudding you could earn over one million frequent flyer miles.
I thought you said you bought all that pudding --
There's a better place for us to eat.
Did something happen; are you alright?
Your portable reed organ....the piano.
Are you learning how to play it?
I just wanted you to know, wherever you're going or whatever you're doing right now I want you to know that I wanted to kiss you just then.
It's Barry.
I'm calling you, I'm standing in my hotel room, I came because I have my business trip --
Where you married?
You got me out of my hotel room. You came and got me out of my room.
I just...your face is so adorable and your cheek and your skin, I wanna bite it....I wanna bite your cheek and chew on it....god damn cute....fuck....
For what?
Yeah.
It's ok to ask that.
It's a plastic, yeah.
If you wanted to call me back I could...
It's fine. I can just get you at your office.
Why? ...what?
I know.
Why?
I'm gonna call the police then, sir.
-- it's $2.99 per minute for the first half hour and $1.99 per minute after that.
Of course, it's just for us to verify your credit card information. It's completely confidential and it appears on your credit card billing statement as D&D Mattress Man.
No one will know your name.
Who is this?
How many sisters do you have?
How you doin' Barry?
You ok?
No thanks.
What's up?
This is a bunch of bullshit.
What are you doing?
I'm just talking on the phone to you and standing.
Seriously.
You can't be late though.
I know.
I know.
I'll see you there.
When can you leave?
What's the problem?
I'll go pay for my car.
You ready?
They need to see the new 484's to make sure it works with their OC....
It's remarkable, Doctor. The patients are so subdued; so docile.
My years tending the lepers at St. Emilion steeled me for life's grisliest offerings, Doctor.
"And so the Professor lifted Colombe's skirt high, above her waist. 'Let me be your Tutor,' said he, 'in the ways of love.' With that, he slid her pantalettes down, down, down over her knees, and there -- nestled between her legs -- as pink as a tulip, as slick as an eel --"
If you're going to slander him, then you don't deserve to hear his stories --
The Doctor's a respected man, a friend of the court --
I haven't been to see the Marquis for ages. And I won't -- ever again -- I swear it. I won't speak to him, I won't even utter his name --
We treat you well enough here, don't we Marquis? Your very own featherbed, in lieu of a straw mat. Your antique writing desk, all the way from LaCoste. Enough quills to feather an ostrich --
I'm not a beautiful young prospect, ripe for corruption.
It's not even a proper novel! It's nothing but an encyclopedia of perversions! Frankly, it even fails as an exercise in craft. The characters are wooden; the dialogue is inane. Not to mention the endless repetition of words like "nipple" and "pikestaff" --
I write of the great, eternal truths that bind together all mankind! The whole world over, we eat, we shit, we fuck, we kill and we die.
Put yourself in my place. I've your fellow patients to consider. If Charenton falls, they've no place to go. No manner in which to clothe or feed themselves --
His rug.
I DIDN'T CREATE THIS WORLD OF OURS! I ONLY RECORD IT!
What in God's name am I to do with you? The more I forbid, the more you're provoked!
What on earth would that require?
I saw the longing in your eye --
This may feel a tad awkward, my friend, but it needn't be. I've merely come to oversee your work here; understood?
His wife's influence.
Do you favor its publication?
I have.
I beg you, Doctor, don't make me say it.
My, my. You have exceeded my expectations.
But I am history.
Charenton? The administrator there is quite well-loved, is he not?
His wife was trying to escape; they caught her on the stair, and set upon her with bayonets.  "There but for the grace of God"... eh, Doctor?
Did I frighten you?
The climax comes at a higher cost; you must sit on my lap.
The story's thrilling conclusion comes at a premium.
I must say, in your novels you stoke the most unrealistic expectations.
It needn't be; not if you've another story.
-- whose cell lies next to the linen cabinet! There, armed with a quill of my own, I'll commit it to paper!
I am not a wealthy woman.
It's tainted money, Doctor.
Leave at once --
I'd prefer to have our brandy in the salon. There we can sit... side-by- side... before the fire.
Sure
You know this CITIZEN KANE picture? About Pops and everything?
Marion, everyone knows you're not like that--
Randolph!
And maybe we could get Mr. Warner and Mr. Goldwyn and Mr. Cohn and Mr. Selznick to play as well.
How bad is it?
How much?
How does one get 125 million dollars in debt?
This picture--
You don't have any money left, okay?! That's the truth. I don't wanna say it, nobody else will say it, but it's the truth. You spent it all. You can't buy the Tribune in Chicago -- you can't buy ^ g-g- goddamn thing. Now you better face up to it--
That's right. You've captured me exactly. Goodnight.
Tough shit. We need to t-t-talk about this--
I just want to understand--
Yes?
Sir?
Sir, I-
I want blood
"Well, if you got drunk to talk to me about Miss Alexander, don't bother. I'm not interested. I've set back the sacred cause of reform, is that it? All right, if that's the way they want it, the people have made their choice. It's obvious the people prefer Jim Gettys to me."
You're not going to get another chance, boy! Look right at the monster and you tell him--
We're using-
You're not doin' Hearst, are you?
Good God no! The character is a delicious amalgamation of various press barons--
That's right. A symphony of those: vaunted and valued tellers-of-truth. Those heroic minutemen standing sentry on our liberties--
You drink at 10 am, do you?
But you keep coming up with the same elitist crap - - HEART OF DARKNESS with a million dollar budget?! - - no one wants to see that.
So, we've got to come up with our movie. Our biography.
But with compassion and insight--
I don't wanna write about no spic.
Howard Hughes, he would just kill us. Hearst he would kill us and fuck everything we ever loved.
I expected more from you.
I remember a man who wrote I He was a brilliant writer who dazzled me time and time again with his wit and insight--
He'll destroy us.
This girl on a dock. White dress. Never said a word to her.
If he had known about KANE before you made it, you'd be dead already.
You wrote the damn thing, Mank Aren't you going to fight for it?!
Hell, I know how it ends.  Hey, Rosebud's the sled!
He truly doesn't care if he ever works again.
May I help you?
CITIZEN KANE
Jesus
Listen to me. The press ban is killing us and the distributors won't book it. And meantime I'm dealing with the stockholders in New York who are scared shitless -- and I'm this far from getting fired myself -- and you don't have a friend in the world but me right now. So you have got to trust that I'll do what I can to--
How dare you talk to me like that! Do you think I'm like all the rest of those pirates?! Like Mayer and Warner? Is that what you think--?!
You're not still mad at me, I hope
You know something, Orson, you haven't done anything but lie to me from the moment we met. But, ya know, I'd do it again in a second.
They wanna talk to you.
I don't run the joint. They just told me to bring you in.
Tommy, thanks for coming over.
Yeah, they're good. They're good, Tommy.
Here's your carrots. You're in such a hurry. You can't wait.
Where you going at this hour?
I ain't ever gonna fight Joe Louis, that's what's the matter.
And that hard-on, Salvy. Who's he think he is? I'm gonna let that fuckin' hard-on come up here and act like a big shot.
No, I'm not afraid. Why? You wanna meet her?
Cause I'll go right over there and bring her here.
You know, like bang her or anything?
Hey, watch your mouth. Don't talk like that. She's still my wife.
You won and was robbed! You didn't do nothin' wrong.
Say what you gotta say. Don't be a smart ass.
What do you mean?
When I'm away, did you ever notice anythin' funny with her? Tell me the truth.
I want you to keep an eye on her when I'm not here. Understand?
Screw you, Jack.
What? I just said hello. Since when I can't kiss my sister-in-law?
Well, you're not supposed to kiss your mother on the mouth.
When?
So, go ahead. Kill everybody. Kill Salvy, kill Vickie, kill Tommy Como, kill me while you're at it. What do I care? You're killing yourself the way you're eating, the way you worry about things you don't have to worry about.
Does that mean...
Don't fight anymore!  It's a free country, don't fight anymore!
He ain't hurting me, but I can't get him down.
I just wanted to say hello.
You don't talk very much.
Can you see it?
Jake...
Jake...
Who asked you?
What're you lookin' at? You lookin' at him?
What did I say?
You know what I'm talking about. Don't ever make me look bad on the night of my big fight.
I took the kids to my sister's.
You're the fuckin' animal! You ran around with every guy I knew while I was breakin' my ass for you.
You know, if there's one thing -- I just don't understand you, not one single little bit. You love me?
I dunno.
No. I won't talk to you where you can use your hands on me.
The kids are sleeping.
Don't make no difference no more.
He should.
Tomorrow, at the gym. Don't forget.
Joey, relax. You're taking this the wrong way. Why don't you sit down and have a drink?
Try to understand, Vickie. Jake's got a lotta aggravation. He's been a top contender too long.
This could go off in a month -- or an hour.
Of course, it's normal for a man to tie his trunk up with a heavy rope.
Mrs. -- Thorwald's -- clothes. -- Clean -- carefully packed -- not too stylish -- but presentable.
I'll admit it all has a mysterious sound -- but is could mean a number of different things. Murder is the least likely.
I'll bet it's been done.
Almost everything's been done -- under panic. But this is a thousand to one shot. That man's still sitting around his apartment; he isn't panicked.
By the way  what happened to your leg?
I think they missed their chance with her.
What time?
Feel a little foolish?
Well then do a good job of it! Get over there, and search Thorwald's apartment! It must be knee-deep in evidence.
Give him evidence.
A possibility.
I don't know what pet name Thorwald had for his wife. And that night he went out half a dozen times with the metal suitcase. He wasn't taking his possessions, because they're up in his apartment now!
Where'd they take Lisa?
Didn't I tell you! Didn't I tell you it was the next place to watch?
With that cast on -- you don't.
Who are you?
No.
Nonsense. A man is always ready for marriage -- with the right girl. And Lisa Fremont is the right girl for any man with half a brain, who can get one eye open.
She's only perfect.
I can just hear you now. "Get out of here you perfect, wonderful woman! You're too good for me!"
The insurance Company would be a lot happier if you slept in your bed, not the wheelchair.
It's hard to figure. He went out several time last night, in the rain carrying his sample case.
Now what could he sell at three in the morning?
His personal effects. He's probably running away -- the coward.
There's a dip at this end. And since when do flowers grow shorter in two weeks?
What?
Got a shovel?
Anything else bothering you?
We sell a dozen a day in this price range.
Something big going on somewhere?
It's cracked -- and you never use it. And it's too ornate. I'm sending up a plain, flat silver one -- with just your initials engraved.
Now that's no way to spend your hard- earned money!
What would you think of starting off with dinner at the "21"?
Tell me -- what was Slim Hayward wearing?
All right. That's your opinion. You're entitled to it, but --
Huh? Try and find a raincoat in Brazil. Even when it isn't raining  Lisa, on this job you carry one suitcase. Your home is the available transportation. You sleep rarely, bathe even less, and sometime the food you even look at when they were alive!
Not quite -- it seems.  Goodbye, Jeff.
Why would a man leave his apartment three times, on a rainy night, with a suitcase? And come back three times?
Not that salesman's wife. And why didn't he go to work today?
What do you think?
Do you think I consider this recreation?
I don't know what you consider it -- but if you don't stop it, I'm getting out of here.
Maybe she died.
There is -- I've seen things through that window! Bickering, family fights, mysterious trips at night, knives, saws, rope -- and since last evening, not a sight or sound of his wife! Now you tell me where she is and what she's doing!
No comment.
Thinking about Thorwald?
A woman has a favorite handbag -- it always hangs on her bedpost where she can get at it. Then she takes a trip and leaves it behind. Why?
Night. I'm going to stay with you.
You are. You have a talent for creating difficult situations.
I do?
Weird.  Why don't I slip into something comfortable?
Huh?
Well?
Chelsea 2-7099.  We scared him once. Maybe we can scare him again.  I'm using that word "we" a little too freely, I guess. I don't take any of the chances.
You satisfied or you want more?
Sure.  It's fine.
Smashed the front door.
Nothing, Crunch.  They picked him up like the rest of--
You can't protect me.
You mind if I try?  You have to slam the door in my face?  I try to get to him--what happens?  Don't I give you everything you want?  A bicycle--you get a bicycle. A car--
Yeah!
Yeah!  Shh!
What would you do, Dad?
The kind we've been talking about. Can you answer me now?
What can you do when you have to be a man?
Sure--there was a bad accident there.  They showed the pictures on T.V.
He depended on me.
I'm just explaining what you mean! You can't be an idealist all your life!  Nobody thanks you for sticking your neck out!
Are you going down there?
Is he there?
You know if the boy ever talked to a psychiatrist?
You remember me?
What?
He's a wheel.  So's she.  It's hard to make friends with them.
What's your name!
I got to go in.  You better get home too.  Hey--what?
If you want to come we could talk and then in the morning we could have breakfast like my dad used to--  Gee...if you could only have been my father...we could...
Everybody!  Crunch and Goon and everybody!  I think they're going to kill you.
Hey where'd you go?
Shut up.  Are you nuts?
I came here before.
We didn't run out.  We were coming right back.
I need it.
They like you.  Okay?
Do you enjoy doing this to me or what--
Well, it doesn't matter anyhow-- because we're moving.
Leave me alone.
A zoo.  He always wants to be my pal, you know?  But how can I give him anything when he's--I mean I love him and I don't want to hurt him--but I don't know what to do anymore except maybe die.
Any time--day or night.  You calmed down enough to go back now?
Where what was.
Where's Dawson High School?
It doesn't matter to them.
You were looking for me, weren't you?
No--I was just--maybe--
Why don't we just rent it for the season?
I don't know.
Is this what it's like to love somebody?
I never felt so clean before.
It is for me too.
Maybe next summer he's going to take me hunting with him--and fishing.  I want him to teach me how and I bet he won't get mad if I goof.  His name's Jim.  It's really James but he likes Jim more.  People he really likes--he lets call him "Jamie."
Don't give it a thought.  Only three million dollars a month!
Your mother will be down in a few minutes, Judy--
We used to sing it in school.  Don't look at me with such horror. They had schools in those days.
Nothing, only it'd be nice to spend an evening together for a change.
With us old creeps?  Come on, we have to eat.
He wants... your "sister"...
One more day, baby. One more day to Christmas.
I've been doing good, though.
He's shown us the setup, he's drawn us the map, he's helped us do the plan. He wants a gun, give him a gun. Take the bullets out, whatever, but give him the gun. The more manpower we've got in there, the better. He won't try and make his move till the money's in hand.
You can't find... what?
Thought you wrote you had a mustache.
All the guys I've ever been with... they never want to know me. Who I am on the inside. They just want to qet inside. When they do, they think that means they know who I am. That I trust them. That they know me. That there's nothing left to learn.  A guy like you, Nick -- six months before you can even touch my face. I figure a guy in that kind of bind, he's gonna hafta work to get to know me some other way.
Beauty and fragrances.
We could live it up and --
I won't let 'em, Nick. They won't hurt you anymore.
What the fuck is going on.
Nick, no --
You sold him out.
They changed the layout -- whadda they call you? Mr. Monster? They remodeled the place. When I worked there -- listen to me -- guy that managed the joint, guy who ran it--
No!
Well, shit, Judas, you shoulda at least gotten that --
Nick! He wants to know how to rob it, and he'll leave you alone! That's all he wants!  I hate him, Nick... you know how...
He working for them on this one?
And I'm his ticket.  What's the last place they took down?
What?
Nick...
We'll get there, baby... we'll get there...
He wants to see your map.
What?
You said it a million times!
I was in the joint with him! I knew about him and her, okay!? I took his place!
But you were saying you were...
Wish I had a brother like you.
You do.
Do I get a country-western name?
Ten dollars? What do I do with ten dollars?
I want a map of that security level. Every room, every guard, every thing.
That part, Nick... was planned out the day I read your letters.
What. We all gonna dress up like cowboys?
Can't be attracting attention, right?
Who's robbin' who here, Gabriel...
Mister. I'm begging, 'kay? I'm begging. This is not some card club, 'kay? This is the Tomahawk. We're an international gaming destination. We're in guidebooks. You can't do this... you can't do this to me...
The tribe is concerned that many of your... new ideas are not resulting in any new venues.
Thanks, sister. How are ya.
Having romance problems, Romeo?
Gonna walk out of this shitstorm and right into her arms.
What if she sees you, man, sees what you look like... and it's not there. You just don't do it for her.
You're taking my money. Switch seats with me. Switch seats with me if you're not taking my money --
There is no other table --
Thanks, don't mind if I do.
I'm sorry man, I shoulda picked you up personally at the pen. This whole week's just been crazy. I've had my head up my ass the entire time.
Funny you should mention it. That's what your father and I been talkin' about.
Seymour Scagnetti.
He is a motherfucker. He won't let me leave the halfway house till I get some piece of shit job.
I don't wanna lift crates.
Holy shit, this guy's all fucked up!
We can work this out, can't we?
Daddy, I'm sorry, I don't know what's happening.
So he'll tell us who the fuck set us up.
It's not the black Beverly Hills, it's the black Palos Verdes. Anyway, this chick, Elois, was a man-eater- upper. I bet every guy who's ever met her has jacked off to her at least once. You know who she looked like? Christie Love. 'Member that TV show "Get Christie Love"? She was a black female cop. She always used to say "You're under arrest, sugar."
...What bar?
Who, Mr. White?
Yeah.
Yeah.
What?
What?
Something funny that happened to you while you were doing a job.
How's freedom kid, pretty fuckin' good, ain't it?
Who's your parole officer?
I just want you to know, Joe, how much I appreciate your care packages on the inside.
Mr. Blue's dead?
I'll take care of this, you guys leave the tip.  And when I come back, I want my book back.
Okay ramblers, let's get to rambling. Wait a minute, who didn't throw in?
He don't believe in it?  You don't believe in it?
Freddy Newendyke.
What's my problem? Yeah, I gotta problem. I gotta big problem with any trigger-happy madman who almost gets me shot!
Look, I don't wanna be a fly in the ointment, but if help doesn't come soon, I gotta see a doctor. I don't give a fuck about jail, I just don't wanna die.
Hey, bless your heart for what you're trying to do. I was panicking for a moment, but I've got my senses back now. The situation is, I'm shot in the belly. And without medical attention, I'm gonna die.
Uhuh, uhuh, what's I tell ya? That sick piece of shit was a stone cold psycho.
Have you guys been listening to K- BILLY's super sounds of the seventies weekend?
I don't believe in it.
Waitressing is the number one occupation for female non-college graduates in this country. It's the one job basically any woman can get, and make a living on. The reason is because of tips.
As opposed to good?
Well, you better start thinking about it. Cause I, sure as fuck, am thinking about it. In fact, that's all I'm thinking about. I came this close to just driving off. Whoever set us up, knows about this place. There could've been cops sitting here waiting for me. For all we know, there's cops, driving fast, on their way here now.
What's wrong with it?
Tagged a couple of cops. Did you kill anybody?
Could you believe Mr. Blonde?
I don't wanna kill anybody. But if I gotta get out that door, and you're standing in my way, one way of the other, you're gettin' outta my way.
That's the way I look at it. A choice between doin' ten years, and takin' out some stupid motherfucker, ain't no choice at all. But I ain't no madman either. What the fuck was Joe thinkin'? You can't work with a guy like that. That motherfucker's unstable. What do you think? Do you think he panicked, or ya think he's just trigger-happy?
I think he's a sick fuckin' maniac! We're awful goddamn lucky he didn't tag us, when he shot up the place. I came this fucking close -  to taking his ass out myself. Everybody panics. When things get tense, everybody panics. Everybody. I don't care what your name is, you can't help it. It's human nature. But ya panic on the inside. Ya panic in your head. Ya give yourself a couple a seconds of panic, then you get a grip and deal with the situation. What you don't do, is shoot up the place and kill everybody.
That was the plan, we meet here.
I swear to god I'm fuckin' jinxed.
So what do you suggest, we go to a hotel? We got a guy who's shot in the belly, he can't walk, he bleeds like a stuck pig, and when he's awake, he screams in pain.
Assuming we can trust Joe, how we gonna get in touch with him? He's supposed to be here, but he ain't, which is making me nervous about being here. Even if Joe is on the up and up, he's probably not gonna be that happy with us. Joe planned a robbery, but he's got a blood bath on his hands now. Dead cops, dead robbers, dead civilians... Jesus Christ! I tend to doubt he's gonna have a lot of sympathy for our plight. If I was him, I'd try and put as much distance between me and this mess an humanly possible.
Then. That time has passed. Right now, Mr. Blonde is the only one I completely trust. He's too fuckin' homicidal to be workin' with the cops.
Hello Graham -- Joe -- Mr. Gardner.
Tell them to come on in.
But I'm going to have to leave 'em here. They're --- well they're not the sort of people you're used to.
Did you ever try taking a bunch of horses over Sonora Pass? It's quite a job.
But you eat, don't you?
Mostly, we open a can of beans and boil some coffee.
Of course it'll work. You can get another girl to fill out the act.
I don't know. I thought I did. Now I'm not sure. I thought it had something to do with me.
If you want to go on, I can make it all right.
Some of 'em you didn't mean but most of 'em you did. I don't blame you because I understand your way of thinking and why you think that way. You want your women on pedestals. But they have to be born on 'em -- they can fall off but they can't climb back up.
I'm fool enough to believe that one of these days somebody will. Somebody who wants me as I am will maybe walk into the place where I'm working and take me out of there.
Where you going?
Then don't come sneakin' around a man's camp.
You might tell a fellow things, 'specially if the fellow's your brother, seems to me.
No call to. That jail looked pretty solid to me.  How's she feel?
What was he in jail for?
The other fellow wasn't even lookin'.
They were quite a ways off and the wind was blowin'. I didn't have them to aim.
Oh... that's the time you went away.
Half of them are mine.
Is that the only reason you came back?
Yeah -- but don't make a habit of it.
I said I didn't care.
I'm not going anywhere. I'm staying here where I belong.
Not exactly. They decided gambling and dancing were bad for people.  Can I make it?
Goodbye and thanks.
And we're running out of that.
Give it back to him. We're leavin'.
I'm sure of this. But not of you.  You won't open any joint. I've been watching you change. You're mad now and you think you can change back. But you can't. You'll end up making beds in a boarding house.
How far up the trail?
What for?
One night more won't matter. Your friend'll be there. Anyway I don't think so much of the idea of prowling around his ranch. He knows you're out so he ain't going to sit still for it.
Your brother's always looked after you, hasn't he?
I sure would.
Good night, Miss Wells.
What comes after Z?
What do they look like?
Hmmm... sort of like a horse -- with a horn in the center of its forehead.
Kind of tough, I guess... But you're not liable to hunt them -- I don't think there's any alive now, anyways -- and I'm not sure but I don't think there ever were...
I think he wants me.
That's it.
I meant you're into ghosts.
Oh, yeah. I'm just curious about that kind of stuff.
Then what kinda stuff can we do?
Let's get outta here.
Yeah, I think I'm bleeding.
Oh, Buddy, I was thinking the same thing. It might be our last night in this house. And I think we should take full advantage of it.
There's something I really want to share with you.
I know, but I've been thinking --
Listen to me I --
Good-night, Cin. I'll be next door if you need me.
Tell me, Cindy. Would you ever tell me "Stop. If you loved me you'd stop."
Would you like me to help you pass them back?
What the hell are you doing?
My child you are the only survivor.
Okay, I guess. It's so intimidating. You know being away from home, not knowing anyone. I feel like such a geek sometimes. Everyone's so cool and I'm so not.
Uh, uh.
I'm going to work in Washington, Cindy.
Let me help you.
Yes. The scored all over the Kiersey Temperament Sorter just like you asked for.
Cindy Campbell. Classic abandoned personality disorder. She seems guarded, but willing to do this.
I have taken care of everything, including medical supplies and blood storage. We want to be safe.
That one.
I can do it myself.
I came as fast as I could, but at my age the little soldier needs a lot more thumpin before it starts pumpin. If I tickle my ass before...
It's okay. I understand.
Remember, don't ask her too many questions.
It says, "Ray."
I'm totally freakin' dude. I keep having these nightmares, then I wake up screaming with these awful back spasms. I can't take it anymore, man.
BLOOD FEAST!
Chip, honey?
You kids. Now Birdie, I want you to have a cookie and then run along home.
But Mom, the video's not over.
That's right.
We hope so, son. And no matter what your mother is, we'll love her anyway.
He goes to college with me!
That's nice.
You bring me such peace...
Goddamn you! STOP CALLING HERE!
Let me check the zip - 212 Fuck you?
MOTHERFUCKER!!
It's not fair!!
State your name, please.
You want me to keep that under the table for you?
Beverly, honey, you've got some...  ...do-do on your shoe.
He's a good boy.
What is it, Betty?
You know who I am, August?
You can?
You think my sister is there?
Yes, I understand.
Drink.
Are you Dr. Louis Judd?
Yes.
Tell me, how is Jacqueline?
Why, Mary --
Hello, Frances.
How's Miss Jacqueline?
Nothing's happened to her. It's just that I can't understand her not getting in touch with you.
I can't understand it at all.
"The Dante?"
But I like teaching school.
What did she want?
No...At the morgue they told me a Mr. Gregory Ward had made inquiries about Jacqueline.
The Morgue? No wonder you fainted.  I wish you had come to me first.
This is about another murder —— a woman at Fifty Second Street
I'm sorry. I didn't intend to treat you like a child.
But you have treated me that way.
Please —- I can't explain things like this to your right ear.
She's got to be found. That's the first step. She's got to be found so that she can give herself up to the police.
Any court in the land would understand. We'll wait a few days -- let you rest -- then we'll go to the police.
But I'm better than a detective. I have an understanding of people - and a love of them -- an understanding of the city - -
All very nice but, what are you going to do - listen at every house in New York for Jacqueline's voice?
I have been at the library.
I can imagine.
My window - - through which I see the world.
What's wrong, Mary?
Jacqueline. Mr. Romari phoned me. She went out this afternoon with two men he'd never seen before.
I wouldn't want to take them out. I just want to look at them.
Where is Jacqueline Gibson?
I've lost my knack.
I hope it finds as much favor as your other book -- but somehow I doubt it -- the time is out of tune.
I'm afraid this is no time to play Cyrano, my friend. What was in your mind?
I suppose, Jason, that you'll speak for your friend --  -- and your poetry will speak for you.
If you like, I'll go with you to dinner.
Don't be so amazed. It's a very ordinary matter. I'm Jacqueline's physician... Mr. Ward told me you were in town and Jacqueline has sent me to bring you to her.
You know where she is?
I know the theory behind the movement. If one believes in good one believes in evil. If one believes in God, one must believe in the devil. And an intelligent person can make his own choice —— that's it, isn't it?
I never thought you did.
There's nothing you can think of -- old letters, anything, that might give me some hint as to where I might find Jacqueline?
I'll be out in a minute.
Why?
Once you'd seen my sister you'd never forget her.
She's not been here for a long time.
I have written repeatedly to Mrs. Redi. She vouchsafes no information whatsoever.  It is six months since your tuition has been paid, Mary. Naturally, it is impossible for you to stay on here as a paying pupil.
Yes?
Children, I want you to be very good and very quiet while I see Mrs. Wheeler a moment. She's going to take over this class for a while.
Why
I can quote it fully, Mrs. Redi. "We will avoid violence. For once undertaken, violence becomes its own master and can lead to either good or evil."
I have taken care of Mary. I've spoken to her. She's going back to school.
Sorry. I'm nervous. This is very trying for me.
What about it do you like? I'm not being critical, I'd really like to know.
...free-lance. You know.
Oh, uh-huh.
Yes. I was surprised that he accepted when I asked if I could stay here until I found a place.
Yeah, I know. I mean, I'm not saying I know people think you're a bitch, I'm saying I know what you mean. And I don't even know that people think you're a bitch. Do they?
It's up to you. But I warn you, if you tell me something personal, I might do the same.
As long as it's not... gross, you know? Like some scar or something. It has to be like mine, like something about you.
Well, I've been watching you. I've watched you eat, I've watched you speak, I've watched the way you move, and I see somebody who is extremely conscious of being looked at. I think you really believe that people are looking at you all the time. And you know what?
So you don't believe in therapy?
So since I've never had sex with you, by your own advice I shouldn't accept your advice.
Hi!
Nothing I can't finish later.
Oh, just a personal project like anyone else's personal project. Mine's just a little more personal.
Yes.
You just ask them questions?
To you?
I know.
She said it on her tape.
But even if we had been speaking, I wouldn't have told you.
Do you think that's such a good idea?
When we're making love?
I don't see what difference it makes, I mean, I can think what I want.  I don't know if I want to do this anymore, I'm afraid... I don't mind answering the questions so much, but if somebody were to see this...
You said you weren't always impotent.
How come?
I'm babbling.
But I don't understand --
Come on!!
But why can't you just put it all behind you? Can't you just forget it? All that stuff you did?
Tuesday. I had a late lunch.
If I'm right, I want to know. I don't want you to lie. I'd be very upset, but not as upset as if I'd found out you'd been lying.
For God's sake, Ann, I am not fucking your sister. I don't find her that attractive, for one.
But I'm not.
I'm not either!!
Goddam right. I mean, can you imagine: "Your honor, I'm positive this man is guilty. I can't place him at the scene or establish a motive, but I have this really strong feeling."
You've made your point.
I don't, either. I mean, Cynthia, of all people. She's so...
Quitting your therapy won't feed the children of Ethiopia.
Yes, I remember. What do you do when these moods overtake you?
When did you begin having this feeling?
Perhaps he senses your hesitance at being touched.
What do you mean, like physically?
What?
Ann, you always underestimate me.
He's not getting a phone, he doesn't like talking on the phone.
And what?
Good. Now, if you'll pardon me, I have to go to work.
Well, what? Is he dangerous?
No. I don't think they all did what I did.
You are in serious trouble.
Thank you.
Do you have my work number?
I'm Cynthia Bishop.
And you ask questions, right?
Do I sit or stand?
My first sexual experience or the first time I had intercourse?
Your first sexual experience.
Yes.
Okay.
I have a friend coming in from out of town, I'll probably be spending some time with him the next couple of days.
Meaning we'll have to cool it for awhile, right?
John?
Nothing wrong with trying.
Jesus Christ. And he doesn't have sex with any of them? They just talk?
Why not?
No.
No, he didn't put me up to this. Jesus, I don't need people to tell me what I should do. I've just been thinking about things, that's all.
Get rid of the car when you get your apartment, then you'll still have one key.
So is my wife, asshole!!
Mr. Forman would like to see you in his office.
Okay, in a minute, I'm on with a client.
Sure.
No, nothing.
And that was her. Annabelle Horse... field.
Medical clinic?
But where are you going?
We live in 703.
It's Dr. St. Luc, Mr Spergazzi. Let me speak to the nurse, please.
You put the bug into the body of a man with a diseased kidney, the bug attacks the bad kidney, dissolves it, it's assimilated by the body, and now you got a perfectly good parasite where you used to have a rotten kidney. I know what you're gonna say. You're gonna say it's crazy.
I don't get it.
I've got a date with one of them at ten. Can you make it?
Yeah? What do I do then?
OK. It's apartment 1009, South Tower, Starliner Towers. May as well go there directly.
Later, Brenda.  Ah, Bert, could you spare a moment?
How's Brad?
But...how?
I am in Farley's employ -- and...  ...we're discussing a network deal.
Why Janet?
In my time they used to call me the Merlin of Berlin.
With Fast Food Farley at the helm it'll be TV dinners from now on.
Judge Wright?  Now, Betty? First name terms, surely!
Macy Struthers -- God I must have been blind -- still, the weaker the man, the dumber the blonde.
I bet that Macy Struthers had a hand in this.  We'll probably be replaced by an hour of fashion tips!
A 'stately pleasure home' indeed.
I don't want to get up there.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR THE FASHION
Absolutely correct.
Could you tell us a little about it?
Let's just say that I'm putting sanity back on the national menu.
But they only think they're happy.
Hey!  What are you trying to do?  Get yourself committed?
YOUNG BLOOD
No!  He's never done that before.
Brad has deep feelings of hostility towards you.
Is it true they're all midgets with big heads?
. . .For his own good.
Flavors!
OH ROMANCE IS NOT A CHILDREN'S GAME...
LIKE A DEEP PLUM LIPSTICK AND SOME THERAPEUTICS
Mommy and Daddy love you, Baby.
We love you, Baby.
I don't know. You just seem really familiar to me. Never mind. Enjoy your meals.
You picked him up and you fucked him, didn't you, bitch?
I don't know, Christine. Perhaps it's because I feel attacked.
Miles.
Hey, Evelyn, it's your favorite client.
So I guess that's it.
Gary.
Hi.
Come on. You're fucking hungover.
Shut up.  Here's to a great week.
Yes. Absolutely. Despite your crass behavior, I'm really glad we're finally getting this time together.
Just tell me.
I liked it a lot. A lot of improvements. It just seemed overall, I don't know, tighter, more... congealed or something.
It'd be the best thing for you. You know what? I'm going to get you laid this week. That's going to be my best man gift to you. I'm not going to give you a pen knife or a gift certificate or any of that other horseshit.
No. No. You've been officially depressed for like two years now, and you were always a negative guy anyway, even in college. Now it's worse -- you're wasting away. Teaching English to fucking eighth-graders when they should be reading what you wrote. Your books.
Whatever's closest, man. I need a glass.
Hey, Miles. I really hope your novel sells.
Good, yeah, it is a rose. Only this one is rather atypically made from 100% Pinot Noir.
You know, you could work in a wine store.
Hey Jack, hurry up!
I thought you said it was close. Now I'm all pitted out.
Christine's dad -- he's been talking about bringing me into his property business. Showing me the ropes. And that's something, considering how long it took him to get over I'm not Armenian. So I'm thinking about it. But I don't know, might get a little incestuous. But Mike does pretty well. A lot of high-end commercial stuff.
This gal's married to I think a Philosophy professor at UC Santa Barbara.
Jack, she's a fucking waitress in Buellton. How would that ever work?
She works for tips!
How do you know?
Shut up.
Oooh. Oh. Miles. Miles.
Get the trunk.
Aye-aye, captain.
Oh, hey, change of plans. Steph's off today, so she and I are going on a hike.
Right now.
Does she know about Saturday?
Listen, I'm going to make sure Steph and Siena get home safe, and then maybe we'll hook up with you later, okay?
She likes you, man. Stephanie'll tell you.
You know, in life you gotta strike when the iron's hot.
Nope.
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! What's the matter with you, man? SHUT UP!
Well, yeah, that's part of it. Woman finds out how I live, that I'm not a published author, that I'm a liar essentially, then yeah, any interest is gonna evaporate real quick. If you don't have money at my age, you're not even in the game. You're just a pasture animal waiting for the abattoir.
What's happening?
So tell me everything. Details. I like details.
Did you have trouble performing? Yeah, that's...
Let me use your phone.
Thanks.
Half my life is over, and I have nothing to show for it. I'm a thumbprint on the window of a skyscraper. I'm a smudge of excrement on a tissue surging out to sea with a million tons of raw sewage.
So how did Stephanie know it was Saturday? We didn't get into that with Gary.
Jesus, Jack. Jesus. And you walked all the way back from Solvang?
Big deal. We'll call right now and cancel your cards.
Hrnrnrn?
I'm doing good, good. You look great. Did you lose some weight?
Yeah, I know what you mean. It's a long drive up here. Where're you staying?
What are you drinking?
I know the winemaker. She comes in the restaurant all the time.
Hi.
So what gems do you have in your collection?
Mrnmm, yeah... but not really. It shifts around a lot. Like you also start to see everything from the point of view of the father. And some other stuff happens, some parallel narrative, and then it evolves -- or devolves -- into a kind of a Robbe-Grillet mystery -- you know, with no real resolution.
Wow. Anyway, I think it's amazing you're getting it published. Really. I know how hard it is. Just to write it even.
Like me, I have this stupid paper due on Friday, and as usual I'm freaked out about it. Just like in high school. It never changes.
Well...
I've told him. I've told him over and over, but he's out of control.
Please believe me. I was even on the verge of telling you last night, but...
Ken.
Miles, I don't care if you come to the wedding or not.
Hi, Vicki.  You look beautiful.
Should we get dessert?
A famous actor who's getting married next week.
What's wrong with the water next to your bed?
It makes me feel better.
The same windows.
I don't want you to die.
...I will.
And tell Merrill to swing away.
It's noise.
It's probably picking up another baby monitor.
How can you say that?
That wasn't the answer you wanted?
Should we turn off the lights?
He was only a year and half old.
Have they said anything about our area?
Scientists who have been persecuted for their beliefs.
Stop crying!
Don't call me Father. It's just Graham now.
It does seem kind of odd doesn't it?
They think these look like stages immediately proceeding an attack maneuver.
The book says they're probably very good problem solvers.
Howdy, Jake. What's going on here?
What friend is that?
Where were you?
Maybe we'll see you sometime.
You'll never make it.
I'm surprised to see you out here tonight.
We told Sheriff Cobb about the attack.  He said he'd... look into it.  I can't believe he's the law out here. Now I see why you all wear guns.
How's Mr. Parker doing?
My name is Emmett.
I'm just meeting a guy here and moving on. So far I haven't been able to find him.
I haven't done anything.
No hard feelings.
Yeah?
All I'm saying is, you won't trip over me if you look her up.
They run me off. They burned me out. They made it so I couldn't do. Just like Georgia. If you won't sell, they take it anyway.
I paid the government for it, all right. That don't mean much out here.  Malachi, I'm living like a wildcat in a cave in those hills. Hiding out, afraid to walk my own land.
The problem is, Emmett, you killed the wrong McKendrick.
You misunderstand. I want you out of town. In fact, I want you all the way out of my jurisdiction.
Why would they stop you?
So have I. I've got a legitimate job now. I can use a guy like you.
I just got to town.
I'm a great believer in doing nothing.
I never could count on you to be reasonable.  Don't force me to make an adjustment around here.
What's she got to do with it?
What a waste. This could have been such a sweet deal for us.
Why'd you go into business with him?
Is this a fair mix?
From what I've seen, Paden doesn't care much about money.
Oh, no.  The fan club is real.  But they were worshipping computer code -- ones and zeros.
No, I understand.  That's what I want to talk about.  I don't know if you know this, Simone, but Viktor and I were married once.
No!  You will not give in to that blackmailing bitch!
The public decides who's on that list.
Sorry I didn't get her back in time.
Well, something has to be done about this budget.  It's completely unrealistic.  You allowed nothing for limousine service.
Experience, Viktor.  I've seen this a hundred times -- young stars destroying the very people who discovered them.  I'm worried about you, that's all.  This woman -- she controls your destiny.
I got them to remove the reflection.  The mirror's metaphor -- to show how her character's inwardly dead.
Better late than never.
Soon.  Soon.
-- It's starting to look like she doesn't support the film or you, Viktor.  If you can't handle her, I will.
I'd love to.  But aren't you supposed to meet up with Simone?
I do?
About now.  Would you like a drink?
I just read somewhere --
Oh, Viktor.  You say that now -- because we're here, alone, like this.  But in the morning, you'd go back to her.  What man wouldn't?
No, I will end my relationship with her -- totally.
How much wine have you had?
You're drunker than I thought.  Are you doing that again?
Can I see you later -- go away for the weekend?
Thank you!  I don't know how you did it but thank you.
Hello, is this Elaine?
Let's go, Lainey.  There's nothing here.
You look so, so...
Do what you do to Simone.
Yes, call me Simone.
No, I'm okay.
-- Simone, the question on everyone's mind is simply... "why?"
Clyde.
Is she here?
I have her, Mr. Taransky.  The answer to your prayers.  The answer to this.
Not like this --
Harry!  Harry!  Can we have a minute?  What brings you here tonight?
I'm going to finish the picture, sweetheart.  It's important.
She still with Kent?
Can't you stop that?
Why?
-- I know, I don't know anything.
One thing bothered me.
So that accounts for the lack of a shadow in reel six?
You know me -- married to my work.
It's the car she drove in "Eternity Forever".
I know.  Thank her for me.
No, that was me.
About you and mom?
I didn't kill anyone, Bernard, there was no one to kill!
-- No!  I can't go along with this horseshit!  Just tell them they can fry me!
Don't you have a real story to write?  Why aren't you in Latin America?
Our leaders aren't presidents anymore -- they're pop stars and screen idols.  If Woodward and Bernstein were alive today, they'd be right here in Hollywood with me.
So they're probably here.  You might be able to sell this 'disappearing act' to the rest of the world, but I'm not buying it. What's really behind this Simone woman?  The public has a right to know.  Why is she staying out of sight?  And why the hell is she with you?  I don't want you to take this the wrong way, Viktor, but you're not exactly Cecil B. DeMille -- more run-of-the-mill.
Nice boat, Taransky.
Alright, Sayer, you've got a deal.
She looks a lot like you.
Maybe he's talking to himself.
-- Nicola!  How was your massage?
Yes, of course it is.  You know you have a line here.  Not a wrinkle.  Actually, more of a dimple.  I've been thinking of incorporating something like that in Simone.
Oh, lots of things, I suppose. Bad people for one. People who wanted to imprison them. Hurt them.
You ever tell her about how it is with Tommy?
No.
How often do you see them?
It means I wasn't what everyone thought I was...  I was a fake.
Just help.
Don't get mad.
Communicate?
The last time was a Chuck E. Cheese party a year ago. He hid in one of those purple plastic tunnels and didn't come out.
I work at an insurance place and at Penny's, so Cole can go to that good school.
'Course, it's none of my business.
I'd watch your step if I were you, son.
Witch.
Rod... I have to get back to my job.
Looks like the alternator.
Yeah. It's the alternator all right.
Dammit, Carl!!!!
No shit.
I'm serious. Get this. I had a careful look at that alternator. It's clearly been messed with... it's not wear and tear that caused that breakdown...
You're saying someone's trying to keep us on the farm...?
You're not going to arrest me for it, are you?
You know, one day I'm going to have to shut down that still of yours, Jeremiah.
"Peggy-Sue" --
You're out of your mind, man.
Should we be doing this, dude?
Throw me one.
I'm not surprised. It's got a body count of zero. And no one goes around in a stupid mask, hacking innocent people to death.
Who? Us?!
Asphyxiation. Choked to death on a ham sandwich. Next.
Buzzzzzzzzzz. Sorry, wrong answer!
Bzzzzzzzzzt!
Fuck you! Fuck all of you! I'm done kickin' it with cows and roosters. -- And drinking moonshine with Johnny Cash! Senior AND Junior!
Is that right?
Time for a little... "feedback" guys. That guy from Hectic Records --
So?
We're almost ready. What the hell are you doing out here?
You wouldn't understand.
Wait a minute --
What are --
It's you. You and your father.
No --
Listen to me --
There's a place over there on the bluffs. When the fog is just right, like tonight, the lights of Main look like a kaleidoscope.
Bill, I heard what you're doing. I think I should go along.
My father, he was -- he was real close to evil. People didn't know. Still don't. From the time I was a toddler he'd beat the hell out of me. I don't mean just like a smack for smart--mouthing... he took a real enjoyment in it. And when I turned eleven or twelve, things... well, they got worse. Starla looks at Bill, who seems struck.
When I buy my zoo, I'm leaving them things the hell out!
I got to leave my post.
It's just a work thing.
I never danced in a towel before.
Just the man who's gonna see you driven to your knees! Sheriff Buell Clayton from Texas.
You're crazy, man. Smart dresser, but crazy.
Okay. I was in Texas dancing in an industrial show for Sunkist Oranges. They say I'm the new Anita Bryant. But I'm really a dancer from New York. A lot of credits. Moderate talent.  Anyway, after opening night, I was walking back to the motor lodge and suddenly there he was. A tall Texan with a twenty-nine inch waist. Pure dynamite.
I gotta get back to Atlanta in thirteen hours.
I never looked at it that way.  You ask a lot of questions.
Whaddya want to know? My sign?
Mattoon, Illinois. But I moved down south to work in the Civil Rights movement.
Seriously?!?
Shoot.
I don't know. Maybe Jerry Jeff sent the heat after us.
Your honeymoon would've never been this exciting.
Look, the truth is, I didn't want to be dumped at the truck stop. I wanted to go on with you. I needed an excuse.
Do I know? I'm an authority on it.
He's just exhausted.
No.
That means we gotta average ninety- four miles per.  Forget it.
Believe me, man; Fred'll be no problem.
How long's this gonna take?
Go.
Shit! No one's here.
I hate to say I told you so.
Bandit I, do you copy?
My vocal cords are fine, but Fred's ain't. He's been barking, eating the seats and driving me crackers.  Hear that? Where's his chow?
I'm all ears, good buddy.
But they're waiting for me. They don't even know Cledus Snow exists.
Breaker. Breaker.
Go breaker.
I would say your future's looking dim, boss.
I think you're just yellow.
Seventy-two five.  Why do you want this barley pop so bad?
Bandit two, you read me?
I still think this whole idea is dumb, pop.
Why don't we just rent a Lear jet and haul it back ourselves?
But if it can't be done, how's he gonna do it?
Oh.
So, Bill, if I understand this right, you currently have your penthouse floor under construction?
Yes, but no -- we have personnel stationed at both ends of that hall, twenty-four hours a day.
Right now? A six man security force, plus a member of our Butler staff. So seven men total.
Anything on the Swede?
And a very bad gamble.
What about the hotel staff obstructing us. Israel's obviously paid off the management.
Deputy, have you made any ID's?
Ww... uh...
Two security levels, the one we're going in under the guise of, hotel security, has restricted access. They're mostly there to monitor the lobby, handle disturbances on the different floors and toss out drunks.  There's a thirty-five member employee rotation going from graveyard to day shift. If we split up, we can blend in and enter unnoticed. Once we're inside the hotel, we'll regroup.
I left him a message.
I am. Yeah.
I dunno what to say to you sweetheart, it is what it is.
And I vibe that kiddo, I do indeed, but it's one'a those fait accompli things, you have to --
They what? What? No. No. Why?
What are you doing here?
I can't discuss --
Y'gotta, y'gotta. But d'ya think they'll kick ransom for that little prick, assuming we get to'm.
Hey, we nab Israel, they pay t'get'm back, I'll cut the fuckin' thing out m'self, no extra charge. My thing is, we crew up, let's not fuck around, someone's cousin, some Zip off the boat from Naples, let's get pros, people who know how to behave.
Chances are, they're gonna get into some shit too, hafta put people down.
Okay -- yeah, I can, I respect that.
My mamma? C'mon shorty, y'gotta ask?  You hurtin' pretty bad?
I ain't tryin' to break a sweat for that sorry ass nigga.
I ain't even goin' dignify that. You my road dog. We threw up sets.  Plus you stank.
-- It's your IFB, somebody else has got an earpiece, you're picking up their signal --
No, no, no, y'gotta go in and get him, pull'm out of wherever he at, forget all that other shit, that's just f'flavor. I'm still getting lil' bits'a this-n-that from this cat Padiche, the man contacting me... Right now, what we got --  -- Is a number and a name... Buddy Israel.
The same thing that could happen to any of us.
They shouldn't let people like you into space.
Yes.
You killed her!
No, she won't.
You fucking bastard...
How quickly?
Where's Sartorius?
Probably.
You're unnerved because you've spent your whole life thinking nobody is looking over you, and suddenly your subconscious is an open book.  We are, for the first time, experiencing changes in natural reality by a force not our own.  That proves that --
I've never heard you express any desire to leave before now.  Why now?
But why is it doing what it's doing? Given it's resources, it could have done anything.  Presented me with your double, and you with mine.
She knows everything?  Does she know she came once before and you put her in --
I want you to get Sartorius to abandon his plan.
Who are you trying to please? Yourself?  Her?  Which her, this one or that one.  Can you face both?  We are in a situation that is beyond morality.  So: Leave with her.  You'll see the transformation.
What's wrong with you?  We need your help.
Jesus...
To calm your anxiety.
You want to fuck her?
You go home.
Even a God that wasn't active, that just created something and stood back and watched?
You were trying to break down the door.  Do you know why?
Where've you been?
How old were you?
Seven, eight.  So one day my mother catches me sort of staring off into space, and she asks me what I'm doing, and I start trying to explain to her, about this state that I can put myself in, and this look comes over her face.
Thinking what you were doing and saying, just being consumed by thinking of you.  I loved it so much, that feeling.
Sartorius wants to destroy it.
Who have you been talking to?
Yes.  Especially toward the end.
Why did she do it?
You... she said I didn't love her.
Don't debate him; he'll say anything.
Rheya.
What's happening to us?
That won't happen again.  We're different.
I'm not Rheya.  You've always known that.
What do I have to do to stop it?
You exist here.  I keep telling you.
I want to stop taking those pills.
I can't --
Why do you say that?
Claire!
It's terrific Win.
You still writing the occasional magazine article?
I've never seen anyone killed before.
Uh...
Hmm...
You wouldn't happen to know what language they speak in India, do you?
So, this could be your last night, huh?
... It was like... the minute I saw her... I knew.  She looked so damn adorable in a cop's uniform... puttin' on a big, tough act...
So it was "love".
But "nice".
I'm perfectly calm, I'm a normal human being.  I'm going for a walk in the park.
I trusted you!  I thought you cared about me?!
Oh God, that's great!
Oh yeah.  When is it?  This thing in Queens.
What a memory.
I'll have to pack a lot of clothes.
... Mike.
You don't have to, now.
... He killed Win... he enjoyed it...
Think I should put the skateboard in bed with him?
Mike?
What shit, honey?
What did she say the down payment was?
She bought it.
Mike, take it easy...
What was that?
Jesus, Mike, somebody's been feeding you a line of crap.
It wasn't a bad bust.  He gave himself up because he knew I was gonna nab him.
I heard a lot... Anything you want to deny, Mike?
No One-Seventeen, they'll fuck it up!  He told me not to tell anybody, to bring Claire and come alone!  He won't wait, he knows I'm two minutes away!  Koontz, please!
... Hard?
You're not going to talk to anyone without a lawyer.
How do I know that's her?
Under the table.
Except the goddamn skateboards, which are everywhere!  I'd like to kill the guy who invented those things.
She's taking singing lessons.
What!  What kind of pathetic line is that?
Sexual tension...
You stop him?
What's in there?
Ooooh.  Your feet are on fire.
Jesus Christ.
Now tell me you love me.
Lemme down, bugface!
I don't give a gerbil's ass how you got 'em!  I can't print this surreal garbage!
How about tomorrow?
I'll hate myself in the morning for asking, but what exactly makes you any more amazing than the average jerk on the street?
Fill in the blank: "I blank Elizabeth Allan."
I hate--
I'd never admit that.
This from a girl who still plays with dolls.
Do you mind if I come too?
I'm sorry about being a jerk this afternoon.
Strong...
Hello.  So very boring.  Peter Parker, how do you feel about me this morning?
So you've found Thorkel?
Yeah, that's fascinating, but I'm just a fat, dumb cop lookin' for a psycho killer--
And he'll need a cyclotron.  He can't use ours-- he's already destroyed it.  Guard every nuclear accelerator on the Eastern Seaboard.  New Haven, Long Island, two in Cambridge--
It's a lot of ground to cover. We'll try.  Funny coincidence, huh?
No such thing as coincidence.  "God does not play dice with the universe."
A match made in heaven.
Ha.  Anti-gravitational particles.
I will finish what I've begun…
I'll repeat the experiment.  I will hold the truth. That's the only thing that matters.
Your dog ate it.
Caused by Doc Ock's experiment?
Hello, uh, Mr. Reiss?  I'm-- I'm the guy who wrestled Hulk Hogan the other day.  The guy in the mask?
Good. We'll make it oral for now. Meet me at Rockefeller Center at six tonight.
I asked if you felt like a drink--
He'll try to finish his experiment.
I wouldn't talk about things like that.
They never caught on.
You must have shot off your mouth all the way from Frankfurt to here.
Where's Hoffy? Why don't we get any news about Dunbar?
They ought to be under the barbed wire soon.
What's the matter? You on their team now? You think I'm the guy?
Private property, bub.
I suppose they also know about your distillery and the horseraces?
I wouldn't worry about Schulz. I'd worry about Sefton. Remember me? I'm the stoolie.
Here's the knife to do it with. Only make sure you got the right throat.
Cut out the guff, Schulz. We're on to you. You know everything that's happening in this barrack. Who's tipping you off?
That's the general idea.  Only it's not so general as far as I'm concerned.
Lieutenant Dunbar? It wouldn't be James Schuyler Dunbar? From Boston?
It's on me.
Let's blow, Chauncey.
You have no idea how boring my life here is. If it weren't for an occasional air raid or some foolish prisoners trying to escape, I wouldn't know what to do. I want to thank you for keeping me company. I don't drink, I don't smoke, I don't read. I hate music. That only leaves good conversation. It will be a shame to lose you.
I want to sleep. Give me five minutes on that couch.
There will be two S.S. men here tomorrow to take you to Berlin. You will be interrogated by the General Staff. When you come to the part about your arrest, I'm sure you won't forget to give me the proper credit.
Simply this. After the hostilities are ended, there will be such a thing as a War Crimes Commission. If this man should be convicted without proper proof, you will be held responsible, Colonel von Scherbach.
Say, Schulz --
Why do you do this to me every morning?
Look at me! I'm your baby!  Get a load of that blonde one! Built like a brick Kremlin!
Look at her! Isn't she beautiful! Married an orchestra leader!
Harry -- I'm blind!
So it is from the finance company. So it's better than no letter at all. So they want the third payment on the Plymouth.  So they want the fourth, the fifth, the sixth and the seventh. So they want the Plymouth.
Come on, Animal -- let's trip the light fantastic!
It's that song, Harry!
Betty! Betty!
Yes. According to the Geneva Convention, dead prisoners are to be given a decent burial.
Stay out of it, Sefton.
What's the big idea, Sefton? Take that telescope out of here.
Two packs of cigarettes say Dunbar never gets out of the compound.
You off your rocker?
Yeah?
Just one little thing. How come you were so sure Manfredi and Johnson wouldn't get out of the forest?
They're lying dead in the mud out there and I'm trying to find out how come.
I went to school with a guy named Price. But that was in Boston. You're from Cleveland, aren't you.
I thought that's what you said. You're from Cleveland. And you were with the Thirty-sixth Bomb Group?
Thirty-fifth.
Don't bother, Sefton. I don't like you. I never did and I never will.
Let us see. We have now two empty bunks here.  Nummer einundsiebzig und Nummer dreiundsiebzig in Baracke vier.
Nun? Was ist? Haben Sie's herausgefunden?
Wie hat er's gemacht?
How would you like to give Frau Schulz a pair of silk stockings for Christmas?
The one you work with. Who is he? How do you do it?
I do not want those cigarettes.
So you're stuck with me, eh?
He is.
This is its current position.
He can't go to the ribbon, so he's trying to make the ribbon come to him.  Data, is it going to pass near any M-Class planets?
Veridian III is uninhabited, but Veridian IV supports a pre-industrial humanoid society.
Wait a minute. I thought you've always been afraid it would overload your neural net.
I believe the beverage has provoked an emotional response.
During the Farpoint mission. We were on the Bridge and you told a joke. That was the punchline.
Guinan, what's going on? Where am I?
Left behind?
Soran?
Where is he now?
These are my children...my children.
Can I?
What makes you think things will be any different this time?
I'm Captain John Harriman. I'd like to welcome you all aboard.
Well, may we have a look around?
This clock, I gave this clock to Bones.
No, no, it's not. It's better.
Antonia?
Close to retirement?
How can I argue with the captain of the Enterprise? What was the name of that planet=8A Veridian III?
Yes.  Thank you.
I'm not going  Scotty, help me with this chute.
We think they were looking for something- they practically tore the place apart.
I'm afraid I can't just leave it at that. The commanding officer of this ship is clearly distraught about something. As ship's counselor, it's my duty to-
Trilithium?
Plasma coils...is there any way we can use that to our advantage?
Will we get another ship?
Shall I alert Dr. McCoy?
Calm yourself, Bones.
You did great, Bones... Just great.
I'd swear something was there sir, but I might have imagined it.
What did you see, Chekov?
Aye sir, coding now.
Could it be Spock's?
David... Sorry I'm late.
David, I don't understand...
Sector two... Indicating desert terrain. Minimal vegetation, temperature thirty-nine point four.
You must be very proud of what you and your mother have created.
Short range scan.
It would seem that Grissom was destroyed by an enemy attack.
It's time for total truth between us.  This planet is not what you intended, or hoped for, is it?
It will be hardest on Spock. Soon he will feel the burning of his Vulcan blood.
I'll go...
Aye, sir, she's got her second wind now.
What's wrong?
Yes, Admiral. But that may not be possible.
We are secured from Warp Speed... Now entering Genesis Sector of Mutara Quadrant.
Yes. Enough energy to hide a ship, wouldn't you say?
Standby automatic approach system ... Advise approach control.
Good evening, Commander. Everything ready?
Jim, the Enterprise is twenty years old. We think her day is over...
Yes. Exhilarating, isn't it!
You missed the point, then and now... Only his body was "in death," Kirk! And you were the last one to be with him.
Yes, I was...
Because he asked you to! He entrusted you with his very essence -- with everything was not of the body. He asked you to bring him to us -- and to bring that which he gave you: his Katra. His living spirit.
What must I do?
You must bring them to Mount Selaya -- on Vulcan. Only there is the passage possible. Only there can both find peace...
I give two minutes. For you, and your gallant crew.  Take every last man: form a boarding party, armed heavily!
My Lord... what are your orders?
But it's damn irregular. No destination orders, no encoded i.d...
I don't dispute that in the wrong hands --
Four hundred years old. You don't find many with the lens still intact.
Bull. You're hiding -- hiding behind the rules and regulations --
Is that a poem?
This? It took the Starfleet corps of engineers ten months in space suits to tunnel out all this. What we did in there -- we did in a day. David, why don't you show Dr. McCoy and the Lieutenant our idea of food.
Captain, this is the garden spot of Ceti Alpha VI --
Beyond what I told you, sir, it is classified information.
To Doctor Marcus, the civilian director of the experiments on Space Laboratory Regula I.
So am I. My friends were killed, too.
I was wrong about you. And <u>I'm</u> sorry.
Is that what you came here to say?
They won't --
Thirty seconds...
Goodbye, Admiral. Oh, and don't count on Enterprise. She can't move. My next act will be to blow her out of the heavens.
You are in a position to demand nothing, sir. I, on the other hand, am in a position to grant nothing. What you see is all that remains of the ship's company and the crew of the <u>Botany Bay</u>, marooned here fifteen years ago by Captain James T. Kirk.
Save your strength, Captain, these people have sworn to live and die at my command two hundred years before you were born. Do you mean he...  ... never told you the tale? To amuse you, Captain? Never told you how the <u>Enterprise</u> picked up the <u>Botany Bay</u>, lost in space from the year 1996, myself and the ship's company in cryogenic freeze?
Captain... We're waiting. What's the delay?
Just barely, sir.
I'll need ten minutes, sir, 'til the radiation dissipates.
Enterprise to Reliant. Come in, Reliant.
No, sir! You'll flood the whole compartment...!
Oh do you? Have you any idea, Midshipman Preston, how many times I've had to listen to Mr. Scott on the Comm, telling me his troubles? Have you any idea the ribbing I've had to endure in the officers' mess to the effect that the Enterprise is a flying death trap?
I assume you are loitering here to learn what efficiency rating I plan to give your cadets.
The <u>Kobayshi Maru</u> scenario frequently wreaks havoc with students and equipment.  As I recall you took the test three times yourself. Your final solution was, shall we say, unique?
She's half Romulan, Jim. The admixture makes her more volatile than -- me, for example.
Hrummm... and where are you off to, now?
There's a first time for everything, Admiral.
That is wise. In any case, were I to invoke logic, logic clearly dictates that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.
The power of creation --
Have they proceeded with their experiments?
Is it possible their COMM system has failed -- ?
Uhura! What's happening? Damn it...
Sir -- we won't leave you behind...!
Permission to speak candidly, sir?
I don't believe this was a fair test of my command capabilities.
May I speak, sir?
Reliant's command...
If Stage Two was completed, it was underground -- she said it was going to be underground.
Time from my mark...
I am delighted; any chance to go aboard Enterprise, however briefly, is always an excuse for nostalgia.
Admiral on the bridge --
Project parabolic course to avoid entering Neutral Zone.
He's not what I expected, Sir.
Spock. Does the good of the many outweigh the good of the one...?
Heard there was some excitement.
I know. I feel the same thing. But we're between a rock and a hard place. We can't keep them without risking their lives and we can't let them go without a taking the same chance.
Yeah.
Professor Scott, I'm Dr. Nichols, plant manager. I'm terribly sorry but there's been an awful mix-up Would you believe I was never told about your visit?
Back home, we call him the miracle worker.
Bones, stay here.
Now wait just a damn minute.
He's coming 'round, Jim...
I did not have time on Vulcan to review the Philosophical disciplines.
You're joking...!
Angels and ministers of grace, defend us.
... Best shot...?
They like you very much. But they are not the hell your whales.
Are you sure it isn't time for a colorful metaphor?
Why's that?
Uh huh. What about you? Where you from?
A landlubber. Come on, what the hell were you boys really trying to do back there? Was it some kinda macho thing? If that's all, I'm gonna be real disappointed. I hate that macho type.
Go ahead.
Or believe, I'll bet.
You know, I could take those whales somewhere they wouldn't be hunted.
My whales? Where could you take them where they'd be safe?
... Who are you?
All right. The truth?
Jesus, you are persistent.  Okay, your friend was right. Gracie is not only pregnant, she is very pregnant... At noon tomorrow -- in what is sure to be a media circus -- the whales get shipped out.
So. There we are.
What kind of spaceship is this, anyway?
All right. The frequency is 401 megahertz.
You tricked me.
He means our chances of getting home are not very good. You might have lived a longer life if you'd stayed where you belong.
Jim, Spock, Jim. Remember...?
Not with this equipment. I have had to program some of the variables from memory.
There is a 20th Century possibility.
How do you know this...?
Oh, the complete works of Jacqueline Susan, the novels of Harold Robbins....
Why not?
The tank will be finished by morning...
They did, Admiral.
... Aye sir...?
Let's see what she's got, Mr. Sulu.
What is it?
Estimate range, ship to whales!
Not good enough, Scotty. You've got to do better!
I'll have to re-energize.
The explosive override -- ?
Ah, what else indeed? Let me put it another way: how thick would a piece of your plexiglass need to be at 60 feet by 10 feet to withstand the pressure of 18,000 cubic feet of water?
Hi.
Oh, here and there.  I flew something similar in my Academy days.
They are my friends.
Ojichan? Akira ojichaan dewa naino? Koko de nani shiteru no?  
You don't live up to your reputation as an offlander, Picard.
This is a school... that's a student's work.  She'll be ready to become an apprentice soon. Then, in thirty or forty years, she'll take her place among the artisans...
An apprentice for thirty years.  We've noticed your people's mental discipline. Did that develop here?
You're what?
I understand.
Perhaps it would surprise you to know that I have often tried to imagine what it would be like to be a child...
Sometimes I do.
For what purpose?
Tournel will take you the rest of the way...
Can he breathe under water?
Are they in any danger?
Not at all. They're fine... in fact, they're better than fine. Increased metabolism, high energy, improved muscle tone. We should all be so lucky.
Will he live?
Hello, Data...
I believe the boy is... afraid... of me.
Until this week, that young man probably never saw a  machine, let alone one that walks and talks...
Your self-restraint puzzles me, Admiral. You continue to deny yourself every benefit this mission has to offer...
Your android has turned dangerously violent, Captain... Considerable damage was done to my ship. He must be destroyed.
What kind of concerns?
Your "Briar Patch" turned out to be more hospitable than I expected.
... or understand that they were participating in the outright theft of a world.  I won't let you move them, Admiral. I'll go to the Federation Council...
Delay the procedure. Let my people look at the technology.
Do you know how to disable the injector?
Commander, if one of their weapons hits that gas...
What's inside that nebula cluster?
The Council has ordered a halt to the Ba'ku relocation while they conduct a top-level review.
I wish there was a way to bring them back home.
I... I must have slept through my alarm. I'm on my way...
Come out, come out wherever you are...
Sir, if we fire a tachyon burst, it may force him to reset his shield harmonics. When he does, we could beam him out...
Direct hit. He's resetting his shield harmonics...
Do you know Gilbert and Sullivan?
What are they interested in...?
Nomadic, collectors of precious metals, jewels...
It's Cochrane.
Yes. But until then, you'll have to make do with what you've got.
You think they're still up there?
Have you ever wondered what it's like to have flesh?
You're becoming more human all the time, Data. Now you're learning how to lie.
Yes...
Can you configure it?
Juice?
How serious is the damage?
No... the door's too thick.
ATR setting...
It wasn't a trick. I used to be an electrical engineer.
And what were you doing out at the missile silo?
There is no invasion...
Ah... yes... but, I didn't realize that --
What?
A key piece of the ship has been destroyed... and our only hope to reconstruct it is if one of your photographs shows us what it looked like.
And all I'm asking for is the truth. That would take five minutes.  For all I know, you caused the explosions at the silo... and now you're trying to steal Zephram's ship.
I have to...
Why?
Captain, there are five Borg ships closing in on our position.
Report.
Casualties are light, Captain. Minor buckling on the port nacelle. Nothing serious.
We have to stop them from sending that message.
Just a little queasy...
Report!
Report.
Wil... Data was down there.
I remember it made me sick.
No response.  I'm not reading any Starfleet com traffic in this entire sector.
That cunning little Vulcan...
If they're even looking for us...
I don't wonder. Stop me if I'm wrong but do we really have any way of knowing if this is the real you?
My God, what happened here?
You were demoted...
Yes.
She's here - somewhere.
They're preparing to fire.
Send to commander Enterprise: "We stand ready to assist you. Captain Sulu, USS Excelsior." Attach our co-ordinates.
He's got it.
How did you know...?
Where do we come in?
Aft thrusters -
Plot a course for Kronos, Lieutenant.
Come on, Saavik, you COULD knock -
We're almost at the rendezvous - I thought you'd want to know...
I gather you are not enthusiastic about the assignment... I don't think many on board are.
I'm getting underway now. But you should know, I'm in alpha Quadrant. The chances of my reaching the conference in time are slim.
I believe the Captain feels that Starfleet's mission has always been one of peace -
Curiously it appears to emanate from us.
You were right: it was arrogant presumption that got us into this situation. You might have died.
But I am not human. I am only -
It's pretty chaotic over there. There's been some weapons fire and a lot of shouting...
Gorkon's own man??
Sir, I speak to you as a kindred intellect. Do you not recognize that a turning point has been reached in the affairs of the Federation?
But we can't allow them to be taken back to Kronos as prisoners.
Not as yet, sir.
Commander Uhura has been experiencing technical difficulties sir.
I have confirmed the location, sir, but...
At least we must keep track of where they are taken, sir. I -
You can check the torpedoes visually, if you like -
There was an enormous neutron energy surge.
Too far off. Very near us. Perhaps... underneath us...
And they'd be right. We have no evidence - just a theory that happens to fit the facts...
Under impulse power she expends fuel like any other ship. We call it "Plasma" - I do not know the Klingon name for it, but by any name it is merely ionized gas.
Can you tell me how you came to be on the planet where we found you?
Do you know where you are?
No.
A bit less florid, Data.
They are trying to override the access codes. Reman is really a most complex language with pictographs representing certain verb roots and...
How many of you did Dr. Soong make?
It's you.
If you wouldn't mind.
Really, Captain, it was a lovely toast.
Do you have a moment, sir?
You're speaking of emotional investment?
Counselor?
But how can he? He'll kill you.
He can never know you as I know you... He can never touch you as I touch you.
No.
I read six distinct positronic signatures, spread out over a few kilometers on the surface.
He's getting his cloak back. We have exhausted our compliment of photon torpedoes. Phaser banks are down to four percent.
No!
Sir, we've had an unauthorized access into the main computer.
Worf, prepare a full phaser spread, zero elevation. All banks on my mark. Scan for shield impacts and stand by photon torpedoes.
I appreciate your concern, Number One, but I've been itching to try out the Argo.
Captain, you have an Alpha Priority communication from Starfleet Command.
We have to assume he had Romulan collaborators.
A coup d'etat?
Not very chatty.
Unless we can disable his cloak we're just going to be firing in the dark.
Anything.
And you're not as we imagined you.
It's not quite the face you remember.
A lifetime of violence will do that. My nose was broken four times. And my jaw... But so much is the same. The eyes, you recognize the eyes.
Yes. The eyes have it.
Yes.
If there's one ideal the Federation holds most dear it's that all men, all races, can be united. From the first time the Vulcans came to Earth we've sought a future of peace. Nothing would make me more proud than to take your hand in friend- ship. In time. When trust has been earned.
What are you doing?
You can't trace my holographic emitters, Captainn. So don't bother. And you can't contact Starfleet. We're quite alone.
To accept your surrender. I can clearly destroy you at any time. Lower your shields and allow me to transport you to my ship.
I know... you'll all gladly die to save your home world.
Long ago.
What about Picard?
Intruder alert!
The bond is broken.
For the moment.
Benny, there's nothing there.
Don't you think you should call a backup?
Sure.
Do you have a good map of Death Valley?
Food. Eat. I prepare food. I work as a cook. That's how I make money.
I make maps.
Make any money?
Thank you.
Where did you stop last?
Stay right there...
It's a copy of the plaque NASA sent into space on the Pioneer probes.
Not necessarily bad! If they knew we were here why didn't they let us know they were coming?
Don't let them do it this way, George. It's too important. We can't find this thing alone.
George, we've just confirmed the existence of the live extraterrestrial.
Dammit Shermin. Earlier you were asking for help. What's changed?
We don't know what else to do. We need results.
You'll get results one way or the other, that's for sure... Okay.
We have a new directive. I'm taking over.
Gear shift.
Which way?
What?
What?
No gas.
It's closed... closed. We need one that's open.
Who is he? Who is she? Who are you? Who am I?  Who are you?
I am Jenny Haydn.
Who are you?
Space?
No gas.
Who?
Shit?
I...
I want to try it.
Three nights... two days.
You'll keep the car. I'll take a bus...  Am I going up there with you... in your ship... up there?
No.
A baby is a new person?
I'd love to have a baby. But I can't...
Yes.
Don't worry. They're not going to hurt you. Come on.  Only show this to the driver. Nobody else. And don't lose it.
Don't be afraid. Do what I told you and you'll be okay.
You did? That's funny. So did we.
Oh, that's terrible. I'm sorry. Was he a good friend?
The police shouldn't have started shooting. But you can hardly blame them. You surprised them. They didn't know you were up there. When they saw you, they thought you were here to hurt us.
I like this music.
The police are waiting for you up ahead. There's a roadblock. You have to go back.
I used the last one to jump off the cliff...
Do they talk?!
Here are two quarters. When you lose these, you're not going to get anymore.
I know how to gamble now.
The cook again?
Would you put some of your singing in this for the baby?
I will.
What? No, of course not.
That's because the ones that were hurt, died. They couldn't talk to you.
Bell wants us to get down on our knees and bow.
You get that, Lyman?
They're gonna let some local cop blow him away.
Bullshit!
Very beautiful country up here...
It was kind of like clicking, maybe a language wasn't it?
It was a man though... right?
You know that's impossible!
You saw that?
I wouldn't think so.
We have nothing to talk about, Lenny.
I made my choice, Lenny.
I said, 'Yeah.  I'd even do it for free.'
You have to go.  I mean it.
It's Tran, isn't it?  This guy is poison, Faith.  Listen to me.  He's got you walled in on all sides.  And he uses the wire too much, he gets off on tape, not on you.
Maybe.
We should talk alone.
I'll set you up, get you a deck at my cost... since my thing is the software.
Sounds good.
Come on, Lenny.  You used to be good at this stuff.  Play it down. What's the perp doing?
Looks like she was holding out.
He's been cooked-off
Is he dead?
Jesus!
You must be so pleased, I followed your jellybean trail right here, like a good little chump.
Just those two loose-cannon cops running around covering their butts.
Yeah, but how'd it get to you?
Aren't you peddling your wares a little far from your usual gutter?
Greetings, gents.  So let's hear this week's sad story.
Mace, you're my friend.  I need you. Plus I'll give you 25% of what I make tonight.
Me bailing your sorry pale ass out of jail twice in the last six months.
I need my case.  It's still in the back.
Yeah.  I don't see a way out of it.
Think back about what she said. Exactly what she said.
She wanted to go out to my car, something about my car...
Lenny, give them the tape.
Bullet resistant?  Whatever happened to bullet proof?
Those two guys were cops.
Uh unh.  I won't do it.
I've got a good idea, yeah.
There's a plus side?
I don't think those cops did Iris. I think whoever Iris was wearing for killed her.
Who's Strickland?
You see Tran?
Right.  That explains it.
Was this him?
Um... he was older.
No.
...well, there was some friction: I wanted to write up my work, educate the public, but Koessler wouldn't allow it. Low felt Koessler was more interested in career advancement than catching killers. Koessler had Low reassigned to the Pacific Northwest, Seattle. You know when they say, stick it where the sun don't shine? That's where they stuck Dick Low.
Agent Duncan, there's an interstate issue up on 54, run out there.
Agents Duncan, Mackelway.  Anything new?
I hope that wasn't a joke because I can assure you, from personal experience, the FBI does not have a sense of humor.
Dylan here.
Hi there.
I'm not in the mood for Native American wisdom.
I have 6 tons.
Look...
You must get lonely. You ever think about, you know... 
He was sitting here?
I might point out, Agent Mackelway, the reason we haven't been able to crack those rooms is that you refused to share that information with us -- which is also why you were reassigned.
Let some by-the-book J. Edgar Agents go into the chat room, spook these guys with stupid questions, blow my cover? -- no way.
You refused to comply with a direct order.
Agent Kulok and I were in O'Hare when we heard.
I'm hesitant to...
I spoke with Lloyd Daitz.
"Was?"
How long ago?
I got a look in Testa's computer. His screen name was "Imelda." Have to give him that, had a sense of humor.
There was talk of a file photo.
They sort of got me on shit detail, no offense.
That's the beauty of the system. This is a fugitive chat room. It moves from place to place, chat rooms that are normally empty at certain hours: a gardening website, Chaucer buffs, a dating service. A pre- arranged code shows up in one of fifty porn rooms -- that's where I stumbled across it -- notifying "friends" to meet at a certain time, usually midnight to three Eastern Standard, at a certain website -- a deserted chat room, say, "How to Plant Perennials." Come Tuesday, twelve a.m., bingo, these like-minded deviates log on and start yakking it up: explicit sex crime gossip, who did what to whom, who wants to do what, when, why and how.
This is some serious shit.
Taking a Stryker saw, cutting off the top of someone's cranium, pulling the brain out -- what's that, a day in Spring?
Grown man dressed like a clown. Does he really think he looks good?
He thinks he looks young.
Of course he did. He came on to every attractive student. Which bothers you most: that he exploits suffering or that he came on to me?
You must really think I'm a square, a computer nerd.
It's a no-no.
I know.
Not about coming to see Daitz?
And nobody else can do that?
Don't confuse what we do with who we are.
Jaime? Where are you?
You want to get him? Find something he wants. Get him to come to you.
This feels like something out of a spy novel.
You were right. He found me.
I need something tangible. To hook him. I told him I'd found the confidential file on the Suspect Zero theory.
That's what Koessler wants us to believe. To discredit Low.
You're assigned, we're assigned, to apprehend Richard Low, not Suspect Zero. I have to tell you, Mack, I'm not comfortable where you're going.
Jaime --
No weapon.
Who are you?
Agent Mackelway?
Of course not. They're possibles. I've checked them against Bureau records, check them against your file. How did you get it?
You did. You were with her when she disappeared, right? She took you to the mall or the movies, you turn around and she's gone.
We're alike. We are hunters. We have the gift. It's ancient times all over again. We stand between order and chaos. I need help. I can't carry on alone.
Lead the way, Murman.
Johnny, get this man's file. Mackelway, right?
I wished to be reinstated at Computer Crimes. I was undiplomatic in my request.
This case has sent bells and alarms ringing all the way to Washington. Your old boss is coming out.
How far is Amarillo?
350 miles.
You've been through worse.
Ever since I've known you.
That's because it was a challenge. You has control over you're situation. It was hard, but you rose to it.
Enough. I've got to use the phone.
Do you realize that I've been waiting for that call for six months and I cut her off?
You ever go to the Kelbo's? On Pico?
...Monday nights? I host an open mike...
You're a comedian?
Hi.
Maybe it doesn't matter if he's a good dancer cause it's a slow song, if that's what he's afraid of.
No... Maybe that's not the case. Maybe she shouldn't be such a smug little shit because she'd be surprised at what a good dancer he really is, but it's been a long time and he doesn't know if he's ready to...
I haven't heard an official "no" yet.
They were auditioning for the same role as you?
Lisa works at the MGM Grand...
Oh my God.
He's so sweet. He really said that?
A couple of high rollers like you?
Could you believe it?
You want this in black chips.
Yeah, but how long was the relationship she was rebounding from?
Listen. I had a great time.
If and when I get a real gig I'll call you.
...Yeah, but entertainment law isn't something you just jump into...
Neither is acting. Not if you're serious about it.  Can I have one of these?
...It's really getting late.
...Nah. I'm right across the street...
...Six months.
How are you doing?
It doesn't matter. I think about you every day.
Pierre... That's his name? Pierre? Is he French?
I'm not home and going out of town tomorrow for a week. Can't you talk for five more minutes?
The only difference between giving up and not giving up is if you take her back when she wants to come back. See, you can't do anything to make her want to come back. You can only do things to make her not want to come back.
Right.
Right... Wait, what do you mean?
Unless she comes back first.
There's the rub.
Thanks, man. Sorry we always talk about the same thing all the time...
What do you want? You're tall.
Why?
What? Like, you didn't want to jinx it?
Oh no?
I'll give you an eight. 
To get a drink before we meet the guys for a bite at eleven.
Ah, there's the rub...
Oh, like that song...
Not well.
You asshole. Why are you carrying a gun? What? In case someone steps to you, Snoop Dogg?
What about you, Mikey? At least I got balls. You're always whining about some bitch who dumped you a year ago...
What are they doing here?
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
VEGAS.
When?
I'm serious. This is how you do it. I'm telling you.
This is the hot new place, besides, you love pirates. Tell me Mikey doesn't love pirates.
We're gonna get laid, baby.
What? You think she's gonna tell her pit-boss on us?
What?!?
Double down, baby. You gotta double down on an eleven.
...but that's two hundred dollars. This is blood money...
Yea, how much?
Baby, don't talk like that, baby.
Let's just leave.
Mikey's the big winner.
You gotta give Tee one thing. He's good with the ladies.
She likes you.
You gotta get that girl out of your head. It's time to move on. You're a stylish, successful, good looking cat. The ladies want to love you, you just gotta let them.
It's not. You're money. Any of these ladies would be lucky to pull a cat like you.
It's just tough, after sleeping with someone you love for so long, to be with someone new... who doesn't know what I like... and you gotta wear a jimmy...
Baby, you did fine.
"Age of Enlightenment". Shit. Like some waitress in a Las Vegas coffee shop is going to get an obscure French philosophical reference. How demeaning. I may as well have just said "Let me jump your ignorant bones."...
Sorry about interrupting...
I didn't even like her, to be honest.
I just don't think she liked me in that way.
No.
How you guys doing?
I'm sorry.
Was I money?
So, two days?
...against the computer.
Oh, it's on, baby...
Is she looking now?
Baby, I know it is. It's a black diamond trail...
...I used to wait two days. Now everyone waits two days. Three days is kinda money now, don't you think?
...Anaheim...
Have you gotten laid once since you moved here? Did you fuck once?
I'm telling you. Wait three days...
...Well, then, I guess we don't have to worry about him anymore.
The Don himself is coming to me tonight?
No.  You ask for too much.
Understood.  I just wish I was doing more to help out.
How many times did he stay home the last couple of months?
Maybe three, four times.  I always asked Freddie if he wanted another bodyguard, but he said no.  Things have been so smooth the last ten years...
The gun will be there.
He's going to be our lawyer in Vegas.  Nobody goes to him with any other business as of now, this minute.  No reflection on Tom; that's the way I want it.  Besides, if I ever need any advice, who's a better Consigliere than my father.
No.
Two terms; one in Italy, one in the United States.  He's known to the Government as a top narcotics man. That could be a plus for us; he could never get immunity to testify.
This morning.
My wife was weeping before she fell asleep, outside my window I saw my caporegimes to the house, and it is midnight.  So, Consigliere of mine, I think you should tell your Don what everyone knows.
He was the one behind Sollozzo?
And this?
And now, what do you choose to do?
I see you have your Luca Brasi.
Don Tommassino.
There is nothing there.  Not anymore.
You had better bring a few bottles home with you, my friend; you'll need help sleeping tonight. 
This was a beauty.  Right, Calo?
That's easy to say; it's not your father.
We're all tired...
I found out about this Captain McCluskey who broke Mike's jaw. He's definitely on Sollozzo's payroll, and for big money. McCluskey's agreed to be the Turk's bodyguard.  What you have to understand is that while Sollozzo is guarded like this, he's invulnerable.  Nobody has ever gunned down a New York Police Captain.  Never.  It would be disastrous.  All the five families would come after you Sonny; the Corleone family would be outcasts; even the old man's political protection would run for cover.  So just...take that into consideration.
Jesus, I don't know...
I'll try...It's what the Don would want us to do.
Bookkeepers know everything. Rocco's men are all a little too good for the jobs they're supposed to be doing.  They get a little more money than the job's worth.  Lampone's a good man; he's operating perfectly.
Who is he?
You really want to know?
Once upon a time, about fifteen years ago some people wanted to take over my father's olive oil business.  They had Al Capone send some men in from Chicago to kill my father, and they almost did.
Then the legs at the knees...
Michael, I love you.
Shhh, you be the long distance operator.  Here.
Michael...
When will I see you again?
You cannot stay here...I'm sorry.
You and I are going to move my father right now...to another room on another floor...Can you disconnect those tubes so we can wheel the bed out?
Oh no you can't, the old man'd be sore as hell if I let you get mixed up in this.
We can't wait.  No matter what Sollozzo say about a deal, he's figuring out how to kill Pop.  You have to get Sollozzo now.
Do you pledge to guide and protect this child if he is left fatherless? Do you promise to shield him against the wickedness of the world?
And all his works?
Barzini's people chisel my territory and we do nothing about it.  Pretty soon there won't be one place in Brooklyn I can hang my hat.
Barzini wants to arrange a meeting. Says we can straighten any of our problems out.
I think so.  Detective squad?
Right.  Don't say my name, just listen.  Somebody shot your father outside his place fifteen minutes ago.
Is he alive?
Tom was telling me about his trip over. Made me laugh so much I got a nosebleed.
I'll do it. I make a fabulous martini.
It'll just be for a little while. He can be... he makes me laugh.
He's drowning me!
It's Tom. Tom Ripley. We were at Princeton together.
Okay.  And did we know each other?
Princeton is like a fog, America's like a fog.  This is Marge Sherwood. Tom -- sorry, what was it?
Now? Okay. Wait a minute. Talent --  The only talent my son has is for cashing his allowance.
I'm never going back!
What time is it?  Oh God! Do you always type your letters?  That should be two Ts.
Could we sail to Venice?
See Venice and die, isn't that right? Or is it Rome? You do something and die, don't you? Okay, Venice is on the list.
And Rome.
Pretty vile. See this: The S and the T, do you see? -- fine, vulnerable -- that's pain, that's secret pain.
Your handwriting -- nothing more naked. See -- nothing's quite touching the line -- that's vanity.
No!
What club?
You said I could pick out a jacket and I just... Sorry.
Get undressed in your own room, would you?
You can't blame him. You could hardly expect this to go on forever.
I thought you might write again. Now that we're brothers...
I've got plans!
Of course. Let's say, for argument's sake, you were here -- perhaps we could split the rent on a house -- I'll get a job -- or, better still, I could get a place in Rome and when we're there we could be there and if we're here we could be here --
How?
What?
Freddie, do you have something to say?
Yes it is.
I feel guilty. I feel like I pushed him away. I spoke and he heard you.
I was sure we'd met, weren't you, Ted? This is Herbert Greenleaf's boy.
Mr Greenleaf appreciates your loyalty. He really does. Marge, she's got a hundred theories, but there are a few things she doesn't know. We hope she never knows.
I never said that!
Tom, I love you!  See!  I bought it for him, for his birthday.
What about Cortina?
I'd swear he didn't. Of course he didn't.
We passed it a few blocks back, where the police were. The Palazzo Gioia. They don't even know I'm in Rome and I'm not going to incriminate Dickie --
That's a terrific idea.
Tom?
I don't know. Peter has a concert in Athens next month -- and he's asked if I want to go along, help out. He says goodbye by the way -- he's in rehearsal, otherwise --
What?
I know it was you -- I know it was you, Tom. I know it was you. I know you killed Dickie. I know it was you.
Emily.  Just kidding.
Randall.
Everybody knows Freddie Miles.
I know.
Let's take a Carozza and look at the moon.
No, I absolutely understand. Of course.
Just kidding. Are you alone?
And co. A lot of co. Oh, God, I've thought about you so much.
Ho assunto io la guida delle indagini in seguito alla negativa valutazione delle disdicevoli circostanze verificatesi con il mio predecessore Roverini che come e noto non e riuscito a impedire il verificarsi della scomparsa del signor Greenleaf, il quale era l'unica persona al momento passibile di incriminazione del reato di omicidio del signor Miles.
Non e questo il luogo per le vostre conversazioni private! 
I am. I really am. And I've been travelling. I just can't seem to get that far north.
I know the Piazza di Spagna. What time?
Not at all. Morning Tom.
Anyway I've got to the bottom of the delay. Finally. We're waiting for someone from Rome.
In Rome, about three weeks ago.  I knew that one.
Probably. In my case it's probably a whole building.
All kinds of things. Making plans.
Good. But I think we should stay in here for the rest of the trip.
The telephone, the press, I've been, I'm feeling hounded -- do you think you could not give out my address?
You got a .44 Magnum?
Some of these guns are like toys, but a Smith and Wesson, man, you can hit somebody over the head with it and it will still come back dead on. Nothing beats quality.  You interested in an automatic?
How much for everything.
Nah, this'll be fine.
Huh?
It's just to the corner, mam. In broad daytime. Nothing can happen. I'll be there to protect you.
Yes?
Just people people, you know. Just people.  Had a dead man once.
I know. I could have picked you up.
I work a single, which means there's no replacement -- no second man on the cab. Six to six, sometimes eight. Seventy-two hours a week.
It keeps ya busy.
Your stereo broke? God, I could hardly stand that. I live on music.
So you haven't heard this record yet?
But this is a porno movie.
No. I just wanted to see if you could light it that way. The guy at the newsstand can.
What is your name? My name is Travis.
What ya gonna do with all that money, Dough-Boy?
One-Ball McCall?
Stick up?
Yeah. From the likes of them.
Why? Who are you?
I don't remember.
It don't matter. I'm gonna get you outta here. 
Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it!
Do you understand why I came here?
I think so. I tried to get into your cab one night, and now you want to come and take me away.
That's not hard to do.
No, I mean really. This is nothing for a person to do.
Well, you want to or not?
God, you are square.
Why don't you come to a commune with me?
Besides, I've got to stay here.
I can't say -- it's top secret. I'm doing something for the Army. The cab thing is just part time.
You a narc?
You're not much with girls, are you?
Then it's a good guess it's grounded.
No.
Say, aren't you Charles Palantine, the candidate?
No Sir.
How's your driving record?
Age?
You moonlightin?
Travis.
Shoot. They don't call me the Wizard for nothing.
You fit in. It's lonely, it's rough at first. But you fit in. You got no choice.
Stick with Carla.
He's got a gun, sir.
You'll be fine.  No matter what Leo Kubelsky says, you've got a hundred and seventy-five years of American law on your side.  Don't forget that.
I'm afraid not.  He looked right at your picture without batting an eye.  But it's probably temporary. He got all the way to Lawson, so he clearly knew who he was and what he was doing until he hit his head. I'm sure it'll all come back to him.  It just takes a catalyst.
You can all go home, now.  He's not going anywhere.
No, it's okay.  See, when two people belong together, the other person should be the... the key that unlocks the rest of you... I'm not making sense, am I?
Were we going to get married?
A loan to a man who ran his business into the ground and his son who can't account for the last nine-and-a-half years of his life? Not likely.
Nope.  Just filling in the blanks.
It never used to be.  You were two left feet on the dance floor.  Like pulling teeth to get you to do a little box step.
Mr. Appleton, do you know an "Albert Lucas Trumbo?"
Luke Trumbo?  We never met.  But I'd like to think I know him.
Now, I see that you've been running a movie theater in Lawson called "The Bijou," is that also true?
Well, I'd direct the attention of counsel and committee to line thirty-six of the document, and the name printed and signed there.
Well, that's what I knew then.  Or who I knew, I should say.  You see, I was trying to court Miss Angstrom.  I went to the meeting to impress her.
But what?
What's that?
Thanks.
We've been closed for a while.
They couldn't wait to see you.
Oh.  What... what time is it?
Ernie.
Yes?
Yes.
Dad, I...
Jesus...
You're not going anywhere, Harry.
Thanks, Jerry.  Tell me something.
Too bad.  He says I'm a communist.
Then I'll call you a cab.
What is it?
You kids off to the dance?
Well, his rent's past due and he said to call you in case of an emergency.  He lose his job or somethin'?
At least I was on our side!  Look, they want me to testify?  I'll testify.  I'll tell 'em anything they want to hear!  Jesus, Leo, this is my career!
And I won't be a communist anymore.
Luke didn't smoke.
Leo, I didn't give them the names. I wouldn't do that.
Her name was right there in front of them.  They gave it to me, I didn't give it to them.
Leo, she was... she was a girl I knew in college...
No.
Found me.
T-t-thank you.  Thank you.  I... I always... I always wanted to wear my uniform from the Great War, but your daddy, he always said no, that's not an usher's u-u-uniform, that's an army uniform and the Bijou, she's not the army.  They give me a medal, but I lost it in the h-h-hospital.  I forget things sometimes.  Since the w-w-war.
Did you think I didn't kn-kn-know that?
What exactly did you hear?
I suppose.  Thanks.
The war...
Said as much myself, Doc.  Can't place him, though.  To look at him, you'd think the cheese slid off his cracker.  Well, morning's half-over.  I'm off.
Would that be Miss Sinclair?
Yes?
They seemed sure it was either Alice or Lois.
It's a lovely garden.
Thank you. It gives me something to do with my spare time.  There's a lot of spare time in Bodega Bay.  Did you plan on staying long?
No. Just a few hours.
You're leaving after you see Cathy?
That sign.  Do you think I could have the room for a single night?
Miss Daniels? Is that you?
No, thank you.  Won't you call me Melanie?
Well, I don't suppose it offers much to the casual visitor. Unless you're thrilled by a collection of shacks on a hillside. It takes a while to get used to.
San Francisco.
When was this?
Then maybe it isn't different at all. You know, her attitude nearly drove me crazy. I simply couldn't understand it.
And what had you done?
No, I don't think so. She's not afraid of losing her son, you see.  She's only afraid of being abandoned.
She already has a daughter.
Then what are you doing here in Bodega Bay?
No, that's all right, I don't mind. I came up here for two reasons. To begin with, I was bored with my job in San Francisco. I was teaching at a private school there... well, you know, you probably went to one yourself.
I'll be going, too, to help out. It should be fun, Melanie.
It's really up to Lydia, isn't it?
Look.
Well, Mom, he's the first to admit it.  He spends half his day in the detention cells at the Hall of Justice.
Why didn't Annie stay for dinner?
Oh. Where d'you want the coffee?
Right across the bay there.
That's where the Brenners live.
Follow the road straight through town 'til it curves off on the left. That'll take you right around the bay to their front door.
Mmmm.
Mmmm.
Of course.
The little Brenner girl?
Yes?
Why not, Mrs. Bundy?
Young woman cut herself.
Shall I call the doctor?
We don't have any fog this time of year, Mitch.
You did say birds?
I told you. We met yesterday.
Forgive me. I suppose I'm just naturally curious about a girl like that.  She's very rich, isn't she?
I know, Mother.
She is the one who jumped into that fountain in Rome last summer, isn't she?
I don't know.
I don't know yet.  I think we'll be safe here.  Let's bring that wood in.
Mother! I'm trying my best!  I'm... trying... my...
They won't be.
No, it's me, Mrs. Brenner. I thought you might like some tea.
He was calling from the farm, Mrs. Brenner.
Would you like me to go for her?
All right, I'll grant you a bird'll panic in an enclosed room. But, they didn't just get in. They came in! Right down that chimney.
These birds were...
Yes.
He won't be back until Monday. I mean, if those birds are for him....
Oh.
Yes. Yes, someone's got to feed them.
Lovebirds.
Yes. I understand there are different varieties, it that true?
No, sir, those are... redbirds.
The sign says strawberry finches.
All these innocent little creatures caged up like this?
Criminal.
Yes?
Oh, no you don't!
You like me, huh?
What did it say?
Will I be seeing you again?
I'm in San Francisco five days a week. With a lot of time on my hands. I'd like to see you.  Maybe we could go swimming or something. Mother tells me you like to swim.
The truth is you were running around with a pretty wild crowd...
Yes, but...
...who didn't much care for propriety or convention or...
Why?
It is for me.
I really shouldn't have any more. I'm a little tipsy already.
I'm trying to get you to stay for dinner. We're going to have a lot of roast left over.
On Mondays and Wednesdays, I work for the Travelers' Aid. At the airport.
Nothing.  I go to bird shops on Fridays.
It smelled of the fire.
It's an uprising.
Hear, hear!
What it was, probably...
I hadn't thought of that.  And then the swifts came.
The bay doesn't.
The power.
There we are!
No, you'd better send him. May I use your phone?
I might be able to have them by tomorrow morning. Would that be all right?
They're both perching birds, of course, but of quite different species. The crow is brachyrhynchos. The blackbird is cyanocephalus.
What were the crows after at the school?
Daniels. I think they were after the children.
Have you ever seen a jay protecting a nest?
Maybe! Is it impossible?
No. I don't, Mitch. Because I can't see any reason for it.
How?
How can we go on living here if we blanket the town with smoke?
Of course.
I'm going out that way, lady. You can follow me.
Were the Santa Rosa police at your school today?  Are you coming?
Mr. Gray?
I fear he may have to.
Ask this one favor --
Good morning, Mrs. Marsh.
And did you hear them speak of the porter who testified against Burke?
Aye.
I've heard of it.
Dr. MacFarlane --
You're too good a man, Fettes -- I'll not let you quit.  I'll make an assistant of you -- that'll pay your keep and your tuition, too --
I thought only the best students were made assistants.
You know how we get the specimens we use for dissection?
I don't think I can go on, sir.
I can't believe that.
He has his own idea of a joke. Perhaps his horse tickled him in the ribs.
Dr. MacFarlane, I wonder if you know what happiness you've brought those people.
You can't -- can't!  Stop trying to bribe her with childishness about white horses. Let the child stand and walk -- her spine's all right.  I know it's all right.
But she must want to stand.  She must want to walk.
What?
Where shall we put it? In the back?
The white horse.  The horse that is going to greet me when he sees me.
I will not have you use that name to me.
Oh, it's you, Gray. Well, come in. Sit down. Have a glass with me.
I brought you something tonight, MacFarlane -- an interesting specimen -- in very good condition.
I have other means of sustenance.
But why, Gray? Why?
I have made you give me money, but you smile. Aren't you angry?
But where did they get those people?
I don't understand the song. Tell me plain how they did it.
No, Doctor.  She seemed to get better, then about six months later she began to complain of pain in her back --
Is her pain sporadic or constant?
You're daft.  What's Gray to me. He's only a man from whom I buy what I need when I need it -- the rest is forgotten.
You've been with Gray again.
How many innocent people did you leave dead back there?
You're wrong.
Lauren's father's involved. He bought the cops fancy cars, I don't know what else. It's a company called D-E-L-T. I think Lauren found out.
Keep that thing away from me.
Fuck! What do you want?
You killed her. I saw it.
You're the guy killed Dutton.
Not my arm! What you fucking want?
How can you die if you're already dead?
From the bonfire over there. Look at it.
No. You don't.
... took everything I ever cared about. Left me with nothing.
All I knew, she was pulling away. It made me crazy.
Yeah, we do.
Some hooker phoned it in. There was a riot at his apartment yesterday.
Could say that.
I watched her grow up. Just like you. I know how her mind worked. She kept snooping around because she was worried about you. What you'd gotten yourself into. So stop blaming me. And blame yourself.
I do. Every day.
If you had a license, I bet I'd have seen it by now. How old are you? Fifteen?
Look, can I just call a cab?
Stay in the car. I'll only take a second.
That guy in the cemetery today said he knew everything about Lauren.
Please. Come inside.
How can you be so sure? Have you tested this theory?
Such power exists?
Yes.
Professor Barnhardt.
Go to bed, darling. You can finish that in the morning.
Bobby -- I think it would be better if we didn't see quite so much of Mr. Carpenter
Well -- atomic power, I would imagine.
You think it can go faster than an F- 36?
All right.
Would you give me your two dollars for a couple of them?
Oh, I'd say forty-five.
He told me this morning when I examined him. He's seventy-eight.
I'd be glad to.  Not now, of course -- with you alone.
I want to meet with representatives from all the nations of the Earth.
We've been monitoring your radio broadcasts for a good many years. That's how we learned your languages. Lately, we've been getting your television also.
I'm sure you recognize from our broad- casts the evil forces that have produced the tension in our world. Surely you would agree--
Perhaps if you could explain a little--
Our problems are very complex, Mr. Klaatu. You mustn't judge us too harshly.
I am impatient with stupidity. My people have learned to live without it.
It was a wonderful day.
I will be in just a minute.
Bobby and I have had enough excitement for tonight.
Helen, he's the man from the space ship!  I had that diamond checked at three different places. Nobody on earth's ever seen a stone like that! After what Bobby told us, that's enough for me. Why is it nobody knows anything about him? Why hasn't he got any money?
That's what I'm trying to tell you. We mustn't do anything about it. Believe me, Tom, I know what I'm talking about.
He told you... Don't be silly, honey -- just because you like the guy.  You realize what this'd mean for us? I'd be the biggest man in the country. I could write my own ticket.
Naturally I think so.
Oh -- hello--
No, wait a minute -- there's someone else.
I'm worried about Gort. I'm afraid of what he might do -- if anything should happen to me.
I'm sorry.
No -- no, thanks.
In this case the secret wouldn't be worth much. He doesn't know the answer himself.
<u>I'll</u> have to drive!
We don't ride with vampires.
We've been aware of some very serious vampire activity in this town for a long time.
The Prince of Darkness.
The nightcrawler.  The bloodsucker.
The meanest!
This is just our cover.  We're dedicated to a higher purpose.
Just so you know:  If you try to stop us, or vamp-out in any way, I'll stake you without thinking twice about it.
What?
Don't go out there!  Stop him!
Dad!  Don't sneak up on people like that!
Good!
I had the dream again about <u>them</u>.
Michael, will you do me a favor this evening?  Will you stay home with Sam tonight?  I'm meeting Max for dinner after work.
Tell them to get something to eat.
Sam.  Is everything all right?
What's wrong?  Tell me.
In here?
Stop it, Sam.  Stop it right now!
This looks terrific, Lucy.
Boys Sam's age need a good deal of discipline, or they walk all over you.
No, no.  Just worrying about my boys -- as usual.
I thought you said they needed discipline?
Ouch.
Have to sleep.  Have to sleep, Michael.
Yes... and I'm to blame for it. If you hadn't met me... if I hadn't liked you... I tried to warn you...
I'm so excited I just can't hide it.  I'm about to lode control and I think I like it.
This room is mine.
Nowhere.
You're supposed to watch me and entertain me, and make me appreciate the brief but happy years of childhood.
Sixteen.
All right... Box of dynamite... box of thermite... three shotguns... box of flares... two flare guns... thirty cans gasoline... and a case of alcohol.
Yeah.
Listen to me, Garry.  Please...
Finish what?
Fuchs...?  No, it's not Fuchs... You must let me back in... I won't harm anyone... I promise...
Was dark... find a light...
Torch it over there!
MacReady!
Now how's this motherfucker wake up after thousands of years in the ice, huh?
What we going to do?!
Oh, shit!  Well, hang on!
The fire's got the temperature way up all over camp... won't last long though.
What are you doing?
I'm a real light sleeper, Childs...
Thank you.
Nothing we can do about that.
When was the last time you used it?
Gotta be from the Norwegian camp.
You reach anybody yet?
What kind of test?
He might just wait us out.
What about Childs?
You and Nauls got to block off the west side bunks, the mess hall and the kitchen.
What's happened?!
Yeah!
He's one of them.
Don't tell me you're a mud carrier.
What else can they do?
Kalen... Do you have any idea where they take them?
There's a place that might help... we could try going there.
You know of them?
But you escaped.
Excuse me?
Yes...
What can I do?  Tell me what to do.
Vox...
I don't understand.
Now get out of my sight, you hideous primate.
Alexander.
And what of the Eloi?
We have lost the capacity to reproduce.  But the species must continue.
If I can only find the right door... the lady or the tiger...
No...
Why is it -- breaking up?
Got here as soon as I could.
My God...
Heavens, look at that now!
Alex... people are staring.
... One day he'll be discovered by some future archeologists and they won't know what to make of him. The thick brow, so lacking in imagination.  The dim little eyes, devoid of curiosity.
Alex, nothing will ever change what happened, but --
You're not from beyond the valley.
How long ago?
Why not?
Don't then have stars where you come from?
Yes!
Oh very.  Learning, commerce, the arts -- the whole place was buzzing all the time.  Night and day.
Kalen...
Sir, Mr. Philby is here.
Well, just as I thought.  Surely it's all been a terrible mistake. This parent actually suggested that your freshman course in applied mathematics has somehow become a seminar on theoretical physics!
But I know that none of my faculty would ever deviate from the assigned curriculum.
No, Dr. Hartdegen, they are not just chickens and roosters.  They are science.  Perhaps they aren't "inspiring" to you.  Perhaps they don't "challenge" you --
I wonder if that poor girl has any idea what she's in for?
I think I might be.  But there'll be some changes made.  I run a tight house.
[Beat] You don't believe me, do you?
Relax.
You sure you know where to find one?
[Beat] You're his son?
Do I know you from somewhere?
He died because he bled to death from a blow to his head. Someone had to have given him it.
You two ok?
What for?
[Beat] What?
How'd he die?
It's December 25th, 1993 today.
I'm telling you I don't care what time you think you're in. You're not William Starks. [Beat] I don't believe in many things, but I believe in death. And it doesn't give back what it takes. So whoever you are...I did a nice thing, you've made me regret it enough already, so please, just leave.
[Softly] I want to trust you. Should I trust you?
Alpine Grove still exists. I looked it up on the net. We should go there and see if there's still anyone around who might have known what happened to you.
Me neither. Who was the boy she was talking about, Eugene?
I have no idea.
I might not be able to.
When we first met, when you were 7, where was the house you lived in with your mother? Do you remember your address?
You gotta stop thinking like that.
It's complicated, but [looking at Starks] in a way, your father let me know how I'd get through to him.
I guess I'd ask you why.
You may never remember at all. [Beat] Your mind's grasp of reality and the real events that have happened to you has been damaged.
I could try to...make it stop.
How...how do you know?
Who told you this?
You know how to get there?
It's gonna be sticky.
'Cause Lorenson's got her claws in it now. When she started getting suspicious about me was when they stopped using it on me. Women!
If you're deaf, read my lips...I don't need a psycho following me today.
All right. [Beat] You got somewhere you need to go, Mister?
You don't have anywhere to stay?
Well, how'd you get here?
You don't think that's crazy?
Never knew my father. I grew up with my mother. Actually, I grew up around my mother. She was great though. I mean, the way she was with her friends... She was this woman who had so much life in her, she had to find ways to kill some of it just to be like the rest of us. [Beat] She died young.
What.
Have a good day at work today.
What?!
What?
I could shoot your cousin Eddie.
On what?
That's what everybody says.  Only problem is nobody's husband was unaccounted for that night... Could you shoot Eddie in the face?  At point blank range?
That's Thelma Dickinson's husband.
He said he took it to a motel in Oklahoma City.  He also says that at that time he met a man.  He identified you through a series of mug shots.  He also told us that you and Mrs. Dickinson seemed "close." Is that true?
Well, you're not exactly an expert witness, but what makes you so sure?
Well, if I had to guess, I'd say it was some ol' gal, some ol' gal's husband.  But it wasn't either one of those two.  The tall one, the redhead, she left me a huge tip.
Alright.
Is this the guy you saw them with?
Now, for one thing, you violated your parole two days out.  And you know Judge Hainey.  He hates this sort of thing.  Once he gets wind of this, he's gonna blow sky high.  And then when he finds out that you're a possible accessory to murder and armed robbery, well, I think we can safely place your ass back in the slammer for at least the remaining eight, don't you?
He's got nothin' to gain by lyin'.  Nothin' at all.  He already got all their money.  I just don't know what we're dealin' with here. Anyway, it went out again last night on Nationwide Teletype.  Let's just wait it out a little longer.  She said she was gonna call back.  Let's just sit tight.
Hey!  Don't let them shoot those girls.  This is too much.  They got guns pointed at 'em!
I am the great and powerful Oz...
J.D.!  Just tell me.  I know you're not some schoolboy.  Now come on, nobody ever tells me shit.
I'm a robber.
Tell me.
I've always believed if done right, armed robbery doesn't have to be a totally unpleasant experience.
Louise!  Where are you?  Are you alright?  Honey...
Not yet.
No, honey.  I told him I was buyin' a car.  What is it for?
And what's the mysterious code word?
Oh my God!  Jimmy!  You... Oh my God!  What are you doin' here?
Who is it?
Can I just ask you one other thing?
What kind of stuff do I bring?
Okay.  I will, too.
'Cause I didn't ask him.
How much longer is it gonna be?  I'm hungry.
I just haven't seen you like this in a while.  I'm used to seeing you more sedate.
Shouldn't we go to the cops?  I mean, I think we should tell the police.
Tell them what?!  What, Thelma? What do you think we should tell them?
We're gonna go to the next town and stop.  We'll get a motel room.  I can rest for a while and then figure out how to get some money.  We're gonna need money.  Thelma.  How much money do you have with you?
I called the asshole at 4:00 in the morning and he wasn't even home.  I don't know what he's got to be mad about.  I'm the one who should be mad.
Louise and Darryl don't get along.
So what are you gonna tell him?
Don't worry about it.  You want anything?
Drive!  Drive away!
You're disturbed.
Thelma.
Yeah.
I want you to call Darryl.
Oh, come on!  Murder one and armed robbery, Thelma!
But it wasn't!  We got away!  We were walkin' away!
Fill her up.  There's a phone right over there.
That J.D. kid is a little shit.
Louise?  Where are we?
Like a Chihuahua?
Gosh.  It sure is.
Harlan.
I'm warning you, Thelma.  You better drop it right now!  I don't want to talk about it!
I told you to slow down.  Hell, Officer, I told her to slow down.
I don't want to see any more beef jerky.  I mean the next beef jerky you hand me is going out the window. It's drivin' me crazy.  The whole car smells like it.
You do?
Shit.  I'm gettin' tired.
I think I've really fucked up.  I think I've got us in a situation where we could both get killed.  Why didn't we just go straight to the police.
I said all that?
Yes, Thelma?
You're not gonna give up on me, are ya?
Eeuww.
It's him.  He's got California plates.  It's the same guy.
Now what?
Then let's not get caught.
What are you talkin' about?
Are you going to apologize or not?
Yeah... sure did.
Hey, shit-for-brains, be careful not to scratch that thing, huh?
The thing's kind of heavy.
Look at me, Mary. On my mother's soul, on God above, on everything that is holy to me, I did not steal your shoes.
Good-looking?
It must be great with a wife like that.
Mary again.
I told you, her family moved to Miami.
I don't know about this, Dom.
The lazy fuck just didn't bother to look her up.
Remember our friend Healy? Well, I didn't know where to mail his last paycheck so I sent my assistant by his mother's apartment. Turns out there is no diabetic mom. Landlord said she's been dead for ten years.
Why's that?
The most honest moment in a man's life is the five minutes after he's blown a load. That's a medical fact. And it's because you're no longer trying to get laid. You're actually thinking like a girl. They love that.
Fucking Sully! Look at you!
Very nice.
Here, just have one of these then.
I'm gonna get a soda, you want one?
By the way, what's your name?
Don't you want to know my name?
They keep him confined? That's bullshit!
And it doesn't cramp your style?
All set.
Are you okay?
I don't know, maybe you could poke around for a half day and see if she has five kids and a Labrador.
You want her dead, don't you?
Sure she is. That's why she got an unlisted number and you haven't heard squat from her in a dozen years. Oh you're good, Ted. You're a real piece of work.
Look, let's forget it. Let's forget the whole thing.
I get one hundred a day plus expenses.
So she hasn't changed?
But you know, you shit out a bunch of kids, you're going to put on a few pounds.
So she's married?
It's just that... Mary. I wouldn't have thought...
All the same, I still want to call her. I know it sounds crazy -- Mary sure has a lot of troubles in her life -- but, I don't know, maybe I can help her out.  The poor thing's had it tough -- she's in a wheelchair for Godsakes.
It's a goddamn bunion. It'll heal.
Okay, tell you what: I'll get her number for you just as soon as she gets back from Japan.
You fucked me, man? Why would you do that?
Turn her over to a stalker.
What?! You're calling me a stalker?
I'm talking about the letter, asshole.
Boston, huh? Did you get your degree up there?
Really? But he's been married for twenty years -- they've got six kids.
Absolutely! I was there twice last year. Which building is yours?
Friend. Baseball bat.
What?
Oh that makes a lot of sense. Why would I rat myself out?
Jeez, I don't know where you're ever going to find a guy like that.
Bet your ass I have. It's an important job, Neighborhood Watch is.
Sure.  Uh, Magda, why don't you get some more cheese and crackers...?
Bundt cake?
Don't bet on it. Last time I had a pap smear the guy needed leather gloves and an oyster shucker.
Holy shit...
He's a nice guy, isn't he?
I think you'd better sit down.
I can't believe this is happening. I'm supposed to be meeting him in an hour.
Magda's right, I'm so lucky to have you in my life.
Oh he can hold you. He weighs two- hundred-and-thirty pounds.
Huh?
Oh my God... Ted.  What are you...? I can't believe this. I haven't seen you since --
Oh. So... what brings you down here?
I'm kidding. I'd really love to, Ted, but the thing is I already have plans. How about tomorrow night?
Nitrate-sicles -- I like that.
I say they should put more meats on a stick, you know? They got a lot of sweets on sticks -- popsicles, fudgesicles, lollipops -- but hardly any meat.
It's too bad you don't live down here, Ted.
Yeah?
Well good for you. I bet it works out for you.
Woogie and I went out for awhile in high school.
Yeah? What do you want?
You got what stuck?
Shirley, get in here! You gotta see this!
How the hell'd you get the beans all the way up top like that?
You're looking at him. C'mere and take a look at this beauty.
Teddy, hon, are you okay?  OH HEAVENS TO PETE!
So what's up?
See you, Warren.
I believe the President made it clear that there would be no firing on ships without his express permission.
Did you have any indication of this from Georgi? Any possible warning or sense of motivation?
He's right, Jack. Taylor is saying we may have some time. We've got to use it.
Lying bastard. Lied to my face.
The other thing is...
It's too politicized with you in there, anyway. They need to be able to stick their necks out.
Jack, I'm as conniving as they come, but a sneak attack is just wrong.
Hey, Mac. You're up bright and early.
Still heading for Cuba.
When are you going to be home?
Nothing. Nothing you don't know about. Tomorrow's the big day. Just have the car ready to go if I call or if the Civil Defense Warning comes on.
Why don't you ask him yourself? You can have him on the way home.
Dean Rusk!
Hey, sport. You winning?
It's a goddman trial balloon. Trial is the operative word, here.
You must think I'm blind and stupid. I've already gotten the birds and bees from Bobby. The President doesn't have to double-barrel me.
Just a second, Mr. President.
Mr. Clear Moon.
I know where I am. I'm on federal land, doing a federal investigation, and if you don't wanna cooperate you can take a ride in a federal car, and spend the rest of the day in a little room, answering federal questions. It's your call. Who are you?
South Dakota...  Did I do something unsatisfactory, Sir?
This is a restricted area.
I did.
Her oil pan is shot.
Today. And now you -- there's a dog in the van --
I'm not trying to pull against you, Cooch. I've just been having nightmares about the way Leo was killed.
Bastards...
It may have been Maggie's way of saying "get off my ass."
What are you --
Hey.  Hey, you, listen up --
I'm talkin' his spiritual mother. Maisy Blue Legs.
Why does he wanna see me?
Was-te. 'Cept for one thing. Jimmy Looks Twice was nowhere near there. Ya see, when Jimmy was twelve years old, his mother and father was killed in a car wreck right down there near Elk Mountain.
Walter. When I fill out my 302, do I say that evil spirits are killing everybody on the reservation?
Not no more.
You had a vision. You had yourself a vision. A man waits a long time for a vision. Might go his whole lifetime and never get one. And along comes some instant Indian with a Mastercard and brand-new shoes, has himself a vision.
Jimmy didn't kill Leo. Why do you wanna do this?
Yellow bird... is gonna sing.
Washington sent ya. I know that.
Get up out of the chair, Richard.
They sent me here, Richard because they said you didn't hold up your end of the arrangement, and I have to transport you back to Leavenworth.
What the fuck, man? What do you people want? I did what you wasi'cu's told me to do.
I took him out before he got the chance. He didn't say nothin' about Tashka Sha. And now his spirit is in the dirt. Forever.
What's Tashka Sha, speak English, speak English!
I'll bet!
Well, it is. It is that, too.
Not in this case. CHARLIE  You saw a MiG push negative 4G?
Is that all? CHARLIE What else do you want?
I thought there was something... That night in the club...
Used to what?
Let's make it at eight.
Anything.
You don't believe any of this. You don't think you'll ever die.
Food...and you...my F-14!
I was flying...my responsibility.
Hardly ever.
What kind of games?
That's three.
I didn't want to see you. I mean, I did...but I didn't..
And I'm gonna sneak off, and be by myself for awhile, like until I can think of a new career...hotel management or something...
Hey, I never said I was a fighter pilot...I never claimed to think it was fun to be shot off the end of a ship in a storm. I can find contentment in a good book. I don't have to roar by someone at Mach two with my hair on fire. Sometimes...I just get happy being with the right man.
Well?
Were upside down!
Can't you feel it? I'm hanging in my straps!
I'm pulling up.
It's crazy, man. Instruments are crazy. We're gonna have to eject.
Is there something I should know?
Just relax.
Is it the plane?
Is it you?
Then...shit! Go ahead. I'm right behind you.
On what?
Got you here.
What was that?
What do these guys think, I made Cougar quit?
Great move. Great
Hi...Hi there. How ya doing in there?  Mav... Ahhh...you know, at one point I did want a Navy career.
Come on, relax...
You see all those guys with gold on their shoulders!!?... Oh, no, I think that was Johnson, Air Boss of the Kitty Hawk!
GET LOST!
OKAY, GOING UP. ICE, GO HIGH.
You're a hell of a flyer.  You can be my wingman any time.
Nope.
Need a hint?
WALKED RIGHT INTO IT.
Three guesses.
Ah, the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat.
Ahhh... Runs in the family, sir.
I had him in view. I was peeling over the egg, into a dive. He saw me when I moved in for the kill. There wasn't any danger...
How do you feel?
I called your house.
I'm nothing like him.
They waved him off. He thought he knew better. He hit the ramp.
Where's yours?
I know a much better place down the block -- the girls are clean; the liquor ain't watered down...
Don't bother looking.  It's in your skull.
Get it, please.
The guy with the suitcase; the mask; the money; the message form Hauser...All of that was set up by us.
I know that.
So, been married long?
Sleazy...and demure.
Where's Kuato?
Hey Harry...Harry!  You ever heard of Rekall?
Yeah.
You went to Rekall, remember?
Where?
What was that?  I couldn't hear you.
How did I get in this taxi?!
...You mean it?
Sweetheart, we've been through this a million times.  You'd hate it on Mars. It's dry; it's ugly; it's boring!  --I mean, really, a revolution could break out there any minute.
Well...What do you say?
The hell you're not.
It was implanted by the Agency.
Nooo!  I would never do anything to hurt you.  I want you to come back to me.
I'm not interested in that.
What's he talking about?
I guess he didn't.
Because you're still working for Cohaagen.
Now what?
Like what?
He's lying.
This is the suitcase you gave me.
Okay, Burt, listen.  Forget shooting them.  Tell me this: can you get to your truck?
Yeah, like they got a plan...
Miguel, the trouble's come to us. If we're not ready...
Thanks.  God, I hope they're not screwed up.  I might have to bag the whole semester. Anyway, sorry to bother you.
Well, we can take my truck then.
You're really leaving, huh?
Burt and Heather's place is closer. Let's do their kitchen today.  Do Nestor tomorrow.
Fuck you!
You want the rifle or the Smith?
Here's the plan...We don't <u>even</u> stop.  Ride like hell.  Tonight we keep right on going.  We'll walk the horses.
That <u>is</u> the plan...I mean, goddamn it!  What the hell are those things?  How could they bury an entire Plymouth station wagon?
God, the live ones smell worse tan the dead ones.
You're right, don't matter where they come from.
Shut it up!  Shut the little bastard up!
Come on, you're not going to do your lasso thing...?
Road's in!  Now, soon as we hit Bixby we start making phone calls. We could make some real money off this whole thing, get in <u>People</u> magazine...
Civil?  I'm civil.
Well, I brung her something I know she likes.
The con...!  Oh my God.
Listen, they only respond to vibration, right?  Couldn't we... distract them somehow?
...Where're we goin'?
I don' need a hospital... I feel fine.
And the one on the right is the bullet you test-fired from Shu's gun?
Where's the nearest hospital?
I will allow the witness to testify. With the understanding that your questions are confined to the area of Mr. Kim's modus operandi.
I noticed.
Look, I'm a lawyer and --
Come now. Did you see the gun?
I can see the hammer still, it was cocked...
You're implying that I planted a gun?
Don't tell me where to work. I moved to New York to work for Edward Dowd. But I can't believe that Edward Dowd has nothing better to do these days than invoke exalted legal issues to get off guilty little --
So what're we gonna do?
But what?
I'm not that desperate.
A fucking wheelchair?
An Aryan Warrior with black teardrops painted on his face.
Afraid of what?
It was self-defense.
See-cil.
Oh come on, Cecil.
Are you willing to testify that the man you saw shoot Jimmy Chin was not the man the cops arrested?
It's in the area of narcotics, Mr. Reynard, that the government tramples on the Fourth Amendment.
You're pissing me off again, Ed.
Isn't it a fact that the "six other Asian men" in the line-up were all of the classic Mongoloid type, whereas Shu has the distinct facial bone structure of a Korean?
Your Honor, that's trial by ambush!
Your Honor, I know as much about these gangs as anyone; I'm well aware of the secrecy in which their machinations are cloaked... I assure you this witness offers the court a rare opportunity to place the defendant's crime --
-- Can't Mr. Dowd find his own expert witness, your Honor?
-- But you just said you were personally involved with all the principals of the investigation.
-- Every word.
I knew Jimmy Chin. The boy who was shot. Okay?
For control of the prison drug trade?
Do the rival gangs compete for control of the prison drug trade?
...A soldado, he takes care of it.
By "takes care of," you mean "kills".
Mr. Ortega, what is Shu Kai Kim's rank within La Compania?
Isn't it unusual for an Asian to be accepted into a Cuban prison gang?
You're a l-lawyer?  I... I haven't had my meds, or m-my vital signs t-taken yet. I...
She's in high school. She's sexually active. She's on drugs. She's crying out for some help.
Oh, yeah? You'll be callin' soon and maybe I'm not gonna be there.
Babe, I'm on my way out to the woods to divvy up the product. Put this cash in your safety deposit box...  It's ten thousand dollars.
What was?
Let's ditch this place and party.
I'm here to investigate the murder of Teresa Banks.
Maybe not a thing, but maybe two things.
A trailer was here. What the hell do you think?
Was there an argument?
Teresa Banks.
Agent Chet said he wanted to check the trailer court one more time. He had me drive the van with the body back here. Which we did. It was 105 miles.
The later events have never been kept a secret.
Any friends?
What happened to her?
Shorthand. Really?
Gordon said you were good. The tailored dress is our code for drugs. Did you notice what was pinned to it?
What? That's just Gordon's bad taste.
He talks loud. And he loves his code.
I see. He does talk loud.
Crushed skull. Probable cause repeated blows to the back of the head with an obtuse angled blunt object. Subject looks to be between 16 and 18 years of age.
She lived alone.
I couldn't help but notice that you had a suspicion that Deputy Cliff was the murderer. You did think that, didn't you, Agent Desmond?
Esthetics are subjective, aren't they, Agent Desmond?  I'm Sam Stanley. If you ever need me.
You didn't do your homework?
Do you think that if you were falling in space you would slow down after a while or go faster and faster?
Sure. What do you want me to call you?
Yes, that's what I want. Thanks D.
No.  I don't need to take this to be your friend.
Nice night.
My secret diary. There are pages missing.
A little trouble with your parents is the least of your worries and something I am certainly willing to put up with.
Buy me a ticket to The Great Went.
James...
Laura, I'll meet you at 2:30 after phys. ed.
No, it doesn't... just kiss me.
How can I be together if I'm not together?
This afternoon?
What do you mean?
What is wrong with us?... We have everything.
Johnny, Johnny... let your Daddy and your Uncle and Leland talk.  Ben... Leland, we can play the French against the Norwegians. What do the French love more than anything?
Hiking?
What are you afraid of? What people think?
Why wouldn't you eat a fish eye, Harry?
I understand.
Dad... Dad... Who was that? How do you know him? He looked familiar. Have I met him?
Leland, what are you doing?
Bobby didn't give you this?
That's one thing you are going to learn, Shelly, -- HOW TO CLEAN. It takes scrubbing, Shelly. There is no easy way. THIS IS WHERE WE LIVE, SHELLY.
As if I didn't know.
Laura just took off. She asked me to do the run today. Should I do it?
How good's your intelligence?
It's a generous offer, Mr. Galvin...  ...nothing can make the woman well... but we try to compensate... to make a gesture...
What is the truth?
What are you doing here?
...here's your mail, call Mrs. Doneghy...
To get somebody from a Boston hospital to say he'll testify?
This is going to drive the ante up.
How is that?
Through, through his book.
I am seventy-four years old.
Uh-huh. Still practice a lot of medicine?
Objection, we've...
Mr. Concannon...?
Nothing further, your Honor.
From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case...
Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes. In your opinion is his estimate correct?
I'm afraid that's not true.  Will you want me to stay on till Monday?
No. No thank you, Doctor. You go home.
'Code Blue'...
Dr. Towler; page 406, 'Contraindications to general anesthetic. Ideally a patient should refrain from taking nourishment up to nine hours prior to induction of general anesthetic.' Does that sound familiar?
I. Yes. It is.
Dr. Gruber...
The Archdiocese called, they want to settle... her estate...
...and you're going to do that?
I read the file. Yeah. Marx and Towler. I know who they were.
I understand.
You were the Admitting Nurse at St. Catherine Laboure Hospital on May twelfth, nineteen seventy-six, the night Deborah Ann Kaye was admitted...
One hour.
Yessir. I'm sorry.
Why is that?
What is it?
I could subpoena him if I had a week.
If I may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way...
Are you done?
D'you find an apartment?
Yes. It was, actually.
Maybe what?
We, we... No... we just had a small reversal in the case...  I have some, uh... I have some work to do...
You can't work if you can't think. You get in bed. It's all right. I'll stay here with you. It's all right. Come on...
You're going to stay here...?
Yes.
You want me to tell you it's your fault? It probably is. What are you going to do about it?  I thought it's not over till the jury comes in.
You, you don't under...
What is that to you...?
Is it over?
I have to reach him. This is an emergency. Could you give me his home number?
Pardon?
I told the guy I didn't want to talk to...
I've got nothing to say to you.
Then why don't you testify?
It's not a good case. It's a very good case.
...I know. I went...
You know how beautiful she was?  Her husband left her, and he took her kids... They, they, they'd let you die in there. They don't care. Nobody cares. The Patriot Home, the Chronic Care... in Arlington...? They'd take her in. Perpetual care. They'd take her. Fifty thousand dollars they want. An endowment.
He saw her at the Northern Care...
Are we going to win?  We have, you know, other tactics, though...
Dr. Halpern's taking all his...
...now who is that...?
...I have to stand up for her...
Forget it. You can't prove it. Sister's testimony is no good. Jury knows we win she gets the cash.
Brindisi versus Electric Boat.
Yeah? And what are you going to do tonight?
Yeah. I'm awake.
She's protecting the Doctors she'd be up there on the stand...
Hello. This is Mr. Dorchester in Records. We're looking for Kathy Costello...
I spoke to her, and everything is all right.
Dr. Towler...
...they start again three minutes earlier...
Brain damage could have been... it didn't necessarily take nine minutes, it could have been caused in two...
Wait, wait, wait, you're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes...?
Huh. And why is that?
Franky can't make it. He had an appointment he forgot, he's going to see you later. I'm Mickey Morrissey, we're supposed to get to know each other.
That Frank was working on. Yeah. He thought Franky needed some help, so they bribed a juror. So Franky finds out. He comes to me in tears. He thinks that anybody who knows what a 'spinnaker' is got to be a saint. I told him 'Franky, wake up. These people are sharks. What do you think they got so rich from? Doing good?' He can't be comforted. He tells the boys at Stearns and Harrington they've disappointed him, he's going to the Judge to rat them out.
That won't start no more fires.  We might's well go home.
It's no meteor, that's for sure!
How does it happen cars are running?
The troops are certainly moving in here!
But they seem to murder everything that moves...!
He liked you ... I could bawl my head off!
Nothing there now.
It might give us time to search out some weakness in the Martians.
That's their position?  You've certainly got them surrounded.  I suppose they've neutralized all communications here.
Not all.  Radio is out.  But our field phones are okay so far.
We will, sir!
They are living creatures out there.
They'll understand us, all right!
He's excited about the script.  You should be too.  It stars you.
Dylan, it's breakfast.  Not arts and crafts  What?
It was nothing.  We were both working on some movie, and a special effects thing went horribly wrong.  Terry and Chuck were...hurt.  You were almost...  You were even cut.
Like Freddy.
Any history of epilepsy in your family?
Diabetes?
Someone's coming.
He's on his way.
Dylan, where's the man?
Wes won't show it until it's finished. That's what he told me, at least.  I asked him at the funeral.
It's in my family, you know.  My grandmother died in an institution...
A man, or a boy with a deep, y'know, Freddy voice.
Listen, dammit.
I'll call the cops for you.  You've got the number on the fridge, right?
Dramatically speaking it makes perfect sense.  You played Nancy, after all, the first to humiliate and defeat him.
You may not like what you hear.
I haven't forgotten.
Oh I was walkin' down Lime street one day...
How old are you, son?
Okay, here's the duty.  Gieg, Weathers, Lapchick, Schucart: scrape and paint.  Corry and Stricklin have the brass.  Robinson, you're the Galley slave.  March you're on chain gang with Barnes. Johnston, solo on bilge detail.
Butler, what'd I ever do to you?
What do you mean?
When we were growing up I always felt like you would take care of things, that everything would be okay.  But you can't make this okay, can you?
Rick March.  Who the hell are you?
Gieg, Chuck.
What the "Bowsprit Affair"?
I walked in on my parents one time. It was only like eight o'clock and they were in bed and I thought that was kinda weird so I just walked in.
Bregitta.  Do you believe it?
You okay?
You know, I never had friends like this.
Hey, shut up will ya?
Do you have your ticket?
Ah... Northeast... sir.
I mean he has all these expectations and he doesn't even know who his own kid is.  What right did then have to show up here?
Chicken is a fool's game captain.
Why didn't you turn hard to port as the wind hit?
Albatross?  Doesn't inspire a lot of confidence.
Oh, really?
Listen to me, you thankless little prick.  We're your parents, so don't you dare talk to me disrespectfully. What the hell is it, this captain? Because I'll see him in a rowboat...
What?!  What's happening?!!
What's that?
Me, too.
Jesus!  What the hell happened to him.
Well, that was neighborly.
What's that?
You gotta be kidding?  He's a human chum line!
But, they don't speak English.
Swing up, son.
What?
I hate you, you son of a bitch!!!
No.
For killing a dolphin.
It wasn't hard.
If this young man had responded instantly to your command, do you believe the ship might have been spared?
Easy for you to say.
I'm fine, thank you. I had a cardiac infarction but I'm on a new diet and exercising regularly. I've never felt better.
This be it?
You used the toilet, now you can go - what I do around here ain't any of your business, that's for sure.
Need a hand?
Well... I mean like Lula bein' in a family way.
Have now.
That's right... Take one of these.
That's right... Could have a bad accident, though... before... durin'... or after a hold-up...
Hey!!!... Johnnie Farragut. How are you, my man.
Hell, that rings a bell. Someone told me somebody lookin' like her was at the Nothin' Fancy yesterday.
Sounds right... I'll check it out.
Mr. San Pedro Sula's authorized to carry a .45.
My name's George Kovich. Bet you've heard of me.
Are you going to provide me with an opportunity to prove my love to my girl? Or are you gonna save yourself some trouble and step up like a gentleman and apologize to her?
Don't fuck with me, man. You look like a clown in that stupid jacket.
Teddy Roosevelt, one of the local shrimp boat captains is in jail now. These people are friends of mine, so I must return and find out what happened.
I forgot to show you this. The gentlemen that gave this to me said you'd recognize it. Said he wanted it'd be 'bout the last thing you ever saw in this life.
Now, Marietta, I am goin' to help you. And don't be gettin' carried away. You don't want to be bringin' Santos and his people into it.
Darlin', you ain't seein' Santos again, are ya?
Really, Marietta, you got more scenarios swimmin' around in your brain than Carter got pills. Try to take it easy. Go over to Myrtle Beach for a few days.
I did, honey, but that was last night... Let's just find those two kids before it's too late.
That bastard Pucinski...
Don't give me no trouble now, Pace, please. This ain't the easiest day in a long time. And what do you mean how are we gonna know what your daddy looks like? You seen his photo.
Grandmama said how Sailor murdered a man.
Did you ever think somethin' like about the wicked witch of the east comin' flyin' in?... Did you ever think somethin' and then later think you've said it out loud to someone?
Camels, same as me... Guess both my mama and my daddy died of smoke or alcohol related illness.
You remind me of my daddy, you know? Mama told me he liked skinny women whose breasts were just a bit too big for their bodies. He had a long nose, too, like theirs. Did I ever tell you how he died?
But honey, I thought you told me your Uncle Pooch raped you when you was thirteen.
You okay, honey?
Oh, nothin'. I never let on to mama about Dell bein' the one. I just flat refused to tell her who the daddy was? I didn't tell Dell, neither. He was back home in Chattanooga by then, anyhow, and I didn't see the point. Somethin' terrible happened to him, though. Six months ago.
Sorry, baby... When's the first time you done it with a girl who wasn't hookin'?
You're excitin' me, honey. What'd she do?
Poor baby. She don't know what she missed. What color hair she have?
I suppose so. She knew I was bound to see you soon as you was sprung, but I don't figure she counted on us takin' off together like this... I guess this means you're breakin' parole, then?
It ain't. It's part of the lessons of life. I picked me up a pack of Vantages before we left the Cape?
Manslaughterer, honey, not murderer. Don't exaggerate.
M-i-ss-i-ss-i-pp-i... You can almost hear that jazz blowin' up from the big N.O.
Too bad they don't give an award for talkin'... You'd win first prize. Especially with those tits.
You don't feel you was a little hard on the guy, honey?
You ready for this?
Well, she ain't talked to nobody and ain't nobody spoke to her that I could tell. What you make of that?
It's me who's wastin' time, Sailor, bein' with you.
Yes I did... I sure did... The bad side of it is I did some drivin' for a man named Marcello Santos...
We all got a secret side, baby. Hope you don't think I been lyin' to you 'bout other things, sugar.
Yeah, I'm here.
It's a comfortin' idea.
Oh God, Sailor.
Anything I can do for you?
It's okay by me, peanut.
And Bobby too, I hear...
You talk to 'im some?...
You in a dance hall or somethin'? I can hear music behind you.
Argentina! Lula, you're outta your mind. Now you just tell me where you are and I'll come for you. I won't say nothin' to the police about Sailor, I promise. He can do what he wants, I don't care.
Santos... It isn't.
Yes.
That's your business... I don't care how.
Where? In the leg?
Yes.
Yes.
What?...
So?
I'll tell you the problem. You behind the wheel. There's your fucking problem.
He's great. Come on, let's blow before lo' Gran decides to boil your bones for breakfast.
You snore.
Do you know how many times I've boarded an airplane praying someone like her would sit down beside me? Particularly while I'm on my way to Pittsburgh.
You didn't actually purchase this car, did you. Trip??
Left you...? Who? Emily?
He's a boxer. A flyweight.
Huh uh. A jockey. His name's, um, Curtis... Curtis Hardapple.
Wait here. I'll be right back.
You stay there.
His parents.
Is it a little late to call the Chancellor?
I've been doing this a long time, Tripp. I feel this kid in my bones.
It's just ail that crap he spins out. Just once I'd like to know if the little bastard is telling the truth.
I'm afraid he's pretty worn out, poor kid.
Who do you think it is?
First I see if Hannah will let me borrow her car.
Let me get this straight. Jerry Nathan owes you money. So, as collateral, he gives you his car.
'That's my car, motherfucker.'
...we find the jacket.
There's only one problem, Tripp. We don't know his real name. We just made it up. In fact, we made the whole guy up.
Oh, Professor Tripp? You know, last semester, what I said that time in office hours -- I hope there's no hard feelings.
You need to see a doctor, Mr. Tripp. An internist. And I think you really ought to consider seeing a therapist, as well.
So is my friend... is Sara still here?
Boy or girl?
Hello?
Yea?
It was my mother's. She won it in a penny arcade in Baltimore when she was in Catholic school.
She went crazy, Frances Farmer.
It's colder in there.
Go ahead.
Maybe. I'm feeling a little sad myself tonight.
Does she want to hear it was one of her professors?
That's a big trunk. It fits a tuba, a suitcase, a dead dog, and a garment bag almost perfectly.
Miss Sloviak's.
I put you on the floor.
Jesus, James, you should've told someone.
Glaucoma?
Carvel.
Seitz Plastics. That's where he met my mom. She was a fry cook in the cafeteria. Before that, she'd been a dancer.
I'm telling you what I was told by my uncle. And he should know. He ran half a dozen men's clubs in Baltimore before he skipped town on a bad debt.
When we fall, we fall hard.
I thought you were the guy who didn't like to lose control of his emotions.
I just wanted a little sip.
You just worry about yourself, James. Okay?
That's why she hates me. That's why she makes me sleep in the basement.
I'm not worried. You're not worried, are you. Professor Tripp?
I think so... What about you?
He shot the Chancellor's dog, didn't he? The blind one.
Crabtree? He doesn't even know James.
He cribbed that from Borges.
It's just that, you know, I was thinking about how, in class, you're always telling us 'that writers make choices -- at least the good ones. And, don't get me wrong. I'm not saying the book isn't really great -- I mean, really great -- but at times it's, well, very detailed, you know, with the genealogies of everyone's horses and all the dental records and so on -- and I don't know, maybe I'm wrong, but it sort of reads, in places, like, well, actually, like...  ...you didn't make any choices at all. And I was wondering if it might not be different if, maybe, when you wrote, you weren't always... under the influence.
That's funny. I need to talk to you, too.  Perhaps you could put some of these coats in the upstairs guest room, Professor Tripp.
Well. This is... surprising. Does Walter...?
She's left before...
Yes.
And? Are you going to tell him?
Well...
You got me.
I believe you. I believe you want to be with me. But this is not just about me anymore.
About the baby.
I think I might have.
And what did you say?
I'm so glad to see you, Sara.
I went and looked at some babies just now.
He's writing his name in water.
I have... eight-fifteen. That's not right, is it?
Excuse me?
Yo, Traxler.
Do you get high, Sam?
Holy shit. Are you serious?
She's in Philadelphia seeing Linda Aahby. The neurologist.
A jockey? You mean, like --
That's weird.
We figure the perpetrator let him out. He's blind and we figure he just wandered off and got run over.
I might have his number on campus.
Foreman now.
I'll never forget you got me started there.
Hey, is that a school?
You're the only one in the family who still talks to me.
Fucking Mariners.
You should see my appointment book. It got crazy.
There's a million birds here.
Is that right?
It's hard to describe.
I think you do.
No.
Sure you do. He cuts open the wolf's stomach, and the girl steps out alive.
I was asleep.
Yes.
You sure you don't know nothing about this?
Sergeant Lucas.  May I come in?
The new man. I'd keep away from him, if I were you.
Birds are my friends. That sounds egotistical, but they are. Birds know I watch them, but they don't mind because they like being watched... if they know you won't hurt them.
Yes?
No thank you.
I'm not running for Mr. Popularity.
Walter, I'd like you to try something for me.
I'd like you to keep a journal.
That's right.
Ev-i-dence.
Good. That's an honest answer. And why don't you like coming here?
Is it just my cheery personality that makes your skin itch?
How do you feel about that?
Have you talked to Carlos about your concerns?
Is that what you are angry about?
How long is this going to take?
We have a lot of work to do.
I want to be normal!
I know --
If by "problem" you mean your desire for prepubescent girls, yes.
That's not a helpful answer.
Close your eyes and let your mind be blank.
In my bedroom, sleeping.
Where?
All right.
That's all. I just liked smelling her hair.
It's going to take time, Walter.
Are you okay?
Want a ride?
I'm talking about you.
Me?
Southern light.
Your windows face south. Northern light is the purest. But southern light is very good.
I like the noise.
So... what's your dark secret?
Of course. Sorry. I'm such a fucking asshole.
I suffer from insomnia.
You should be shocked. Or do you get off on this shit?
You mean the time you're locked away?
No. That's what I used to tell myself.
Well, most people are stupid.  You want to talk about odds? One day I'll tell you how I survived as the youngest in a family of three sons. You wanna talk about odds?
It's a bad idea.
I've got problems.
You okay?
I heard they were filthy birds.
Doesn't mean you had to marry her.
Bud!  Hippy's on the bitch-box.  It's a call from topside.  That new company man.
What's goin' on, Boss?
Lord Almighty.
Hi, Lins.  I thought you were in Houston.
You wimp.  I had a lot riding on this.  They bought you... more like least rented you cheap--
You wanna know what I think?
But you think it's something else.  What?  One of ours?
No.
Come on, you guys... look, this is the little one right here.  You can see how it's kind of zigging around.
If you say so.  It could be anything.
You totaled it, huh?
Try again.
Son of a bitch!
I know!  I know!  But we better come up with something.
Look, it's three AM.  These guys are running on bad coffee and four hours sleep.  You better start cutting them some slack.
Is that it?  Is this right?
Cat, you tie onto this manifold.  There's some tanks on the other side; I'm gonna go check them out.
Y'all could be more specific.
Fluid breathing system.  We just got them.  We use it if we need to go really deep.
Hey!
Getting a reading?
4800 feet.  It's official.
8500 feet, Bud.  Everything okay?
But where are you going?
I'm thirsty.
Yes, fairly well. But I went to bed last night planning to do some thinking about a number of things ... instead, I fell asleep.
To the fact of my retirement, not only as a diplomat but also as a father.
Well, what?
Maybe you'd better ask him.
Shall we go for a swim?
Twelve years ... But why haven't they married?
Yes, very much so.
Yes.
Yes, you should go.
No, I'm sure it won't. Move over there. Let's make believe nothing happened. And when we get to the next station, get off.
Are you joking?
Claudia, let's get married?
Sandro ...What's the matter?
Sandro, I'm not coming down.
I love you.
Do you know why? Because if you saw those ruins I'm sure you would have said they were very, very beautiful. You always say "how beautiful" to everything -- whether it's the sea, or a baby, or a cat! You have such a sensitive little heart that it throbs for anything.
How did you spend the night?... In that hut?... And what did you have to eat?
First let the poor thing have something to eat.
Ettore...
Nothing, nothing  at all. I was just looking for Sandro.
Where is she going?
The trouble with you is that nobody can speak to you, that's all.
It's strange how anxious women are to display themselves. It's almost a natural inclination.
Now look, my men saw it and they also saw you men throwing those crates overboard. What have you got to say about that?
Yes, she takes care of the garden.
And why wouldn't we have one like this?
Look, Marshal, with those deep crevasses, you'll need some rope and ladders...
Whose boat is that?
At this time of the year there are so many boats...
What do you want us to do? I don't know myself... But we'll do something.
Ettore must be fed up with me by now.
You're kidding!
Agnes...
No he doesn't. He hates fat people.
Look at the statues, they're thin.
Oh my dear child.
Of God.
I'm being punished.
Why?
I don't know.
Sister Marguerite says you have been sleeping on a bare mattress Sister. Is that true?
How many times have I burned into your thick skull and the thick skull of your fellow novice, that menstruation is a perfectly natural process and nothing to be ashamed of.
It's not my time of month.
I don't know... I don't know...
You have a lovely voice.
Hasn't anyone ever told you that before?
What would you like to talk about.
I don't know.
Everyone.
Right now?
Agnes, have you ever loved another man... other than, Jesus Christ?
Yes.
Well do you love... do you love Father Martineau?
No. But... when I look into his eyes, I can tell.
At least once a week.
I... I don't understand.
Then let's talk about something else...
Why not?
What else did she tell you?
Sister Paul was in her eighties?  Did she climb up here often?
Like what?
Numbers... you can spend your whole life counting and never reach the end.
No. There is nothing else. Just being here at night helps me sleep.
She knew what was going to happen to me. That's why she hid me away.
No, but I can never tell her that.
Why not?  Mmm?
I could never be a mother.
Why not?
How would that person get one if they didn't want one?
But you're troubled... aren't you?
She can't hurt you any more.
... take off my clothes and then... she makes fun of me.
And that you're stupid?
Because she says if I don't watch out I'll have a baby.
Doctor Livingston.
How did you have a baby?
Yes.
Yes.
Did anyone else know about the baby?
And then what happened?
Someone's following me.
Of me. Oh... God!  My God...  Water... it's all water...
Why isn't anyone coming?
Who?
Yes.
I've been watching. We were fine 'till she came. She brought the devil here.  There was blood on her hand that night.
Eve, she strangled a baby!
Why?
All I want is one more week.
You're getting to all of us Martha, let's face it.
Oh Joe... Joe she didn't kill the baby.
But what you believe makes no difference to us whatsoever Doctor. But it does make all the difference to Agnes.
How did she hide it from the other nuns?
Look doctor, I don't know how to tell you this politely, but I don't approve of you. Not you personally...
From other people!  I believe she is not crazy, nor is she lying.
And in your eyes?
It's possible isn't it?
Oh come on, you've talked to her. She doesn't even know how babies are born, let alone made.
Oh, some time in January.
Nothing.
What sheets?
You just said...
I wasn't. I wasn't. She was the pretty one. She died, why not me?  I never said my morning prayers. And I was ugly, I was scrawny, I had buck teeth and freckles all over my face, do you know what the nun called me, Sister Mary Clitus, called me Polkadot Livingston.
My sister died in a convent. And it's her voice I hear.  Does my smoking bother you?
Right...
Mary Magdelen?
Well you can try, can't you, to be good?
Don't be ridiculous.
This is insane.
But what you are choosing to believe is a lie because you won't face the fact that she was raped... or seduced... or that she did the seducing.
Why would I lie?
Who was that person Mother?  Was it you?
You wanted that child out of the way.
That's a lie.
And the baby.
Oh, don't do this!
Eh?
I bet you're  -- sixteen!
Y'what?
Are you now?
Yeah? And they're your mates are they?
Why aren't you at work?
I'm a deserter, too.
You don't think...
Well, that's the wrong line for a start.
Ever seen one of these before?
You've got an inferiority complex, you have.
I'm afraid I don't understand.
Only Susan Campey, our resident teenager. You'll have to love her. She's your symbol.
A butcher?
Oh, listen to teacher's pet.
Eh, I don't know if you realise it, but ...
We do.
You haven't, you're just late.  Oh, yes, he's going to be very pleased with you.
Should I say it?
It's Paul's grandfather.
Is it ... is it, really?
Yeah ... I mean, sure, well, I took it at school but I only ever heard boys and masters saying those lines, like, sounds different on a girl.  Yeah, it's gear on a girl.
Oh, I see. You are an actress though, aren't you?
Oh, I don't know, anyroad up, they never are, are they?
... all this and a jam butty too!!
No, hang on, I've not gone daft. You see, when I was little me mother let me make some treacle toffee one time in our back scullery. When I'd done she said to me, "Go and give some to the other kids." So, I said I would but I thought to meself, "She must think I'm soft." Anyroad, I was eating away there but I wanted somebody else to know how good it was so in the end I wound up giving it all away ... but I didn't mind, mind, 'cos I'd made the stuff in the first place. Well ... that's why you need other people... an audience ... to taste your treacle toffee, like. Eh ... does that sound as thickheaded to you as it does to me?
Well ... what's the matter with that?
And what's it all come to in the end?
Well I'm not exactly a voluntary patient.
What?
Me!
You ugly, great brute you, you have sadism stamped all over your bloated British kisser.
Oh, it's all right for you but those two girls were scared to death! Honest, Grandad, why? I mean, why do you do these things?
Yeah ... so what?
She's going to show me her stamp collection.
Don't move, any of you. They've gone potty out there. The whole place is surging with girls.
You wouldn't!
What?
No, not me.
Oh do I? You're the first one who ever said that.
He's betrayed the class.
Have <U>you</U> lost him?
Eh, where's my grandfather?
It's not my fault.
Who?
Oh, I didn't notice, where'd he go?
Nerves.
Eh, what's all this?
Oh, a little savage, is he?
So you just brought the old chap out of the crowd for his own good.
Is that you, Roby?
... I don't know...
Approaching point of origin.  Closing at 20 kilometers, 15 and slowing. Ten.  Five.  Gentlemen, we are directly above the source of the transmission.
What's the terrain down there?
Well, line of sight is impossible due to dust.  Radar gives me noise. Sonar gives me noise.  Infrared -- noise.  Let's try ultraviolet.  There. Flat.  It's totally flat.  A plain.
Is it solid?
Don't you remember?
Hell, you're in great shape, you've got your sense of humor back!
What's wrong?
Computer, this is Captain Standard. What conditions are you talking about?
I have intercepted a transmission of unknown origin.
A transmission?
Just a minute, hold it, I'm checking.
How long to fix?
The computer's translated the alien signal, and it's kind of alarming.
It grows on you.
What the hell's going on?
Oh -- I'm not near ready yet.
Hey, guess what?
There.  Should be coming through about there.
I'll do it.  The rest of you continue.
You know, it's fantastic -- the human race has gone this long without ever encountering another advanced life form, and now we run into a veritable zoo.
Well, what the hell good can we do in here?  We can't grab it -- it might jump on us --
He's running a fever.
Well... now we have to herd that thing up here.
Now what's wrong?
Can you get them back?
Why, you chickenshit bastard --
What about all the minerals and elements in the cargo hold?  That's the only reason we came out here. We'd have to abandon them all.  We'd be broke.
But what can we do?  He's out of radio contact.
We're just plain lucky.  That could have gone right through the hull -- taken <u>weeks</u> to patch it.
We're going home.  We're in hyperspace.
I thought I'd find you here.
We're the new pioneers, Chaz.  We even have our own special diseases.
It's out of focus.
Good!  Moisture content?
Martin, uh, we've found it.
Here, Chaz.
We're coming up now, open the outer lock door.
Look, I'm not trying to rub anybody's nose in anything.  The important thing is just to get away from here as fast as possible.
Once we kill the thing we won't need the food any more -- we can go straight into hypersleep.  Also, it sounds like that thing is already doing a pretty good job on our supplies; it may be fouling them all.
This stuff's deadly -- I hope we know what we're doing.
Now what?
So the only question left is: who gets to crawl down the airshaft?
That's a flip-flop gate to channel the air, but we can use it to trap the thing.
Yeah... I forgot.
So what do we do?  Do we ignore it and finish loading the explosives into the boat -- or do we flush it out now?
Good argument for gun-control.  What are you going after, rhino?
We've got no option.  We're gonna have to get it off.
When?
One more sweep... one more sweep.  I'm getting tired of one more fuckin' sweep. We're been lookin' for this thing for three days now, and found zip.
Goldsmith's gonna be plenty pissed at losing one of her babies.
What?  Are you nuts?  Just the two of us?
Alright, okay.  Look...
Is it still moving?
That sounds promising.  Can we operate the crane from here?
We had to.  They were just too cumbersome for some of the conduits you're gonna have to negotiate.  Besides, all the crap floating around reduces visibility to the extent where I doubt having helmet lights would have make that much difference, anyway.  Maintenance lights down there oughta be enough to do the trick.
And...?
Everything on this module is locked and sealed.  We've lost 'B', 'C', and 'E' wings, but 'E' was the only one we didn't manage to totally evacuate.
Let's just run through it one more time so I know you've got it straight.
How long you been out here for now, anyway?  Three months?
Four.
Only six?
Nothing.  With the satellite down, we can't transmit over the mountain range. He's most likely sitting there wondering why he can't raise us.
'We'?  You wanna fly out there with me?
Cornering it shouldn't be a problem.  Each part of this station is basically a self-sufficient deep-space transport module running off external couplers.  If we disconnect them and seal off every section, we've got a ceiling of about thirty-six hours on internal power.  That should give us ample time to find it.
Hurry it up.
It's not modesty. I just don't try to kid myself.
I don't think I've done anything to sound off about.
I'd love to! Or should I pretend I'm busy?
San Francisco. An oasis of civilization in the California desert. Tell me, do you share my high opinion of San Francisco?
Heart to heart? Woman to woman? Including a casual reference to the part of "Cora" - and your hopes of playing it.
Are you that sure of tomorrow?
You know me better than that.
Lloyd Richards is commercially the most successful playwright in America-
We decided the night before last, before we came up here...
It is possible - even conceivable - that you've confused me with that gang of backward children you've been playing tricks on - that you have the same contempt for me that you have for them?
Everything. Because after tonight, you will belong to me.
A dull cliche.
Claudia dear, come closer.  This is Max Fabian. He is a producer. Go do yourself some good.
She was magnificent.
It could only have been your natural timidity that kept you from mentioning it...
We have that in common.
The ladies' - shall we say - lounge?
Eve! My understudy...
Eve was incredibly modest. She insisted that no credit was due her, that Lloyd felt as he did only because she read lines exactly as he had written them.
Bill!
Huh?
Right here. A minute ago.
How childish are you going to get before you quit it?
I don't want to be childish, I'd settle for just a few years-
What a thoughtful, ever-lovin' thing to do-
Bill? Have I gone crazy, Bill?
Happy little housewife...
Now how can you take offense at a kid trying in every way to be as much like her ideal as possible!
Mad! Darling, there are certain characteristics for which you are famous - on stage and off. I love you for some of them - and in spite of others. I haven't let those become too important to me. They're part of your equipment for getting along in what is laughably called out environment - you've got to keep your teeth sharp. All right. But you will not sharpen them on me - or on Eve...
Addison-!
Poor little flower. Just dropped her petals and folded her tent...
The gong rang. The fight's over. Calm down.
You're being terribly tolerant, aren't you?
I am sick and tired of these paranoiac outbursts!
No, I'll tell it to you! For the last time, I'll tell it to you. Because you've got to stop hurting yourself, and me, and the two of us by these paranoiac tantrums!
I've been aware of that for some time.
Then what would be enough?  If we were married?
It's only for the license. There's a three-day wait - blood tests, things like that...
You said forty-seven minutes. You'll never make it.
I just wondered.
Why what?
I don't have to. I want to.
Eighty percent of it will go for taxes.
So few come back...
Your make-up's a little heavy.
- and for you.
You're quite a girl.
What did you expect - live sables?
I'm sure you must have things to do in the bathroom, Birdie dear.
Kill the people.  Got your key?
When we get home you're going to get into one of those girdles and act for two and half hours.
If I may so bold as to say something - did you ever hear the word "union"?
Why not?
Now you want an argument.
The only thing I ordered by mistake is the guests.  They're domestic, too, and they don't care what they drink as long as it burns... where's Bill? He's late.
I ain't dense. And he's been here twenty minutes.
Please don't have me arrested, please! I didn't steal anything - you can search me!
I might.
Why should you think I wouldn't be?
If I only knew how...
- and easy or not, I won't believe a word.
Do you expect me to believe that you didn't say any of those things - that they were all Addison?
- an understudy's performance.
A part in a play. You'd do all that - just for a part in a play.
Not at all...
There's the script to go back to the Guild-
Right here.
Yes, dear. You forgot all about it.
If you'd like.
That little place just two hours form New York. It's on my list of things-I'll-never-understand. Like collecting shrunken Indian heads...
None in sight, there aren't many along this back road...
So many people - know me. I wish I did. I wish someone would tell be about me...
Margo. Bill is all of eight years younger than you.
Not to you. Not to Bill.
In this rat race, everybody's guilty till they're proved innocent! One of the differences between the Theater and civilization...  ... what gets me is how all of those papers in town happened to catch that particular performance!
The critics thought so, the audiences certainly think so - packed houses, tickets for months in advance - I can't see that either of Lloyd's last two plays have hurt you any!
Up to here! That's where I've got it - up to here! Of all the star ridden, presumptuous, hysterical-
I just don't want Margo to miss her train. As it is, she'll barely make the theater...
Where'd you get all that information?
Eve?
She's been to see me, as a matter of fact she left just before you came in - you just missed her...
That was a pity...
I'm beginning to catch up.
Margo - and Bill - want us to meet them at the Cub Room tonight, after theater. For a bottle of wine.
Margo in the Cub Room. I couldn't be more surprised if she'd said Grant's Tomb.
Darling, I didn't promise Eve anything. Just said I thought she'd be fine for the part, but there were some practical difficulties...
You disapprove of me when I'm like this, don't you?
Not exactly. Sometimes, though, I wish I understood you better.
The play? All right, I guess...
Spoken like an author.  Lloyd, I'm not twentyish. I am not thirtyish. Three months ago, I was forty years old. Forty. Four oh.  That slipped out, I hadn't quite made up my mind to admit it. Now I feel as if I'd suddenly taken all my clothes off...
Eve? Eve, my understudy? But I had no idea...
Karen and I just don't want an accident-
Call, what call?
We are ready with the call you placed for 12 midnight, California time, to Mr. William Sampson in Beverly Hills...
"Liebestraum."
You get quick action, don't you?
I don't know if this would be a wise move...
Who am I to threaten? I'm a dying man.
--I sure couldn't hurt it, could I?--
Carl?
Forget it, the main thing--  --did you call me a failure?
Maybe a political operative of some sort--
You think they are confidential? I don't know anything about how this town works, I haven't lived here a year yet.
--she was panicked, Carl--every time I mentioned Watergate, you could tell.
Were you eyebrow reading?
You're not a kid anymore.
I hate both parties.
Republican?
Did he just say what I think he said?
--we've got to find out who the five guys are--the five with access to the slush fund--they were aware of the break-in.
--I know a lawyer at Justice--
--I haven't said anything--
Segretti criss-crossed the country over ten times in six months--and never stayed anyplace over a night or two.  Switch to another station, huh? You're driving me crazy with that.
--according to sources involved in the Watergate investigation. Beginning in the spring of 1971--
Listen, I've got a dinner--can't we do this tomorrow?
You want Barker's phone stuff or his money stuff?
Sorry.  Now if it was Hunt you were interested in--
--Teddy Kennedy?
Sometimes it got up to a quarter maybe--  --off the record.
But you know who did.
Chapin did contact you then?
It gets interesting if it was Haldeman, because our word is that when Chapin says something, he's gotten the OK from Haldeman, and when Haldeman says something, he's gotten the OK from the President.
Speak.
I thought you guys were supposed to be working on this story--  --you think I like being aced out?
--it would have been nice to have had this, I sure would have liked to have had this--
--if he did it or just said he did it, God knows.
You've really got to go.
I can't be positive that it was used for the break-in but people sure are worried.
Which people?
Gordon Liddy, you mean?
So tell me about the Times article.
But they both worked at the White House?
What's this?
Go on.
This is a daily paper, we'll explain it tomorrow.  You're certain on Mitchell?
I got Clawsen on hold--
--I'm sure--
Anything else from Mr. Throat?
What I don't understand is how you got here.
Barker's wife called me at three this morning; her husband apparently had told her to call if he hadn't called her by then.
It was really nice of you to come, since you'd only met him once.
Yes, sir.
Fifty ratfuckers directed by the White House to destroy the Democrats?
--you've done worse than let Haldeman slip away, you've got people feeling sorry for him--I didn't think that was possible. A conspiracy like this-- the rope has to tighten slowly around everyone's neck. You build from the outer edges and you go step by step. If you shoot too high and miss, then everybody feels more secure. You've put the investigation back months.
...Central... Intelligence... Agency...
I think so.
--absolutely--and that's all they do, sit sit sit--every once in a while, they call up a Senator, some reporting--
You call me in on my day off because some idiots have broken into local Democratic Headquarters--tell me, Harry, why should I be smiling?
Who's Colson, Harry?
--who you got?--
Maybe to fire you--since you two started on this story, the Post stock has dropped, what, 50 percent?  And the word is some Nixon people are challenging her TV licenses. I'm not saying she's going on relief, but I don't think it's unreasonable for her to want to meet you.
--well and good, but when will he say it on the record.
Go on.
--I already get the Post. I don't need another subscription.
You work there, Miss Abbott.
I'll do it.
Good work, Ostreicher.
You have to pay attention to a girl. Be sensitive to her feelings. Relationships are reciprocal.
Perhaps you should consider actually answering an ad.
I'm three sheets to the wind, ma'am!
What are we gonna hear?
You know, Jim...you could go back there...and...
Yeah...so...you've got this sort of... Bobby McFerrin thing going there.
Do I have to?
I saw you making fun of me with your lacrosse buddies.
I wasn't making fun of you.
Hi...
That's nice.
You called me Oz.
What the hell are you expecting him to drive to Vanderbilt for?  Milk and cookies?
Vicky, it's not a space shuttle launch, it's sex.  So did you do the physics write-up?
Of course he does.  What about you? Have you just never had one with Kevin -- or have you never had one, period?
I think I've had one.
Of course.
I -- I don't know, you can't ask me that.
Well, if you want to get her in the sack, tell her you love her.  That's how I was duped.
There's our man.
Gotta go.
Yeah, it's like tradition or something.
I have no idea.  Finch showers in a bathing suit.
Holy shit.
Jim?
You know, at band camp?  We have dances like this.  Only they're way funner.  Don't you think prom is just highly overrated?
Are they gross or something, like guy stuff?  Tell me.
That is a <u>nasty</u> story!
Okay...that would be cool sometime.  How 'bout tomorrow?
Well...uh...
Did you see this?  This is your more exotic dirty magazine.
Yes...James, it is knowing that these beautiful women arouse you that arouses me...
Kevin!  You seen Shitbreak lately?
Oh no, Stifler, what did you do?
It's a big, thick envelope, Vicky. You got in.
Vicky -- do you think, maybe...it's time for us to take the next step in our relationship?
Let me know.
And I want to try to make it up to you.
Did you know that it's...450 miles from Ann Arbor to Nashville?
See -- this is the nicest room.
Yeah.  Are you sure?
What?
Yeah, but we'll still see each other.
Hah!  Yeah, Oz, I bet it's more like your dad works at <u>her</u> store.
Come on, you know the words, sing along.
I mean, if by some miracle you can find the werewolf that bit you, and then manage to eat it's heart, the curse is lifted. I was gonna tell you but Marcel wouldn't let me.
Either way works for us...
A-duh... You're a werewolf. And we, as your victims, have to walk the earth until your curse is lifted.
Fine. My mistake. You know, I'm gonna be a writer myself some day.
Andy! Holy shit!
What about your glasses?
Don't you want to change?
So's Woody Allen.  No, your uncle really helped me. I was sort of messed up for a while. Wasting my time just partying and... just stupid shit. He kind of woke me up, gave me a job, got me taking classes.  You know, he and Claude, their work is controversial, but they're serious about it. Totally dedicated.
I don't... I... I can't remember...
Andy... I should never have let you go underground. I'm sorry...
What makes you so sure this will work?
What?
Oh God. Shit...
Where's the ADM? Where did your uncle put it?
So, if you and the nutty professor are both werewolves, what do you want with drugs? You like seeing lots of pretty colors when you're tearing people's throats out?
I'm sorry my friend, I'm not signing books right now. There's been a tragedy.
Yeah, well, why did he hang out here? The cops said it's dangerous -
It killed him... You coulda just used Draino. It's cheaper.
Andy? Andy is that you?
How well did, er, do you know him?
Fuck you! If I'm gonna kill myself I'll do it when I'm good and ready! You can go to hell!
Don't worry. In a few seconds you won't feel a thing.
Oh, Grandmama, why do you have to go back to Paris?
Did I tell you that?
No! I look ridiculous!
Yes, your highness.
Ouch!  That really hurt!
I don't know - I don't remember anything that happened before the revolution. . .
You know, it's strange - Anastasia's grandmother, the Dowager Empress Tatiana has been looking for Anastasia since the revolution.  Why do you think she wouldn't go to her own grandmother?
Do you always punch people first thing in the morning?
It's the best fork of all
You said you wouldn't laugh!
Yeah ... well, yours. You still don't believe that you're the Princess, do you?
Well, the only thing you've got when you've got a home is a fear of losing it! You're lucky you don't remember the revolution -- I never had much, but what I did have -- I lost.
PAR AWAY, LONG AGO GLOWING DEEP AS AN EMBER
This is who you were. Exactly who you are is up to you.
Do you have any idea what would happen if that broke?!
Yesss... our power is much stronger when were near. We must get close to her.
Boy, don't you hate it when that happens?
What do we do now?
Life is funny, isn't it. You find the right girl ... and then you lose her.
I'll show you!
I need to speak with the Dowager Empress ...
Rasputin!  You're alive . . .
Despite being shot, poisoned and thrown into an icy river . . . YES!
Oh, heavens - I must say, yes.
Oh, heavens I must say... no, no actually, I can't - Tatiana has refused to see any more girls.
Hey, you on television?
Fellas... you know-Jesus! Come on!
I took a meeting with Freddy. Freddy took a meeting with Charlie. You take a meeting with him.
It's okay.
It-but it-it... doesn't make any sense. He drove past the book depository and the police said conclusively that it was an exit wound. So-how is it possible for Oswald to have fired from two angles at once? It doesn't make sense.
Bad mood? I'm standing with the cast of "The Godfather."
You're gonna hafta learn to deal with it.
Okay.  Please, I have a headache, all right?
Hey, you are in a bad mood. You-you- you must be getting your period.
In the middle?  We'll only miss the titles. They're in Swedish.
I'm-I'm-I'm gonna have a stroke.
Stop it, Alvy!
Alvy, I...
Oh, come on-I mean, I was still younger.
Oh - you're an actress.
Right!  Where?
For yuh.
No, no, that'll be fine. I don't mind. Sure.
You sure?
Y-y-yeah, just for fifteen years.
Sylvia Plath.
Uh, I hate to tell yuh, this is nineteen seventy-five, you know that "neat" went out, I would say, at the turn of the century.  Who-who are-who are those photos on the wall?
Yeah, it's a great story, though, I mean, I... I... it really made my day. Hey, I think I should get outta here, you know, 'cause I think I'm imposing, you know...
'cause, uh, you never know what's gonna happen.
Oh, thank you.
I know.
Yeah?
It's terrific.
We can digest our-
Oh. And your first wife was Allison?
M'm, that was so nice. That was nice.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
That's, uh...  that's pretty serious stuff there.
M'hm.
You know, and the miserable is everyone else. That's-that's all. So- so when you go through life you should be thankful that you're miserable, because that's- You're very lucky... to be...  ...to be miserable.
Yeah.
Oh, that's hilarious. They're back from Fire Island. They're... they're sort of giving it a chance-you know what I mean?
I have a tiny apartment.
I guess you think that I talked you into something, huh? 
Well, have you ever made love high?
Well, what's the difference, anyway?
Well, I'll give you a shot of sodium pentothal. You can sleep through it.
No, no, no, what... You can once, you can live without it once. Come on.
Let's just do it, all right?
You're so sure about it.
That is the worst kind of paranoia.
Hey, don't knock masturbation! It's sex with someone I love.
And then she mentioned penis envy... Did you know about that?
Well, she said that I was very guilty about my impulses toward marriage, and-and children.
In-in... Alvy, in my dream Frank Sinatra is holding his pillow across my face and I can't breathe.
Sinatra?
Well, she said that I should probably come five times a week. And you know something? I don't think I mind analysis at all. The only question is, will it change my wife?
And what are you doing following me around for, anyway?
That's what you got me here for at three o'clock in the morning, 'cause there's a spider in the bathroom?
I can't sleep with a live thing crawling around in the bathroom.
Yeah.
I got the good chocolate, Alvy.
Yep. I didn't think it was that big, but it's a major spider. You got a broom or something with a-
It's for my complexion.
I mean was there another- I thought I heard a voice.
Oh, I had the radio on.
You know I think that if you let me, maybe I could help you have more fun, you know? I mean, I know it's hard and... Yeah.
Alvy, what about... what if we go away this weekend, and we could-
Yeah, but it's real close.
Yeah, I know. Just-just put on the watch, and-and... that thing, and we'll just...
I'm just not... you know, I don't think I could take a mellow eve- 'cause I-I don't respond well to mellow, you know what I mean, I-I have a tendency to... if I get too mellow, I-I ripen and then rot. You know, and it's-it's not good for my... 
That day in Brooklyn was the last day I remember really having a great time.
The incredible thing about it is, I'm paying for her analysis and she's making progress and I'm getting screwed.
That's sick!
Oh, oh, no, I can't-I can't eat this. I'm nauseous.  If you could-if you could just give me something to get me through the next two hours, you know I-I have to go out to Burbank... and give out an award on a TV show.
Well, uh, Alvy, you wanted to break up just as much as I do.
Oh-
Right. Geez, I feel like there's a great weight off my back. M'mmm.
Oh, Alvy, come on.
That's right, that's right.  You only gave me books with the word "death" in the titles.
You're mad, aren't you?
I'm late.
Yeah, two more chairs and they got a dining-room set.
Me? No, no. I-I couldn't make it that ni- My-my raccoon had hepatitis.
I hope you don't mind that I took so long to finish.
Who said that?
Key word here is "indulgent."
Probably on their first date, right?
Thank you very much. It's a pleasure.
Hey.
Uh, you guys are still-uh, you're still New Yorkers.
Pick up the license. You have to ask nicely 'cause I've had an extremely rough day. You know, my girl friend-
No, I don't! You know, I was in a record store. Listen to this- so I know there's this big tall blond crew-cutted guy and he's lookin' at me in a funny way and smiling and he's saying, "Yes, we have a sale this week on Wagner." Wagner, Max, Wagner- so I know what he's really tryin' to tell me very significantly Wagner.
Right, Max. California, Max.
Forget it, Max.
You all right?
You like this house, Max?
There are no twos, Max.
Yeah. Right.
Let 'im drop dead! Who needs his business?!
Look at you, you-you're such a clown.
Heavy! Eaten by some squirrels.
That was fun. I don't think California is bad at all. It's a drag coming home.
Are you... are you recording? Or do- Are you with any label now?
Well, hey, that's, that's nice. Uh. Oh, listen, this is, uh, Alvy Singer. Do you know Alvy? Uh... and... uh... Tony Lacey.
Hey-
Oh, gosh.
You can have it to use. Why-why are you smiling?
So you were here when they were doing the work on the boundary fence?
It's the way they do things.
Can we... one at a time?  Hold it down, and one at a time.  You're last, Cal.
And you've only just met.
Yeah, I know... But she's only twenty seven and...  The wisdom.  She's an old soul.  She knew that Shostakovich thing.  Did you notice?
Poor Mac.  It's been a bit of a struggle. I'm sure Sally's told you.
I don't know what's going on.  I don't care to guess.  Mac's really unhappy. She isn't there, that's all.  She's no idea what she's playing, not a clue.
I still think she sails above the rest. I mean not like her early films.  But those were all such great directors.
What?
Hey, listen, I love her.  She's Sophia's best friend.  I never said any of this, alright.  I'll deny it on the stand...  You guys are gonna have kids.  That is so great.  Maybe that's what this is all about.  Maybe she doesn't want to do this anymore.  You know adults don't do this for a living.  You guys are gonna have your kids, you'll be directing -- one asshole in the family is enough.  Sophia knew that intuitively.  Look at Clair. Clair's a mess.  Make sure she gets the epidural.  Forget that natural childbirth shit. Everything's going to be what it's supposed to be.  "Life is but a walking shadow.  A poor player who struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more..." And speaking of me, the role of Leo in your film?
Leo.  Leo's twenty-eight, Cal.
You've got a lot of fucking gall.  Thirty nine.
Not this time.
I don't know how to make her funny.
You're coming swimming in the pool, and in a few minutes you won't even remember what it's about.  You won't care who's in your damn movie.
I'll change back before we leave.
You need to knock off the pills, Clair.
You think so!?  I've been working out a lot since the baby. And I've been working.  And that takes it's toll, you know.
You should have brought him.
Would you leave us alone right now?
Take good care of it.
In Cheyene Walk?  Lucy's going to have a meltdown.  Oh, I'm so sorry.
Escape hatch.
We've heard lots about you.
You're crazy baby.  I love you.
Are you my big hard hero?
Do you want me to save you?  Do you want me to save you?
Oh yeah... I'm gonna save you.
A perfect night.
Anytime, sport.
I suppose.  Sally, that's quite a gift. I'm not sure it's in your best interest.
I love you.  Most beautiful woman in the world.
Hardly...
Well, it might be Clair.  They're threatening not to come...
She goes on location tomorrow.  Sally, I'm sorry.  Look, I can't keep her on hold.
And she's a stinking fucking actress, for fuck's sake.
Otis!!!!
Hello?  Last birthday was?
Sally, I have never considered you for this part because you are too old to play it.  And you are out of touch with reality if you think differently.
Well there you go.  I let you off the hook.  You're one goddamn lucky actress.
I had an abortion two weeks ago.
Yes.
Happy anniversary.
It's a novel.
And so I always manage to, do you see? Like the book/script thing, do you see?
He's the best dog in the world.  They're both coming tonight.  Not my idea.
Your Eames table is incredible.  And the B&B.  I just put that in a client's home, actually, but in red.
No you're not.
Hm.
What?
Oh shit.  I'm sorry.
Oh?  It's easy.  You just put one foot in front of the other... That's a good girl.
I think he's really angry with me too.
I'm so glad.  You know, I recognize that passage in your book.  The bit about us running into each other in the movie theatre.
How's he doing?
I left the gate open and Otis got out! He could get hit by a car!
We could hardly say no.
Thank you.  I understand you're an interior decorator.
Well, whoever did this is amazing.
Come on in.
And I'm overwhelmed.  And I want to do it justice.  And I hope we can spend time together.  And I'm gushing.  It's my worst quality.
Yes.
Not to mention Andrew Zhdanov... Otis, come!!
Oh, okay, forgive me.  Your neighbors are here, for fuck's sake.
I don't want it to be just one of our parties.
I wasn't finished.
Okay.
How's the movie going?  Your movie.  You are making a movie, aren't you?
No.  Not something new.
Thank you, Panes.
Yes.
At 4:30 today he barked for a solid fifteen minutes.  I have it on tape.
Monica and Ryan.
I don't think I ever spent half a day in the Beverly Center.
I don't mind...
And here they are!
Ah.
I hope they're watercolors!
We're always in here.  She really gets him, doesn't she?
You'll hate it in London.  It's wet and miserable.  A medical hellhole Sally. It's socialized.  Beds in the corridors. Terrible plumbing.
Well good.  Thank God.
And Cal's this massive adult?
We're fine.  We're great.  We're having a baby and we're moving to London.
Ha!  Not half so not kind as your husband was in his portrayal of you in his novel.
No -- I mean yes -- I mean -- if you don't have other plans.
Wait a minute, that's no soldier -- that's Z!
Well, because he's more than a worker...he's a...what did he call it, Azteca...
Gee, uh, could you say it a little louder, I think there are some ants in the next colony who didn't hear you.
That's not what you said the <u>other</u> <u>night</u> --
Ha!  Don't make me laugh.  You're crazy about me!  That's why you lied and cheated to get near me!
Out here I'm just what?
Well...no, but --
You were right...you were right!  Z, it's <u>beautiful</u>!
We shouldn't be doing this -- it isn't proper!
Of course --
And do Princesses do improper things?
Barbatus, hang on -- Barbatus!!
Geez, and I forgot my toothbrush.
Of course.  The entire royal family will be there to honor you.
...Not enough food?
I tell you son, sometimes, at night, I see myself in battle, fighting a horrible, faceless enemy, with the future of our whole species at stake. And always, the dream ends with each of us plunging his sword into the other's heart...
Yes, what else?
Come on -- everybody dumps on us workers.  You soldiers get all the glory.  Plus you get to go out into the world, meet interesting insects, and kill them.
Get real, Z!  She just dropped the scarf by accident!
It's a sign that you're crazy!  Do you know what the penalty for impersonating a soldier is?
Yeah, I know.
So this is your mother's apartment?
What gives, Baxter? You getting promoted or getting fired?
Oh, I never catch colds.
You should have stayed in bed this morning.
Twenty-seven.
Why not? Now that they're kicking me upstairs --
I almost didn't recognize you -- this is the first time I've ever seen you in civilian clothes.
Just tell 'em -- now and then.
I'm afraid not. I promised to have a drink with him -- he's been calling me all week --
Well, it was just an idea -- I hate to see a ticket go to waste --
Eight-thirty.
In the last six weeks you've only been in my elevator once -- and then you didn't take your hat off.
Don't be too sure. Just because I wear a uniform -- that doesn't make me a Girl Scout.
I understand. Christmas -- family and all that --
That's right.  I told you we had a fight -- that's what it was about -- Miss Olsen -- you know that other girl you saw --
My sister -- she'll want to know what happened to me.
You better figure it out -- exactly. Suppose she asks you why you didn't come home last night?
Who?
Your stomach?
That's right. Will you see that Mr. Sheldrake gets it?
Three. The last one was manager of a finance company, back home in Pittsburgh -- they found a little shortage in his accounts, but he asked me to wait for him -- he'll be out in 1965.
Oh. I can type up a storm, but I can't spell. So they gave me a pair of white gloves and stuck me in an elevator -- that's how I met Jeff --  Oh, God, I'm so fouled up. What am I going to do now?
You are?
Pick up your cards and let's go.
Sure.  What's that funny smell?
I was washing my stockings, so I decided I might as well do your socks.
You mean to someone like Mr. Sheldrake.
I know how you feel, Miss Kubelik. You think it's the end of the world -- but it's not, really. I went through exactly the same thing myself.
No, I don't.
The dishes?
What?
I know.  I suppose you heard about Mr. Sheldrake --?
I told you all along. You see, you were wrong about Mr. Sheldrake.
I love you, Miss Kubelik.
Last night?
Yes, sir.
Are you going to deny it?
Sir?
Mr. Sheldrake, I've got good news for you --
You're working too hard, Baxter. It's New Year's Eve -- relax.
The only thing is I'm staying at the Athletic Club -- and it's strictly stag so if you don't mind --
Don't mind what?
But this is the key to the executive washroom.
Just following doctor's orders. I've decided to become a mensch. You know what that means? A human being.
Sure, sure.  Look, kid -- I put in a good word for you with Sheldrake, in Personnel.
Yes, Mr. Kirkeby.  You still owe me for the last two bottles --
Dobisch -- Joe Dobisch, in Administration.
Look, Baxter -- we're making out the monthly efficiency rating -- and I'm putting you in the top ten. Now you don't want to louse yourself up, do you?
Oh, Buddy-boy. I was just about to call you.  I'm sorry about that mess on the living room wall. You see, my little friend, she kept insisting Picasso was a bum -- so she started to do that mural -- but I'm sure it will wash off -- just eyebrow pencil.
It is?  Well, how about that? No wonder I couldn't get into the executive washroom this morning.
That's a shame. I'll send the key right down. And about your promotion --  -- I'm sending that efficiency report right up to Mr. Sheldrake, in Personnel. I wouldn't be surprised if you heard from him before the day is over.
I hate to disappoint you -- I mean, many happy returns -- but not tonight --
Quite an office -- name on the door -- rug on the floor -- the whole schmear.
There's a girl in my place -- she took some sleeping pills -- you better come quick -- I can't wake her up.
How many pills were in that bottle?
What are you going to do, Doc?
What's her name?
She'll sleep on and off for the next twenty-four hours. Of course, she'll have a dandy hangover when she wakes up --
Kubelik -- with two k's.
It's just that she's got a family -- and there's the people in the office -- look, Doc, can't you forget you're a doctor -- let's just say you're here as a neighbor --
Where are you moving to?
I don't know. All I know is I got to get out of this place.
You know me with girls. Easy come, easy go. Goodbye, Doc.
You like Castro?  I mean -- how do you feel about Castro? BUD What is Castro?
Because as far as I'm concerned, he's a no good fink. Two weeks ago I wrote him a letter -- never even answered me.
Oh. Mixed up in that revolution?
Toot? It's more like a lost weekend. Neither of them showed up for work today.
Dr. Dreyfuss.
What's with you, Fran -- did you forget where you live?
I beg your pardon? MISS OLSEN I'm Miss Olsen -- Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.
So you don't have to play innocent with me. He used to tell his wife that I was the branch manager from Seattle -- four years ago when we were having a little ring-a-ding- ding.
Will you excuse me?
Six weeks. But who's counting?
Let's not start on that again, Jeff -- please. I'm just beginning to get over it.
Important?
I mean -- about my getting a divorce.
What do you think?
Funny thing happened to me at the office party today -- I ran into your secretary -- Miss Olsen. You know -- ring-a-ding-ding? I laughed so much I like to died.
Don't ever talk like that, Fran! Don't make yourself out to be cheap.
I didn't plan it this way, Fran -- actually, it's all Baxter's fault.
Sylvia -- sweetie -- it's not that -- but I promised the guy I'd be out of here by eight o'clock, positively.
Stay with it, Buddy-boy!  Come on, Sylvia.
Why don't we send her to a movie -- like Ben-Hur?
Oh -- I see -- Well, girls, this is Captain -- eh --
Well --
You make some of your closest friends in the army -- war has a way of bringing men together.
Winning the war by yourself.
I'm sure it is, but I had hepatitis.
That's quite an array of ribbons...
Let's talk about you.
Yeah.
We do.
Why they call you that?
A sauciere --
Captain -- they've been probed all this week -- Cong and NVA regulars. There's gonna be a big offense any time.
We're gonna have some help to get in the river. You know these waters, Chief ?
Careful,  Captain, they've been known to charge.
Get in there !
Will they attack?
You want me to clean it up -- simple and quiet.
Hey, buddy, that boat still runs, eh?
Do me a favor buddy, please.
What -- happened here.
He couldn't get through a sentence without all these big words; about why we kill.
Thank you, sir.
What?
Mike, you know anything about the point at Vin Drip Drop?
Hell's Angels Four to Big Duke Six -- we'll need green smoke -- suggest you have the FAC mark it.
Haiphong.
Haiphong? Shit, you jump in ?
No. They put out two or three for every one I needed. When you get to the one you'll use, you just stake it out. If something feels wrong, you just pass it up. On one mission, I had to pass up three and ended up living on rats and chocolate bars.
You were not coming here, to see me?
Do you?
Nah.
No -- no, Captain.
No -- I don't think so. But it'll be back. They were circling. It'll be back.
Captain -- that was all true about the rats and chocolate and stuff?
Sure.
This boat's a mess.
Why did they attack us?
So Kurtz is alive.
May I ask where the Captain is going in his little boat?
Cognac?
What's a big question?
What did you hear?
What if I say no.
Beverly Hills --
34   CONTINUED:
95   CONTINUED:
You'll catch a chill by that dumb waiter shaft.  Sit on the cot.  Keep this pointed at him if I get preoccupied.
27   CONTINUED:
How did she..?
Why?
Did you catch Corbett?
I'll wear it for you.  And I can wear it when we go home.  We won't be here forever.
That's not what I meant.
-- Permanently?
When you ran off, I thought you'd keep going 'til you were back home in Washington.
Let's keep going.  We're only an hour from Devil's Cauldron.
Okay by me.  You're the one likes these hot springs so much.
Where in hell Meyerling dig you up?
There's a cabin, maybe twenty miles south of here.
Don't push me..!
Why offer a buyoff with your gunmen waiting outside?
How come you didn't let him shoot me?
Look, Mr. Desmond, I didn't count on it turning this ugly.
You don't care enough about Sam to --
This miserable wilderness is a state of the union.  Policy's made here the same way as in the civilized world: at the ballot box.  That's the beauty of it -- these icebox cowboys are living a century too late.  Get them on your side, it's like buying Manhattan for beads.  With a handful of votes you control the greatest frontier since white men stumbled onto the New World.
You're out of your greedy goddamn mind.
He saw you and Corbett come in...
You hear me?  Ben?
There's what they're waiting on!
This man's friends ain't gonna look favorably on his incarceration.
I didn't know you had a secret admire.
Go ahead.
Do you love me?
Have they done blood tests on him?
They haven't done the standard scratch test. Where they make small injections into the skin?
No. Actually, I think that's their technical name.
Water...  Nobody told you it might be a good idea to remove the carpeting and drapes in Spencer's room?
I've got Jews at my table.
He's gotta fight to breathe. His asthma can just shoot off the charts -- he's allergic to dust and this is New York and his immune system bails on him when there's trouble so an ear infection...  Is this bothering you?
You're not worried that someone might take him?
Sorry.
Last week I was playing the piano for him and he likes it, and so I decide I'm going to make a little joke...
What about your mother?
Sorry, honey...  I'll be right there.
To get you back at work so you can wait on me.
So. Anything else?
Yes. I'm going to give my queer neighbor a lift to Baltimore.
I want you to go on this trip.
Is there another way to see it?
Are you still coming?
Thanks for being on time... Carol, the waitress, this is Simon, the fag.
I -- uh, I... Well, there is no place cards or anything.
Hey -- you let him...
My son was outside playing soccer. I never saw him playing ball. Come on, you guys -- take me out for a good time... Take me out dancing.
And?
That's not compliment, Melvin... That's just trying to sound smart so I feel stupid... A compliment is something nice about somebody else... Now or never.
Sex with Simon?
This one has a special meaning.
I can trust my brain.
Cute.
What a break...
I'm feeling... I've been feeling better.
I don't think so. You need help with the pants?
No. No. Get Carol.
I can help you if you take the responsibility to keep regular app --
Shhhhhhh. I don't have this mountain of available time...  I got to get to my restaurant on time. Do you know how hard it is for me to be here?
Police! Police! Fucking crooked police...  doughnut-munching morons help me!  Assault and battery and you're black.
Sure -- take him to the vet.
Yeah, but it's all about Simon now... you helped with the dog... And now there are other things. I'm just as concerned as you are about Simon.
If there's some mental health foundation that raises money to help people like you be sure to let me know.
Terrify me?
Is he dead yet?
Okay. So you call 911 and don't leave your name -- even a dumb geezer should know that emergency automatically pulls up your name. How come you make a mistake like that?
Oh, is he dead?
Ask him.
My dog... you know... I mean my little dog with the adorable face... Don't you know what my dog looks like?
Which color was that?
Frank Sachs -- Melvin Udall.
Did you... do something to him?
Thank you. Verdell...  sweetheart?  By the way, thanks for saving me.
It smells like shit in here?
That cleaning woman doesn't...
Where are all your queer party friends?
Oh, my gosh.
Well, I always painted. Always. And my mother always encouraged it. She was sort of fabulous about it actually... and she used to... I was too young to think there was anything at all wrong with it... and she was very natural. She used to pose nude for me... and I thought or assumed my father was aware of it.
Melvin...
I get why you're angry. It's no snap to explain why I was like that, but let's not try to do it on the run...
... Now he's going to want to stay. And they'll want to take a ride to the lake or whatever. So it's a good five hours back. It gives us a chance to take it easy and...
I don't know... Let me sleep on it and figure it out.  Because I'm stuck! Can't go back to what I had... She's evicted me from my life.
What's it mean?
How do you write women so well?
Exactly what is your previous experience?
Nothing. I just watch till something strikes me. Do anything you think of -- try different thing. Until I say, "hold that pose." Then just try and comfortably hold it.
So you're practically finished, huh?
No shit.
Boy, that's fucking genius.  You're a fucking genius.  Then you're just sitting there, bullshitting with me. Man, no way I coulda done that!
What's your name?  We both know it's not Nicholai.
How long have you been freelance?
Tachlinkov.
You understand what's going on?  It makes sense, right?
You think I would be an idiot to pass up five million dollars.
You would be.
Send the file.  I'll have the estimate tonight.
Who?
Deadline?
I have been sitting on a contract from Cleveland for six days because of you.
Who is that other guy?
He stole the contract knowing that I would come after him.
I don't need the money.
How?
What I'm trying to say is that -- I'm not sure I can do this, help you, unless I know more about you.
Yes.  As soon as you get into this business, all you can think about is getting to the top.  That's all there is.  Until then, there is nothing.  You are nothing.
I was just different.
Why?
They become complicated... messy.
Did it ever bother you?
You said you didn't trust it.
No.
Do you think about the game?
What do you think he's doing?
How was the beach?
Two way?
Transmits and receives.
But he won't shoot you right then?
I'll be walking out of the bank, unarmed.  You'll have the gun and I'll drive the car.
Ten years ago.
I hate bishops.  They're useless.  I like knights.
Isn't it interesting though?  I mean, look at us, in this room.  Or yesterday, when we were walking in the plaza market.  I mean, we look like just another couple.  But what are we?  Doesn't it seem so crazy?
No.
Can I ask you something?
Did you --
When I gave you my gun and you almost shot me.
Maybe you should see a psychiatrist.
Would you like a drink?
Do you believe that?
Why not?
You're pretty famous aren't you?
That's true Doug, writers are supposed to write.
Okay, we're listening. But I'm with Katka on this one.
I feel like a mole in this joint, so I guess I might as well come out lookin' like one!
Yeah, that was Honza's idea, I had to buy him a few beers in return for the gear.
Really, "The Freeman Centre"?
But how did the wall get here?
Sounds like a good reason to leave it alone.
We're going to need it all.
No, not yet.
What happened to Katka?
A fine specimen for conversion.
Your too good for this town, Buddy.
I had a visit from the British Embassy. They think I'm a stray soccer hooligan.
I stopped by your office. Henry was steaming, he says he's going to throw you out of the window and that you never worked at the Bugler.
Did you see a lawyer and go before a judge?
You're kidding.
God, I think I need a holiday.
Yeah, no problem.
I can't go with him.
You don't understand, I can't!
Take this exit.
Yes.
Well, I'll try and get that clarified. As I understand it though, the charges include break and enter, theft, trespass, operating an unlicensed facility, vandalism and destruction of government documents - Whatever possessed you to start destroying people's medical records?
Doug, haven't seen you for a while.
Really?
I could pencil you in if you like?
Lawrence is getting derogatory again.
But I don't want to go, I am enjoying it.
I hope you're going to invite me in?
But we could go to London and live in England.
Interesting. Do reckon I could fit through here?
I'll do my best. Is the place open.
Ah, so what?
A month, Jesus! And how do I know you're not crapping me?
What for?
No act of love but willing violence demanded by one and begged by the other. As life turned to fantasy and reality to ecstasy a need, so deep no light could reach, surfaced like a nocturnal creature unearthed for momentary and glorious display. Left alone in a rose-tinted afterglow dimming fast she tasted the moisture of her body and wondered why light came to day and such desires to her pale-skin body.
Alright, go help Chris shovel up the last of the crap.
Who you saving the dishes for?
Better than you.
Why don't we both forget about him?
Weren't you going to get some glasses?
That's right.
You will wish you hadn't.
What is it you want?
I'm not sure it's possible.
Hey Doug, where you been?
So, he didn't fire you?
Yeah, so I hear. Don't you think you should go get changed?
Shall I look after the rest?
Josh, I have to speak you, it's urgent.
You know everyone can be controlled Pavel. Where are you storing the personnel files?
Have you lost all control of this city?
He wants to show now.
You're fine like that, Mom.
I haven't seen Clay or Eric lately.
Honey, some of this is... farfetched. You take after me. People skills and common sense. Good dependable qualities.
I meant he's a doctor.
Everything's being done but it's not enough. I have to find something -- more.
Where is he? He's supposed to be here.
I'm very sorry --
-- This your idea of small talk?
'I hope your dreams come true.'
You're like this fly, buzzing buzzing everywhere --
What the -- ?!
It's private.
Spend a year in the Peace Corps. Make a medical discovery --
I'll get something for us to drink --
What is that?
Yeah.
My relationship with God is my own.
You're not in a very good mood.
Or anywhere where people might see us.
Why are you doing all this? To impress me?
Yes. But not as a date date.
Excuse me?
Assholes. This happen to you?
That what you do?
One of your secrets.
What are you thinking?
Will you do something for me?
Up to?
Boys like him have -- expectations.
Maybe. But that's not the real reason. You think if I tell, he'll disappear and that's what you want! Me all to yourself!
When Mom died you told me God wanted her more, loved her more --
I'm sorry she never got her miracle.
Like you'd make it to June. Even cutting half your classes, you have a B- average.
Now I can do what I want.
Finding the real world to your liking, Mr. Carter?
For the inner satisfaction it will bring.  Saturday mornings, I'd like you to tutor disadvantaged students at our sister school --
It's mine to give. I didn't steal it.
I don't get it. How come there's no rock 'n roll?
I beg your pardon?
Oh yeah.
How could I forget?  Oh, sure, I remember you.
Then you'll be going to school here....?
Is that what you were going to ask me, George? To go to the dance?
Fine..
Christ, it's a miracle I was even born! 
Huh?
Your line, George!
I'm sorry, there's no answer.
The future? What are you talking about? Where's Shemp?!
4200 rads...  That certainly can't be generated under controlled conditions in this day and age.
Well, it was there.
You didn't?
...He just lets himself get pushed around all the time! People walk all over him and he never fights back, never stands up for himself.
No self confidence, I guess... At least you don't take after him.
What you been doing?
That your spider in there? In that bottle?
Holly.
Well, that I shouldn't be seen with anybody that collects garbage.
Anybody ever call you "Red"?
There's an old Fudgesicle over there. You want it?
Gosh, what was everybody talking about?
Listen, maybe we ought to tell somebody about this.
Look at all this junk.
I don't want a steak.
Don't.
No.
Maybe we should've tried to hop it.
It was going too fast.
I could've pulled the car up on the tracks, slowed it down some.
You know... they'd probably ask to see your driver's license before they hired you.
What's that?
Good deal... Oh, uh, we're on the run and we'd like to hang out here for a while. Couple of hours, maybe. How'd that be?
Hi, whatcha doing?
Listen, ah... We're going to take the Cadillac for a while. How'd that be?
You're my friend, aren't you?
Forgive the butterfingers, Buckaroo.  Casper Lindley, Knight of the Blue Shield, at your disposal.  And my son, Scooter.
Got a half a tuna sandwich.
And his soul black as the Ace of Spades.
Everybody ready?  How do we look?  Do we look okay?
Dead.  Damnit!
It's Whorfin, Buckaroo.  Line 3.
Just their side.  What're we gonna do with these people?  They're illegal aliens, the way I figure, been here forty years, you could throw the book at 'em...
I guess 'cause you remind me of someone I once knew, long ago before any of this craziness.
Who were you really trying to kill last night?
Somewhere.  See I was taken away by the Priddies when I was a baby.  I was adopted.
You don't wanna know.
Yes, I do.  Gimme a chance.  I'm stronger than you think.
Never.
It's too dangerous.
Stay here, I'll be back.
Not here!  No Overthruster!
But John Whorfin said kill her.
How long you been riding with Buckaroo, Reno?
That's why I wear a fifty dollar hat.  Was a two hundred dollar hat, I hadda kill you.
Now twenty seconds downrange...Perfect Tommy, how on earth is Buckaroo able to keep that thing on the ground?
Perhaps the three of us, Mr. Fink.
Please, Barton.
Well, Bill was ALWAYS the author, so to speak-
All right Barton, I'll see if I can slip away-
I'll try to slip out. If he quiets down, passes out... I'm afraid he thinks – well, he said you were a buffoon, Barton. He becomes irrational–
What DID you mean?
Sir, I'm flattered that you even recognize my name. My God, I had no idea you were in Hollywood.
...Huh? No, I'm –
On the Beery picture! Where are we? Wuddya got?
I'm afraid I don't really understand that genre. maybe that's the prob-
Well, I've talked to Bill Mayhew-
Caught me trying to be fancy! Yeah, that's it, Bart.
Hell, I could tell you some stories–
I can see you feel pretty strongly about it.
Well, I don't mean to get up on my high horse, but why shouldn't we look at ourselves up there?  Who cares about the Fifth Earl of Bastrop and Lady Higginbottom and – and – and who killed Nigel Grinch-Gibbons?
Charlie. How are you.
...Got a sweetheart?
Well, it's been better. I can't seem to get going on this thing. That one idea, the one that lets you get started – I still haven't gotten it. Maybe I only had one idea in me – my play. Maybe once that was done, I was done being a writer.  Christ, I feel like a fraud, sitting here staring at this paper.
Well, I guess you pick your poison.
...Will you stay with me till they get here?
Hold on –
Stop with the police! Wake up, friend! This does not look good! They hang people for this!
Everything's okay, believe me. I know it's rough mentally, but everything's taken care of.
You gotta get a grip on, brother. You gotta just carry on – just for a few days, till I get back. Try and stay here, keep your door locked. Don't talk to anyone. We just gotta keep our heads and we'll figure it out.
It's more than I've got.
...Don't look at me like that, neighbor.  It's just me – Charlie.
But Charlie – why me? Why –
Yeah... rye whiskey?
Yes sir, they –
Well, I'm going to be working here, mostly at night; I'm a writer. Do you have room service?
...Yeah, he... he lives next door to me.
What did... What did he –
Charlie... Charlie's back...
Yeah, and I'm Buck Rogers.
Also known as Madman Mundt.
Ya know, Fink, ordinarily we say anything you might remember could be helpful. But I'll be frank with you: That is not helpful.
Second one of your friends to end up dead.
Sixth floor too high for you, Fink?
Mr. Lipnik, I –
Yes, Colonel.
The boat blew.  There was a leak in the gas line.  There were two previous repairs.  There was a five-mil policy on both of 'em.  A real heavy investigation.  Zilch. Goose-egg.  It was an accident.
I can get my butt kicked for this. You're not supposed to be in here.
So -- how are things?
How about the coke?
Yes.
I need a cigarette.
She's really sick you know.  Don't you know what she's doing?  She knows I went to Berkeley.  She knows I knew Noah.  She makes up that story about me.  She's handing you somebody who's obsessed with he her.
Did you leave the club with him?
Do you have a cigarette?
Yes, you do.
I told you -- I quit.
How did you feel when I told you Johnny Boz had died -- that day at the beach.
I don't know anything that isn't police business.
Four shootings in five years.  All accidents.
There's a name from the past.
Noah was my counselor in my freshman year.  That's probably where I got the idea for the icepick.  For my book. Funny how the subconscious works.  Hazel is my friend.
What happened, Nick?  Did you get sucked into it? Did you like it too much?
What if I call you Nicky?
Did you think it was so special?
No.
About three months before I met you.
You paid $50,000 for your character?
How'd you get in here?
How did it end?
Exactly what do you have in mind, Mr. Corrigan.
How did he die?
How's that?
What was the weapon?
Nope, can't say that I do.
Talcott doesn't usually show up at the office 'till after his 18 holes. What are they nervous about?
Was she ever suspect?
What's goin' down, son?
I don't know.
I don't think it's funny.
What in the hell for?  You think I'm gettin' any at my age?  I don't like blue-haired women.  I don't like 'em.
You don't like punk rockers?
It doesn't make sense.  She didn't know me three months ago.
I don't understand what the hell's going on here, pop.
Catherine told me what was in it.
Where the hell you goin'?
Sometimes I think he started banging her just to get himself off the hook with Internal Affairs.
You look like dogshit.
What was the motive?
How the fuck do you know?  What is it with you and this broad anyway?
Gus -- go over to Berkeley. Harrigan -- find out what else she's published.  Andrews -- get the files on her parents' accident. Carbon Beth on everything.  I want some psychological input on this Andrews and Harrigan go; Nick is left there with Gus.
She's a suspect.
Who are you?
I like the one with the dragon's heads a lot. But the black one's filled up with too many heads...  I'd take some of them out.  I think you're painting too fast. I wouldn't put in so many heads. Let it breathe a bit.
This is painted on a backdrop from the Kabuki theater in Japan. I painted it after Joseph Beuys died. A rebirth painting. I felt like he could've painted it, or maybe someone else was painting it instead of me. The Chinese calligraphers used to change their name mid-career so they could start over as someone else..
Do you ever get sick of it?
Of what?
What about the shit they write?
Ohhh. That's new. That sounds good.
Andy, man, thanks for coming. I'd like to paint your jacket.
Cool.
That girl looks just like my old girlfriend Gina.
Gee. You shouldn't take it so seriously, Jean. That's why you can't stop taking drugs. You always think people don't like you. Everyone likes you.
Aren't they?
No.
Jean, your parents are here.
... Can you... decipher this for us?
Why, that's from Time Magazine.
Yeah.
It's Maria Portos. What should we do?
Who am I?
Come on, Jean. Get rid of your cigarette. Concentrate.
Check you later, man.
Good. What do you have?
I guess it was a long time ago.
Sit down! You're gonna fall out!
... I'll buy you some new ones.
I hadn't thought about it.
He's not. He's out of town and he calls me every day. What's weird about him?
So. Are you ready? I start Columbia next fall. Of course, there's like, a year of pre-med stuff, but – whatever. I'm really excited.  And: Rene gave me a job as his secretary. His poems are getting published.
How is he?
That's great.
I've seen you before. I like your paintings a lot. Your hair was different.
What? Life's beautiful. Depression isn't permanent. Don't you believe that?  What is it – did your girlfriend leave you?
What? What do you want?
So keep painting.
So what?
Jean? Hold this, please.  You'll get there. But it's good to have something to fall back on. That's why I became an electrician. It pays the rent. Y'know, I'm an artist, too.
OK! Goodbye!
Uh-oh!
You're selling and ending the culture. Not one bit of information. Only to get the money and growl with the power, man.
It's cold.
Where's the fire?
You're the second man who killed me this week.  But hey, no prob ... I've got seven lives left.
Touring the riot scene.  Gravely assessing the devastation. Upstanding mayor stuff.
Ah, the direct approach.  I admire that in a man with a mask.  But you don't really think you'll ever win, playing it your way ..?
I think you're jealous that I'm a genuine freak, and you have to wear a mask!
Well, I could ... free up some time...
Well ... How can I put this. There were two truths ... and she had trouble reconciling them. Because <u>I</u> had trouble reconciling them.  Vicki said.
Photojournalist.
Well?  Was "Vicki" right?  About your difficulty with duality?
It's the so-called "normal" guys who always let you down.  Sickos never scare me.  At least they're commited.
There's a big, comfy California King over in Bedding.  What say we ...
A kiss under the mistletoe. Mistletoe can be deadly, if you eat it ...
Not compared to that "Cobblepot" person you're promoting...
I don't know what you want, but I know I can get it for you with a minimum of fuss.  Money, jewels, a very big ball of string...
Selina!  Selina Kyle!?  You're fired!  And Bruce -- Bruce Wayne! Why are you dressed up as Batman?
Silent night, violent night...
Well, um... funny thing, your penguins... they're not responding to the launch command.  Fact they're kind of turned around now... Like someone jammed our signal...
A lot of tape and a little patience make all the difference.  By the way, how's Fred Adkins, your old partner?
We need signatures.  To overturn the ballot.  I can supply those, Oswald.
Sidetracked?  Oswald, this is your chance to fulfill a destiny that your parents carelessly discarded ...
And a very, very good one.
I damn well better be.  In fact I want you to phone those goniffs over at Gotham Insurance and tell them --
Don't tell me you're on his side. Again.
Alfred, if I've never told you...I just want to say...
I love you, old man.
Alfred, are you...?
Keep it.
Hey, what's your problem?
Street racing isn't exactly an acceptable major at Oxbridge.  They kicked me out.  it doesn't matter. I've won enough money to do what I've always dreamed.
What exactly are you doing?
I can't believe we were fighting over a  bad guy.
Me too.  Great stems, though.
Actually, I already work for you. Or did.  Your arboreal preservation project in South America.
I can't.  But perhaps tonight, over dinner...I've just had an opening.
Let me get this straight. A brilliant citizen, disfigured by a horrible accident, re-emerges as a psychotic super-villain bent on theft, revenge and destruction. You see a pattern here?
I got the diamond.  Quell problemo, Bruce?
He's dying.  And I can't deal with it.
McGregor's Syndrome.  That's what Freeze's wife had.
Like hell you do.
Hail the all-knowing Bruce Wayne. Here's what I know, she loves me, Not you and it's driving you crazy. It's why you stopped us from kissing. Because if you can't have her, nobody can.
She's clouded your mind.  You're not thinking straight.
Where is my wife?
There was nothing I could do.  Batman deactivated her.  She's dead.
Can't we just ice them along with the rest of the citizenry?
I've got to stop him.
You have to tell me what you're doing with my Venom.
Our work?
Why, indeed?
Could I let Batman go? For Dick. For me. Could I leave the shadows? Have a life. Friends. Family...
Old habits die hard. Are you alright?
There's one other thing. I feel..
What?
Recognition, of course.
What now sir?
All except the prototype with the sonar modifications you so disapprove of. But it hasn't yet been tested.
I'm flattered. Not every girl makes a super-hero's night table.  You might have some interesting insights into Two-Face.
What's wrong?
Now black rubber.
Try a fireman. Less to take off.
Welcome to my parlor said the Riddler to the Bat. How's tricks?
We'll talk some other -
What? Oh, Edward. Hi. Congratulations. Great party-
Rinka.
The infamous Wayne charm. Does it ever shut off?
So what you're saying, this guy's a total wacko, right?
You understand obsession better than you let on.
Come on, Bruce. This is what I do for a living.
In a sense we are all two people. The side we show in daylight. And that side we keep in shadow.
There's something I want to talk with you about. It's...Well, we.. I...
What?
I always thought it was the bat that scared me that night that changed my life. But it wasn't. The real fear was hiding underneath: what I read in the journal, that my parents' deaths were my fault. That's what I couldn't remember. That's the crime I've been paying for all these years.
You don't understand. It's an addiction. You fight night after night, trying to fill the emptiness. But the pain's back in the morning. And somewhere along the way it stops being a choice.  I want better for you.
Exactly. And once you'd killed him you'd be lost. Like me.  All this has to be a choice. Otherwise...it's a curse.
Who is it?
Uh, yeah. Thanks, Mr..uh...Face.
Go ahead. You can say it.
A hit.
Yes?
I don't want to jeopardize anyone close to me.
You could've killed him, you know. You could've killed the Joker.
I can't do that. Not while the Joker's still at large.
Do you sail?
I'll take you home if you'd like.
Keep her on the line!
How can you do that if she's already off the line?
What now?
Then for God's sake, Harvey, cancel the anniversary celebration.
You shouldn'ta turned the gun on that kid, man.  You shouldn'ta --
Okay, a break-in.  Trash the office, make off with the books ... "Industrial espionage."
All right, then. Here's the deal. Total amnesty... and the sum of ten million dollars, payable in --
I'll see you burn.  I'll see you dead -- GET AWAY FROM ME!!
Evildoers, huh?  Big or small?
Small so far.  I think he's leaving the big fish for Harvey Dent.
Yum, yum.
Everybody needs a hobby.  You explain it, Vicki.  He walks out on his own party.  Half an hour later, who turns up?  Batman.  Sees an execution, freaks out in an alleyway.  No place to change.
Sounds great.  Excellent.  Though-, Ahm... there's this guy who's coming to work at the Gallery, from England...
David - are you ever going to learn to say 'no'?
Ali?  What's wrong?
I was sort of half way through the sentence in which I would have asked him when it suddenly seemed like a mistake.
Annie, it's me.
I was hoping DU.  Bean might take a look at my computer project today.
It's great when people who work together can become real friends.
Everything okay, David?
I thought perhaps as Vice-President, and in view of the unfortunate attendance's for the summer show this year... the MASSIVE financial LOSS ...
... you have to sack me.  I understand, sir.  I'll go quietly.  In fact I'll go right now.
David, David, David ...
Bye, Dad.
You've known me five years Elmer. When do you get to calling me David?
... in the distant future.
Whoa! I think I just figured something out Beavis.
What?
Huh huh huh. He said "anus."
Nnnnooo. Oooooh nooooo.
Dammit! Huh huh. That chick wants me.
Huh huh. This says Beavis.
Huh huh huh. That chick was talking about doing it.
So, uh, huh huh. Are we gonna score now?
Me first.
Heh heh. We're in Washington!
Damn, huh huh.
Huh? Huh huh.
C'mon, Beavis, just start running really fast when you hit the ground. It'll work.
Dill-wad...
Oh, there are so many slots you won't know where to begin.
They perk me right up.
Hey, Butt-Head, it's that slut from the plane!
Uh, we didn't score yet.
Does that say Xanax?
Ah, the witness?
Bork! You are a federal agent. You represent the United States Government... Never end a sentence with a preposition. Try again.
Do her? Huh huh.
Uh, yeah. Does she have big hooters?
You were a roadie for Motley Crue?
Shut up, dumb-ass! You didn't score. I scored with both of them...
Manchurian Tung oil?  Where did you get it?
Don't forget the balls, Ernie.
Slow down there, honey... I don't want the vibration to weaken the model.
This fire wasn't burning when we left the house.
I guess... if I'm going to be dead, I'll just have to be the best dead person ever!
Adam, we <u>are</u> in hell.  I hate these people.
They make gypsies look good.
We're trapped in this house forever... with those... people.
That little girl saw us.
We're not going to wait here like cornered animals.  I can tell you that.  We need help.  I'm going to talk to that little girl.
I didn't do that one... Hmmm.
But <u>we</u> let him out.
He might have hurt somebody.
We've been given a gift here, honey.  A real live little girl. She likes us a lot.  She needs us. Maybe that's why we died so young, to keep us from getting so... attached to <u>things</u>.  The house, antiques, your model.  Look at us. We didn't have room for anyone.
What time is it?
You can actually see us?  Without the sheets?
We were trying to scare your mother.
Uh-uh.  Only if you got <u>above</u> a C on science.
Wait for who?
<u>So</u> you, the dead, want me, <u>the</u> <u>undead</u>, to throw the live guys -- Mommie, Daddy and Lolita, who might not mind a tumble with an older guy, out into the cold? Even though they have paid hard casharoonie for your dump?
We tried.
Just one daughter.
Folks, be reasonable here.  I'm at your service.  You be the judge. I'm a harmless guy.  Try me.
Tell the truth.
No, Lydia, we're dead.
Oh, honey... I didn't mean anything ... it's just too big for you two. I know these things.
No, I mean they've gone. Decamped.  Split.  Vanished.
Where'd they go?
I don't know what that signal means.
I am <u>not</u>!  Beetle... Juice?
God, you're anatomically correct!
Dad.  Do you believe me?
Yes.  Except when you creep around in your mother's --
I can't <u>bring</u> the ghosts.  They're not here!
Lydia, I will never forgive you for embarrassing me in front of my social inferiors.  You help us with these ghosts or you'll be sorry.
Okay?
'I' will tell you what is boring.  Once you cover up the wallpaper, knock down a few walls, alter the traffic patterns, and -- perhaps -- only perhaps -- think about an inground pool -- the place <u>might</u> just be livable.  What's on the third floor?
Are they still here, Otho?
It's bad luck.  And I believe hugely in luck.
You were wrong, it did hurt.
Yes. I think so, too.
However, with injuries such as this, I have run into minor hemorrhaging, which really isn't too serious at the time, but can cause secondary problems if not looked after.
Oh, fine.
... Were you going somewhere?
... Oh.  ... My God, I only wish that Benjamin had your recuperative powers... Anyway, the President offered to sit in for Ben at the meeting, quite a nice gesture, I felt. He's due here soon, I believe.
... Oh? You've heard?
... It's five of, you'd best get on in there.
I would like to walk today.
Yes, he is different... Not the kind of person one usually meets in Washington.
Of course, Doctor, I understand.
I don't think that's entirely true, Grover.
Oh, yes.
I see.  ... Say, would you mind seeing our family doctor?
No, Eve. I'm not related to Basil and Perdita.
... Would you like us to notify anyone for you?
Chauncey, I wanted to tell you how dreadful I feel about the accident today, but that I'm delighted that you are staying with us.
Yes.
I'm sorry...  ... And what about Louise? YOU mentioned that she had gone, were you close to her also?
Chauncey...
Thank you, Eve.
That's good. I like to watch, too.
Then, I'll be brief. I covered the President's speech at the Financial Institute today, and since the Post would like to be as exact as possible, we would appreciate your comments on the meeting that took place between Mr. Rand, the President and yourself.
Good, sir. And so, it seems, did the President - but we would like to have some facts; such as, uh... What exactly is the relationship between yourself and that of the First American Financial Corporation?
Yes. It's a very good show.
Can you see well?
Yes. It's very tiny, but it's good.
Yes. Tell me, Mr. Gardiner - do you by any chance enjoy Krylov's fables? I ask this because there is something... there is something Krylovian about you.
Do you think so? Do you think so?
So you know your Krylov in Russian, do you? Mr. Gardiner, I must confess I had suspected as much all along - I know an educated man when I meet one!
Oh, good.
Welcome to Rand Memorial Hospital, Mr. Gardiner.
Thank you, Ben. The garden that I left was such a place. Everything which grew there was with the labor of my own hands. I planted seeds and watered them and watched everything grow.
He was quite impressed with your comments, Chauncey - he hears my sort of analysis from everyone, but yours, unfortunately - seldom if ever at all.
Oh, sure you do, the financial assistance program. I think you might be just the man to take charge of such an undertaking. I'd like you to meet with the members of the Board, we'll be able to discuss the matter at greater length at that time.
Oh, I see.
Watch? You mean just watch me? Doing it alone?
I can't write.
Yes. I would like to go to Rand Memorial Hospital.
... Sir?
... Did you wish to see someone, sir?
... Then you really are a gardener?
Your appearance doesn't suggest that at all, Mr. Chance.
It's starting to swell, is it painful?
No - but Mr. Rand does have one with an electric motor, that way he can get around by himself.
No. I don't object.
Come now, Mr. Gardiner, before his speech at the Financial Institute the President consulted with you and Benjamin Rand, did he not?
No.
... We shall need some proof of your having resided here, Mr. Chance.
Move out? I don't understand, Thomas.
As long as the roots are not severed, all is well and all will be well in the garden.
Try again.
I may be a shut-in, but I do not lack for news. I'm sorry you had to go through all that.
Reasonable? Good, I'd like to meet a reasonable man. Why don't you ask this Gardiner to join us for dinner?
Good evening, Mrs. Rand.
Oh, I've been just dying to meet you, Mr. Gardiner!
It's your damn job. It never happened when you were a senator...
I really don't know, Tom - he seems so honest and simple... In a way, he's quite charming...
It's that gardener!
Yes, Chauncey Gardiner.
No! He's a real gardener!
... Business, bullshit! Going out in the middle of the night to meet that bitch in a bar...
We have nothing on him, Ambassador Skrapinov.
What do you mean there is nothing? That's impossible.
Gardiner, yes, sir.
I do not want Benjamin Rand disturbed! You have other ways of gathering information than to trouble a dying man. Use whatever agencies are necessary to put together a detailed history of Chauncey Gardiner, if you run into problems, alert Honeycutt.  I'll be in the office at seven in the morning and I would like to have it at that time.  I've got to take a leak.
No, sir.
Sorry to disturb you, chief but we have new developments.
You take care too, Bobby.
Tell your friends.
She's very beautiful.
Did you eat?
So how was it? What was he doing?
I'm getting rid of the fucking animals.
I'm getting rid of the animals. I've lost interest. Besides, they're standing between you and me.
What's that?
We love her, Craig. I'm sorry.
Don't forget me.
Things change. Anyway, you gave up your claim to that love the first time you stuck your dick in Maxine.
I'm sorry for everything.
I'm through with puppets, Lotte. I just want you to know that.
Really? For most people it's a rather pleasant experience. What exactly did you...
Schwartz.
Security.
You think so, eh? Which comes first, L or... Glooph?
One hundred and five. Carrot juice.  Lot's of it. I swear, it's almost not worth it. I piss orange. Oh, and I, have to piss sitting down... like a godamn girly... every fifteen minutes. But nobody wants to die, Schwartz.
Dr. Lester, while I am flattered that you share your feelings with me, I believe perhaps the workplace is not the most suitable environment for this type of discussion.
Yessir.
More beet-spinach juice, my friend?
I see. Are you unhappy at our little company?
No sir, not at all. It's just that I'm going to open my own business and...
There are rules, boy, procedures, etiquette. This is not a toy. I've been waiting seventy years to utilize this room, grooming myself, quietly setting the stage, performing ablutions, paying tribute, seeing all his motion pictures again and again. Worshipping, Schwartz, worshipping properly.
I just wanted to say “hi.”  Did you know I still don't know your name or where you work?
Why not?
I am dubious, but I don't welsh. Meet me at The Stuck Pig. Seven o'clock. You're late, I walk. So help me, if I find out you cheated.
Made it. Maxine. Maxine, Maxine, Maxine.
Buy you a drink, Maxine?
You married?
That's the usual?
I don't think so. I've fallen in love. This is what people who've fallen in love look like.
Well, Don, I peeked in here, even though I know it's against floor policy. and I discovered that there's a little tiny door in here. Isn't it cute? It's almost like a little dolly's door. I wonder what it’s for.
No.
Boy, this is a toughie. To be honest, I didn't anticipate this.
And as I said, sir, we can't very well exert physical persuasion upon the sacred vessel Malkovich.
Right, Lester. I heard you the first time. I'm not a dummy.
We saw his show at the Luxor last night.
A scary dream?
Oh, he's good! Great, actually. I saw him do "Tru" with his sixty foot Robert Morse puppet. Sensational.
Kevin, I'm telling you... it was like nothing I've...
Yeah yeah yeah. Yadda yadda yadda. Were you stoned?
I blew it, Dr. Lester.
Oh, didn't anyone show you the indoctrination video?
It's Craig in there, I can tell.
I love you, Lotte.
But Maxine, I thought it was me you loved.
Never heard of it.
Broadway's finest three hours. It's about the suppression of the individual. Conformity as God in modern society.
You don't know me, but I'm a great admirer of yours.
Can I get you a drink?
Thanks so much for coming over.
Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!  What the fuck is going on? I'm not talking. This is not me!
Apparently you can control this Malkovich fellow now.
I'll say you are. Let's do it on his kitchen table, then make him eat an omelette off of it.
You see, Maxine, it isn't just playing with dolls.
Wait a minute! What if everybody knew? What if we presented Malkovich as the world's most complicated puppet and me as the only puppeteer sophisticated enough to work him? We'd wipe the floor with the Great Mantini!
You've got to be kidding.
Honey, we can be happy and poor together.
I am not a child, Captain Mertin, but rather an adult lady of miniature proportions.
I see. Well, it is not my fault that thou art tiny. So if it is charity yer after, then be gone with ye, ye foul demon.
Folks came.
If I call them, and they come what on earth am I going to say to them.
No, Stamp. I ain't.
YOU HURT ME.
YOU NEVER FORGOT ME?
Don't talk like that. Your mama loves you.
Don't pay to complain.
Your mother all right?
You think I should stop by? Think she'd welcome it?
Yes ma'am.
You know what? I've been here since I was fourteen and I remember like yesterday when Baby Suggs, holy, came here and sat right where you are. Whiteman name of Garner brought her. He and Mr. Bodwin were good friends. That's how she got that house you all live in. Other things too.
I never went to those woodland services but she was always nice to me. Always. Never be another like her.
Could be that fall you took.
No, let her rest.
Hold back Denver - I'm fine..You..you go on upstairs. I'll do the cleaning up.
Mama...Mama she's asleep. Why don't you eat something.
Was over to Baby Suggs.
The church!
Sethe. He took up with her and stayed in there and you don't want nothing to-
Well, who can tell what went on in there? I never even knew who Sethe was or none of her people.
Sure he knew her. Her boy Halle, too.
Oh but we got to. How we gonna know our price in the future? How are children's children's children gonna know what they cost? Who's gonna tell them? What are they gonna pay for us, if we free?
I was there Paul D...There in the yard. When she did it.
She scares me. I scare me. And that girl in her house scares me.
All he can. All he can.
I'm tired, Paul. So tired. I have to rest a while.
Yeah, yeah I know. Okay.
What do you think?
And we know which Lebowski you are, Lebowski.
We've had some terrible news.  Mr. Lebowski is in seclusion in the West Wing.
I'm not a--ah, fuck it, just stay away from my fucking lady friend, man.
NUSSING!
Nothing.
This is a hundred and eighty dollars.
I'm going home, Donny.
Almost five!
I was bowling--
Shut the fuck up, Donny!  V.I. Lenin! Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov!
Are you gonna split hairs?
Fuck you man!  You don't like my fucking music, get your own fucking cab!
--had a rough night, and I hate the fucking Eagles, man--
That is indeed Mr. Lebowski with the first lady, yes, taken when--
Mr. Lebowski is disabled, yes.  And this picture was taken when Mrs. Reagan was first lady of the nation, yes, yes? Not of California.
Far out.
Nancy's pretty good.
Wonderful woman.  We were very--
These are Mr. Lebowski's children, so to speak--
They're not his, heh-heh, they're not literally his children; they're the Little Lebowski Urban Achievers, inner-city children of promise but without the--
Color?
Uh-huh.  That some kind of Eastern thing?
Oh, hey man, how are ya?  I wondered if I'd see you again.
Wouldn't miss the semis.  How things been goin'?
Thanks, Gary...Take care, man, I gotta get back.
Of course, you do get the good with the bad.  The new technology permits us to do exciting things with interactive erotic software.  Wave of the future, Dude.  100% electronic.
Me?  How would I know?  The only reason she ran off was to get away from her rather sizable debt to me.
Of course, there's that to discuss. Refill?
Who the fuck are you, man!  Come on, man!
Who the fuck are you?  Why've you been following me?  Come on, fuckhead!
Yes Mr. Lebowski, these unfortunate souls cannot love in the true sense of the word.  Our mutual acquaintance Bunny is one of these.
Listen, Maude, I'm sorry if your stepmother is a nympho, but I don't see what it has to do with--do you have any kalhua?
Lord.  You can imagine where it goes from here.
I, uh... money, yeah, I gotta respecfully, 69 you know, tender my resignation on that matter, 'cause it looks like your mother really was kidnapped after all.
The main guy, Dieter--
Well--yeah, I guess--
Well, no, not exactly.  It's a complicated case, Maude.  Lotta ins. Lotta outs.  And a lotta strands to keep in my head, man.  Lotta strands in old Duder's--
Uh-huh.
Finder's fee?
It's not my father's money, it's the Foundation's.  Why did he think you had it?  And who does?
But your father--he runs stuff, he--
Look, Jeffrey, I don't want a partner. In fact I don't want the father to be someone I have to see socially, or who'll have any interest in rearing the child himself.
Forget it, Donny.  You're out of your element.
You mean--beyond pacifism?
Huh?
Yes you're wrong.  This isn't a fucking game, Walter--
There is no fucking hand-off, Walter! At a wooden bridge we throw the money out  of the car!
Your wheel, Dude!  I'm rolling out!
Aitz chaim he, Dude.  As the ex used to say.
Huh?  The problem is--what do you mean what's the--there's no--we didn't-- they're gonna kill that poor woman--
Who's got a fucking million fucking dollars parked in the trunk of our car out here?
They kept saying they believe in nothing.
Walter, if you're there, pick up the fucking phone.  Pick it up, Walter, this is an emergency.  I'm not--
Goddamnit Walter!  You fucking asshole!
Shit!
Shut the fuck up.  Hello?
Right, Dude.
Is this a--what day is this?
Dude.
Brandt, give him the envelope.
Look at that fucking phony, Dude! Pretending to be a fucking millionaire!
I said out.  Now.
Over the line, Smokey!  I'm sorry. That's a foul.
Yeah, but--
Why?
how long since he was bitten?
Like cancer with a purpose.
Anyone else make it?
Because one of us is going to kill the other before this ends.
It doesn't have to be like that.  We don't have to be enemies.
Sounds like a plan.
The genetic material you spliced into Nomak --  Where did you get it?
What's going on?
We're locked in.
Any casualties?
An inevitability, I suppose.  Nyssa was not among them, I trust.
Hey, you think I don't know what's at stake here?  We practically compromised our whole operation to save your puckered old ass!  And for what?
Nope.  Back then we did not.
So how long have you known Blade, anyway?
Get in. You’re leaving.
Pass.
Who dies first?
I can go to the police. I have blood samples back at the hospital. I can show them.
Figured they'd send someone after you. Thought I'd wait around and see who showed up.
But, he could've --
Graffiti --
So many of them -- I still can't believe they're real.
Is he sick?
I know. Take some of my blood.
This isn't human blood.
Please. You and the other Elders wouldn't know what to do with these texts if your lives depended on it.  Which, of course, they do.
I was wrong about you, Blade. You were never one of us. You're a traitor to your race.
On me, yes. On Blade, I'm not so sure --  The problem is, Blade didn't contract the vampire virus from a bite like I did. He was born with it. The irony is, I could probably cure every vampire but him.
--or incredibly fucking naive.
I was out hiking, camping the past two days--that's what did it--<u>I</u> killed it--
Look, this is not my field of expertise. You seem stabilized, but why take any chances? Let's keep you overnight and have the Staff obstetrician do a follow-up tomorrow.
No!
--I'm not staying here!
Down or off--you're giving me a migraine.
Guess they thought it was safe to put some up again.
What's she look like?
Druid Hill Park.
--the witch kills children--
--doesn't just pop out of thin air. It spins off of real events. At some point there <u>was</u> a Blair Witch--
--brother of Rustin Parr's maternal grandfather, somewhere after 1858--
I want to see the tapes.
What can I get you?
Why?
You're gonna owe me the rest of your life, bud.
--Christ, they find out I let you have it for the weekend--
My ass--you saw those four fucking baboons put 'em there!
I'm the ebay Boy, remember? I can't exactly afford that kind of equipment.
--which'd be about ten bucks--
You're a complete fucking idiot, aren't you?
Never would've guessed.
So where the hell am I going to sleep?
What?
No fucking.
What're you, crazy??
--yeah, a hand or something--
Too busy eating us?
Mi casa y su casa!
She would've had to have a key, anyway, to lock the deadbolt behind her.
You think it's possible the tree in the Parr foundation is the same one they tied Elly Kedward to?
It's <u>freezing</u>.
The moon trying to shoot down through all these trees--can make things funky--
Yeah. Me too.
--who?
What?
I'm not finished.
This isn't about us.
--what happened to the goddamn "Witch-watch??"
Why was <u>she</u> exempted, Nick?
Look at those marks--just like in the movie.
He'll never know.
Elly Kedward?
I think you closed the bar again. I'll have to go out.
--bullshit--
Jesus, you don't think I know that? You don't think I've tried? She won't fucking <u>go</u>-- she won't leave this place.
Check the monitor, she's <u>fine</u>.
--it's urgent!
Yes.
I'll tell your mother not to expect you at the funeral.
Meurice--
You can stay at my place, I'll drop you there.
...Ray?
Why didn't you get into bed?
Remy.
Tell him the channels, Dusty.
No.
Yeah.
Well... if you're not gonna fire me I might as well quit.
I didn't say that.  Well?
So, uh... this wouldn't interest you.
Yeah. Is it...
Just the ten thousand'll be fine.
...it's too damn risky.
This.
That's not the point.
Thanks Meurice.
Got a problem, Meurice?
Where was I?
Tuesday.
I sent a trunk home yesterday. This is all I have.
I've seen a few.
To your health, Frank.
What is this? What color is it?
Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you, but I've got to talk to you.
And that man came out with a third man - this well-dressed guy. here's the photo. I think a girl named Dorothy Vallens is in trouble with these people. I think Frank has taken her husband and her son.
I can't tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I can't say more.
Not yet.
Frank?
Frank. he didn't mean it. Leave him alone. come on. He didn't mean it.
Bull.
That oughta do it.
What do you want from me?
I . I don't know.
Nothing. Are you alright?
Don?
I made it go down the toilet.
Do you know?
Look.
Falling.
Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. you like me, huh?
Whatiya mean?
Do you want to do bad things?  Anything. anything.
You like to open me. don't you?
Okay. I know you've been scared. now you want to scare someone.
Does that scare you?
Beeeee careful.
Come on Dorothy.
Look, snap out of it, will ya?
Wait a minute. Wait. Whatiya want? For cryin' out loud!
Men are crazy. then they put their craziness into me. then it makes me crazy. then they aren't so crazy for awhile. then they put their craziness in me again.  . it's burning me. but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I love you?
Oh no.
Don?. Where is he?
Yeah. I guess I did.  What's going to happen to me?
No thanks. what does that mean?
I don't want to go.
Hey? . You like to walk.
What are you lookin' at?
Come on. I wancha to meet a frienda mine. Raymond, get enough beer for Ben too.
Okay Frank.
I'd like to talk to you about something.
Now, how are you going to do that?
Now. we'll walk over so there's no license plates and you give me at least three minutes. I can stall if it's more, but I need time to find a good window .alright?
Okay, I'm going ahead. Wait a minute, what's her name?
It'll be okay. I don't think you should wait out here though. I think you should go home. Can you drive this car?
Yeah. I mean. a little, . you know.
Yeah I guess so.  You're a neat girl.
Okay. okay.
You know, that cheese is practically all chemicals.
Go ahead.
Looks like they've got you strapped in pretty good.
Well. Okay.
It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him.
No. you're right.
No. No thank you.
He comes over to study.
Hey come here, you stole my girl, you bastard. I'm gonna kick your ass, right in front of your stupid house.
He what?
Yes.  Jack Stevens is already a very busy man.  Along with many others.  You shouldn't stay away so long.
I'm so glad you two could make it. Mirtha, look at you.  So beautiful.  You look like you're about to burst.
Blanca, por favor.
Mama, vos sos bien antigua.  Como lo va a matar con un picahielo.  Eso era en su tiempo, estamos casi ya en los ochenta. El lo va a meter un tiro, lo va a volar, le va a hechar un hijueputa carro encima.
This is it for me.
Just everything.  You.  California.  The beach.  This spot right here.  I feel like I belong here, you know?  It just feels right.
Are you kidding?
What?  You're not going to wait for me?
Whose cloths?  Your clothes?
You.  Your responsibility is over.  You do not fly.  You are not a pilot.  You are not a distributor.  You introduced us to Mr. Stevens and the use of his airplane.  That is all.  You make a percentage.  A generous one.  And you're lucky to get that.
I see.  How much?
No.
I don't know, Diego.  I've got a good thing going already.  Everybody smokes pot.  It's easy.  Cocaine is a rich man's drug.  It's too expensive.
Yes.  And a kilo of coca is smaller than a kilo of your precious marijuana. Everything is the same, George, except instead of thousands, you are making millions.
What is it, George?  Because I have to get home.  I've got a parole officer waiting for me.
And keep only forty-percent?  No thanks.
I'm married, George.  Me.  I can't believe it.  Can you believe I'm married, George?
I'm very angry with you, George.  Very angry.  You don't take me to California, but you take your bitch wife?  A woman? I understand you love her, but it was you and me who started this.  You and me.
What do you need my connection for, Diego?  What are you going to do with it?
Take it easy!  Everything's okay!
Estoy bien, okay?  Everything is alright.  There's no problem.  Okay? This never happened.  No one has to know anything about this.  Diego, I want you to calmly tell them where the fucking coke is.  Do it now.
No more brothers, Diego.
I did not.
In how long?  A week?
Yes, Barbara.  She was very pretty.
Un sapo?
Yes.  Money.  Which is what, George?
Family.
Sure.
Money.
I see.  I'm sorry about this, George. I'm not happy about this situation. It's bad.  You now know who your Brutus is.
You know why I'm here.  You know what I have to do.  I came here for permission. Out of respect, Pablo.  This is bullshit, he's making me look like a punk.
Life will take care of everybody. Diego, me, you.  It is the teacher.
Yeah, well, what are you gonna do?  You and me, Pablo?  Are we good?
What are you going to do?
No, it's good.  You have a family.  It's good if it makes you happy.  It's nice to have nice things.  Are you happy, son?
Figured what out?
Do I know you?
I don't think so.
There's a fucking cop behind us, Mirtha. Be cool, will ya.
I don't know.
Yeah.  Go out there, check it out, see what it's like.  I've got some stuff to do this week, but I'm thinking maybe Thursday.  Thursday after school.
You know I can't.  Mom will never let me go.
I swear.  On my life.
It's a four-man operation.  Two on the ground.  Two in the air.
Who's the co-pilot?
Sounds fine.  I'll need to meet everybody.
Listen, Americano, it is very nice to meet you, but maybe we are going too fast.  You take a little and then come back.
Not that far, only halfway.  You sure you know what you're doing?
Look around. I've put everything at your disposal. Go take a look with your own eyes.
And here?
The questions have already been asked. I would only like some precise answers, that's all ...
Second district ...
Third group. What's your assignment?
What's happened to you?
They're not paying me anything. They've already warned you twice; this is the last warning. Decide.
It's better to split up, to increase our chances. We must change hiding places, and change them continually ... In the meantime, we must make new contacts, replace our arrested brothers, reorganize our sections--
It's clear. They'll do everything possible to make it fail.
Why?
Why?
Here it is!  According to the old will Joanne Braslow was to inherit two hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
You did a good job, Charlie.
Cause?
Doctor McCurdy, what was the cause of death?
Yes -- those of Mr. Marsh and a thumb print of Miss Lawson's.
-- And if he were in the midst of making love while under the influence of cocaine?
What did they argue about?
You name it -- they argued about it. Mr. Marsh tried his best to keep her happy -- but it seemed that no matter what he did it was never enough for her.
No -- never.
Your Honor, Mr. Roston is an ex-lover of Miss Lawson's.
No questions.
Can you?
She planned this.  She wanted us to find the nasal spray.
She's innocent.
I've got work to do.
What's happening to you, Frank? You're acting like you're on trial here.  This has become personal to you.
I have.
How long were you Mr Marsh's personal secretary?
Did you talk about Miss Lawson?
About a year and half ago.
Yes.
For about one year.
I had bypass surgery.
She didn't.  She just left.
It's hard to resist a woman as beautiful as she is.
If you knew it was bad for you why did you do it?
I woke up the next morning and she was gone.
She was.
Did you ever see her again after that?
What did she say?
Did Mr. Marsh ever tell you that he had spoken to Miss Lawson about his illness?
--And is Miss Lawson a patient of yours?
What did you prescribe for her?
Miss Sellers, do you know Dr. Alan Paley?
No.
How do you know it was cocaine that Miss Lawson had in the bathroom?
Well, think about it.  Isn't it possible?
No.
Dristan nasal spray.
Isn't it true that you put the cocaine in the bottle?
No!  Why would I want to kill him?
Hi, Joe.
I think we're getting a little off the subject here.
Yes.
How?
Because -- it's beyond intellect. It's emotion.  It's passion.  It has to be experienced -- it can't be imagined.
Why not?
Because, I'm your attorney.  I shouldn't be going to your house.
Is it against the law?
Tell me about Doctor Paley?
Yeah.
You lied to me!
I just left Joanne Braslow.  She told me she saw you doing cocaine at Marsh's house!
I called you all weekend.  Where were you?
He was only doing what he thought was right.
So, sue me.  Things have changed.  I think you should go home -- and after you leave I see no reason for us to ever have contact again.
I'm not leaving without that tape.
I know what day it is!  Get off the phone.
Do it quickly, Mr. Dulaney.
The witness will answer the question.
You're on vacation, remember?  You're supposed to be relaxing.
No.
I don't know.
That's too bad.
Yes.
No, we just had lunch at the hotel with my brother and his new wife. She told me all the dirt. I forgot how interesting things can get around here. It was so good to see them. The last time we visited they were in Europe. He is doing so well. He ordered champagne. For lunch! I nearly died.
Well, I can help.
I do not need instructions from you to bathe!  I knew you'd do this! I knew I'd come all the way here and be shut out as usual! I came to be here for you! I didn't have to come!  Lord knows I was never much welcome in this house before. Apparently dead or alive, nothing's changed.
Lawyer here?
I remember a Mrs. Delaney but Mama told me years ago she died.
Robert! Jesus! I'll kill him.
Oh, he did not. He's such a nice guy.
Nice? He's trying to sleep with somebody's wife.
Not officially. Her and Steve Kendall were pinned at birth. But I was crazy about her. And for about three months, I managed to catch her during her "exploring" stage.
Was this during Betty?
Everything was during Betty. God we were so young. Why did we think we had to do it all so fast? I've never cheated on Betty. Not once we were married, I mean.
Carolyn!
What about me! I feel really weird. Like she cheated on me, not dad. Isn't that sick? I don't mean I wanted to sleep with her or anything but -- ya know -- being the only son. You're sort of made to feel like you're the prince of the kingdom, ya know? And in the back of your mind, you kind of think your mother doesn't need sex anymore because she has you.
No. What a tragedy. What happened?
What do you know about "the changes"?
Pretty country.
Maybe it's because I live here.
Uh-huh. Lived there till I was twenty or so and then moved to Chicago when I got married.
No, I don't mind. I'm not from here. I was born in Italy.
I'm so sorry about that. It was rude. I think I just got nervous for some reason.
Why? You uncorked a bottle. From what I can tell, I got here just in time. Any later and you'd have made the front page, running down Main Street naked, smoking Camels out of your butt.
What?
It's still a very sensitive memory for me.
I don't know if obsessions have reasons. I think that's why they're obsessions.
No. I wouldn't say that. National Geographic isn't exactly the hub of artistic inspiration. They like their wild life in focus and without any personal comment. I don't mind really. I'm not artist. I'd faced that a long time ago. It's the course of being well-adjusted. I'm too normal.
My children. And Richard didn't like my working.
I don't know. I've never thought about it... what was the most exciting place you've ever been to? Unless you're tired of talking about it.
When?
You sure you won't let me help you with those dishes?
Do you mind if I... ask you why you got divorced?
You must get lonely at times.
You really don't need anyone?
Not everybody's supposed to have a family.
I thought that's what we were doing -- asking questions.
No. I was just... No.
Oh. I guess you got the whole story.
I now know more about their affair than I remember about my marriage.  Francesca, the last thing I want to do is put you in any kind of situation that would... even though we know it's just -- I mean, it's nothing like that, but if anybody saw us or... 
But you don't mind.
What were you like when you were younger?
Yes, thanks.
Fine. More eggs or should we just fuck on the linoleum one last time?
You won't be made to feel! Period. You've carved out this little part for yourself in the world where you get to be a voyeur, a hermit and a lover whenever you feel like it and the rest of us are just supposed to feel so incredibly grateful for the brief time you've touched our lives! Well, go to hell! It isn't human not to feel lonely -- it isn't human not to afraid! You're a hypocrite and you're a phony!
Then he can move! People move!
What about us? What about me?
Francesca, listen to me. You think what's happened to us happens to just anybody? What we feel for each other? How much we feel? We're not even two separate people anymore. Some people search their whole lives for it and wind up alone -- most people don't even think it exists and you're going to tell me that giving it up is the right thing to do? That staying here alone in a marriage, alone in a town you hate, in a house you don't feel apart of anymore -- you're telling me that's the right thing to do!?
Robert. Please.  You don't understand -- no one does. When a woman makes the choice to marry, to have children -- in one way her life begins but in another way it stops. You build a life of details. You become a mother, a wife and you stop and stay steady so that your children can move. And when they leave they take your life of details with them. And then you're expected move again only you don't remember what moves you because no one has asked in so long. Not even yourself. You never in your life think that love like this can happen to you.
But now that you have it -
I'm going to be here a few more days. I'll be at the Inn. We have some time. Let's not say any more now.
I said to him Cary you're being ridiculous. You're more than half her age. He said no one had ever been that honest with him and he falls in love with me.
Franny?
What's her name?
Think for a second. Is there someplace she said she wanted to go?
About an hour ago.
Apparently just before her death.
Outta my way, boy.  Cinnabar?  I'm coming!
Why don't you hang on and I'll see if she's here.
Your father was his best friend.  He loved Jeremiah.  So he must hate him the most of all now.  He'll take his time. But even if it is too late.  If your father is dead.  It's not over.  The door has to be closed.
Hey, watcha doing with that dog?
Is it true?
The man said just to use my imagination.  Let's see...yeah, I get it.  Potential. I can see it now.  The first major urban theme park.  Village Ghetto land. Kinda like Legoland, but made entirely from broken glass, hypodermic needles and crack vials.  Totally E-ticket.
Ugh.  Muchos moscos, man.  This is too much.
Just some flies.
Tia ain't a chick.  She's family.  And don't forget it.
Is this Hell?
Dad, the man has been lying to us for a hundred years.  I mean, where is my forty acres and a mule?
Those 'fools' are my people.
Just try it.
Maybe I oughtta get there a little early. For good luck.
Left hand's the past.  Your right's the present.  And the future.  But it's not written in stone.  It's written in flesh and blood.  And flesh and blood will change.  See?  There's something here, a new line, right across your life line.
Must be my clothes line.  No?  How bout my phone line?
How did you get in here?
Aw that's easy.  I want my life back. Can you swing that, my brother?
I have to finish this for class.
I don't want you meeting around that house.  You stay away from those kids. And away from that dog.
...I've seen things.  In there.  Last night.  You did too.  Don't tell me you didn't.  You were crying like a baby.
You said the vision, the images.  They're just that.  Just pictures.  They can't hurt you.  That's what you always said.
All the more reason I should be here.
Way I figure, everything our parents tell us is part true and part total B.S.  And our whole job is figuring out for ourselves which is which.
We gotta jump!
You got the cash?
What are we doing down here?
Listen to me, boy.  I didn't work all my life to get out of this neighborhood for you to move right back in!
12-year olds.  They scare easy.  Anyway, he's gonna tip their stash.  Come with me.
Oh, no.  Please don't make me go by myself.  I'm scaaaaaaaaaared.
Goddamnit!  How many times I told you --
That's all we did, steal their ride.
Then how'd you hear it, fool?
And damp, too.  Let's not forget damp.
You gotta use your imagination.
You sure we oughta save him?  Why not just let see how safe his gates and walls keep him when his past comes calling?
There wasn't any draft.  That window was closed.
Whoa, whoa.  Come on, he's making too much noise.
You hear that, bitch?  Be quiet!
Glenlivet, right, Gino?
Open the case!
No, Gino!
We're family, Caesar.
Caesar, I'm serious.  This is too much.  I have to get out of here.
They just left, didn't they?
What?
So what?!  So fucking what?  Use your head, Violet.  The money is gone.  Gino is coming here to get it.  You think he's going to believe me if I tell him his piss-hole son stole it!  Is that what you think? I don't.  You know what I think?  I think I'm a dead man.  I'm one in the brain.  That's what I think!
But it could be anywhere.
Caesar, what are we going to do?
Stupid cunt!
They're all fine.  Just bruises and shit.
I want what's mine, half the money. We get rid of Mickey, no one else dies.  No one.  Say yes, I understand.
Fuck, this happened before.  It's this shitty ear.  Born with it.  The batteries wore out in my aid.  I'm sorry.
I'm going to make myself a drink, if that's okay?
You're helping Rajeev?
What?  How about a drink?
Are you okay, Violet?
Okay, sure, Mick.
No, Cease.  There was no answer.
I thought I heard someone knocking.
Actually, yeah, she was nervous about Gino coming, wanted everything to look right.  You know women, Mick.
Hello?
Who?
Oh, I'm sorry --
You're doing everything yourself?
Truck.
I knew it.
Do you know him?
I'm sorry, look, forget it.  I shouldn't have called...
Okay, one drink.
Why?
Caesar's Mafia, isn't he?
That's what I tell someone when I'm trying to get them in my bed.
I'm already in your bed.
Why?
Yeah.
And as you do, the bottle will slip from your hands.  -- and shatter against the hardwood floor.
I'm just asking, what if?
I still don't see how I'm going to get clean with the money in the apartment.  Everyone will think I did it.
Believes it!  Jesus, it's driving him crazy.  He wants to kill him.  I don't know, Corky, I don't know what he is going to do.  I'm getting nervous, really nervous.
Oh, Christ, I got to get out of here!
I was so afraid you ...
Done.  We go now.
Caesar wants me to stay.
I will never understand it, Mickey. You didn't even call the police.
I told you, the family doesn't want the police around.  We want to take care of it ourselves and we will. I'll find him.  I swear I will.
<u>This is an operations desk</u>.
No.  We can't risk it.
-- he went inside! --
Who are you?  Rome?  Paris?  Treadstone...both of us...I was warned but...
Yes, I'm...I'm looking for Mr. Jason Bourne.
There was an accident.  On the motorway.  Apparently, he was killed instantly.  Really, I'm terrible sorry to be the one to tell you this...
Who?  Who came?
His brother.  You know his brother?
It's very bad this.  Terrible sad. Such a young man.
Let me get you a new copy of the proposal.
It's a little late for that.
You have blood on your pants.
Listen to what you want.
I don't know.  I don't know who I am.
No.
-- which was okay for a while, I was okay with it...  But then -- there's all these other things -- all these other things I know how to do -- and this -- this stuff from the bank and...  I think something bad happened.
Where?
I should go.
I don't remember any of this.
Thanks for the ride.
Look, I don't know what's up there.
Nah...  With you, I mean, you'd probably just forget about me, right?
This is like a real apartment.  This is really yours?
See.  It's starting to come back, yeah?  You mind if I take a bath?
Marie, just --  -- just stay there! -- just --
He's dead isn't he?
He went out the window -- why? -- why would someone do that?
And where is he now?  You believe what you want, but I'm telling you the truth -- I never would have brought you here if I thought it was dangerous.
xxxxxx
Can I help you?
I said, someone came last night --  Look, this isn't a carnival -- people call and they make an appointment and they follow the rules -- everyone signs in and out -- this is a serious place -- serious work -- it's not just to come in whenever you like --
So get the hell out of here.
-- this is serious business down here and we cannot have people coming and going --
What the hell're you talking about?
All the papers -- all the papers they asked for -- I brought all the papers --
What's that?
What?
Where am I?
...elephoned sir.
Trouble with your air-conditioning.
...ixed itself.
Machines don't fix themselves.
... fix themselves.
What have you got there?
Tuttle! ... mumble!  You've had that scab Tuttle here, haven't you?
Oh yeh? Where'd you get this from eh  out yer nostril?
...ven't you?
Sign the form so we can get to it.
Sam, what are we going to do with you? Can you hear me, Sam?
Yes, well, from the Department's point of view you're certainly a bit of an own goal, but ...
Please, I've got to find Jill.
Yes, it's all a bit confusing but, it seems she was killed resisting arrest.
Sam!
Well, since you disappeared up the ladder of Information Retrieval ... I don't expect to see you slumming in Records - what's the problem?
You sound worried.
What's the matter?
Sorry. Nothing.  See you - I'm going to be late.
Even later.
Hello, Jack!
For my sins. Are you settling in alright?
No, no, I don't. I'm just beginning Honestly. Sorry, carry on.
You killed him?
What I've got to do now is pick up Tuttle, interrogate him at the same voltage as Buttle, to the same meter reading to the last penny, and juggle the books in electrical banking.
What has Tuttle done?
Er ... no.
{baffled) I don't follow you.
You mean you're going to invite her in so that she can spill the beans inside the department?
Well, I'd better get out there and try to get to her before security does. Let me borrow her dossier for a while.
Do you know what you're doing.
You stupid bastard!
If you say so.
Don't litter my cab!
No, really.
No. Please. They're going to arrest you.
Let go! We've got to stop!
We? Don't blame me!
Shit! The house is on fire!
Please, Jill ... I love you.
I vas just trying to help. I decided to trust you. Maybe I was wrong. Whose side are you on really? Who are your friends? Who was the man who gave you the parcel? What's in it? It's the only thing you saved from the lorry .... It must he something very special.
I saved you from the lorry and you're not very special.
Don't you like parties?
Oh, good!
Tuttle?
He is dead.
What?
I've go to accept that promotion to get behind this, haven't I?
Ah.  Would you mind if I borrowed your computer console?
What?  Look, let me use the console for a few minutes.
My mother said it would be all right.
Hello, Spiro. Merry Christmas.
You remember Samuel, my son.
Numero une, crevettes à la mayonaaise. 
Mr Helpmann was very close to your poor father. He was very close to me. Still is. He'll take you under his wing at Information Retrieval. You'll like it when you get there.
My husband's dead, isn't he?
There was a slight complication. Dr. Chapman says it often happens with a delicate skin like mine. Nothing to worry about. He's promised me I'll have these bandages off in a ...
Actually, there's someone I want to meet ...
I think that'll hold it.  Hello Shirley. Just helping someone tie up a Christmas present. How are you?
Numero huit, braised veal in wine sauce. 
That's all right Ida ... it's just that he's such an artist. To him, cutting is so crude ... so primitive.
Monsieur. Quel numero.
It's all right, Terry, it's all right, everything's all right.
They're a bit overworked these days. Luckily I intercepted your call.
I'm sick. That's what I've been telling you.
I feel for you, but we got an emergency here. It's a weekend of full moons.  Everyone's called in sick. Larry, Veeber, Stanley too. We need bodies out there. I had to put Marcus on Twelve Young. You know he's not supposed to work two nights in a row.
You're late, Pierce. I know, but I can't fire you. I've got nobody to work sixteen XRay with Walls.
She say she in great pain.
Es impossible.
He looks like a cop.
Frank, take it easy. what happened?
I should be going. I just quit.
So, Frank, am I going to live?
Dead.
No.
All right, all right, he's been snorting that Red Death stuff. Been going for four days.
See, I can't do it. I came out of the desert.
Oh man, do you mean that?  Thank you man, thank you. How?
I'm not so sure. My father and I haven't spoken in three years. When my brother called to say my father was having a heart attack, that he'd locked himself in the bathroom, all the way going over I was thinking how I was gonna tell him what a bastard he was. Then when I got up the stairs and we moved him onto the bed, I thought of all these other things I wanted to say.
It's okay. They're prescription.  Works better with a little whiskey.
Yes.
My father's in a coma, now my mother's going crazy. It's like she's in a trance.
Yes?
I was going nuts in that waiting room so I came back to check on my mom.
He's better, though, right?
I grew up on Elizabeth. I went to Blessed Sacrament.
How long you been doing this?
Excuse me. You seemed like you were in trouble.
We can still go back. I'll walk you home. You sleep a couple of hours, watch some TV, take a bath.
Too bad. He called me up today, can you believe that? I don't know how he got my number. He asks me do I want to come over and see him, I tell him I'd rather go to a leper colony. He says there's a new gang that wants to kill him, take over the business. I told him I hope he's right. That they kill him. That's what I told him.
Can I bring you something back to eat--a falafal, some pizza?
Who is it?
He's not dead. It's a heroin overdose. Break out the Narcon.
I ever tell you about the time years ago I was on this ledge uptown, trying to talk this psycho inside?
Who's that?
Rule number one: Don't get involved with patients. Rule number two: Don't get involved with patient's daughters. You understand?
Backup?
Where you going?
That guy I brought in yesterday, post-cardiac arrest. He's gone.
Burke. You won't believe it. He's showing cognitive signs. He started with spontaneous respiration, now he's fighting to pull out the tube. Had to sedate him. He's in a CAT scan. I'm giving him every test I can: thromboytics, steroids, nitrodrips, heparin.
What do you do, just have someone follow him around with a defribilator?
Our mission is coffee, Tom. A shot of the bull, Puerto Rican espresso.
Tom, where are the Band-aids? This is an ambulance, isn't it?
Get this, Frank--we got two patients. Number one, the scarecrow outside. Number two misses the railing but breaks both legs on the balcony, then throws himself through a glass window, heads to the bedroom, where he's now passed out.
He's crazy. He can't help it.
If he sees me, he'll run, so I'll get out here. You start talking to him about baseball or something while I sneak around behind and get down and you push him. When he falls we get him.
That's ridiculous.
Do it!
Oh yeah, you don't eat food.
I eat. I just haven't had coffee yet.
Turn it off.
Faster! God!
I'm not feeling very well, Larry. I say we go back to the hospital and call it a night.
You have no sick time, Frank. No time of any kind. Everyone knows that.
Jesus, Tom Walls, that crazy motherfucker.
Look, Frank, when I say don't answer it, that means answer it.  You can do that for me at least.  Three Zebra.
I'm not buying into any of that.  I have a load to learn.  I'm not going to act as if...
Yes.
You're feeling good, aren't you?
I'm starting to... We may do the capitols of the states.
What?
You were smokin' toward the end there.
It is.  Yes -- that's where they had Rorish, for God's sake, before they made him anchor.  I can't stand it -- they're grooming you for it all and you don't even know it.
This story they won't cover.  And if the network doesn't cover it -- it must not be important so why worry.
You know what I...
Ravenous homosexual.
Okay.  Let's do me.
Good night.
Nine seconds.
If we don't get to their camp soon, we won't be able to tape the supplies coming in.
I figured out exactly why it is I'm so hung up on getting a chance at weekend anchor...It's because if I do that well, they'll pay me more, treat me great and my life will be better.  That's why.
You know you've had a strange day... I'd sleep on all these things you've been thinking.
Aaah --  -- ello.  You sure they said the management meeting?  They want me to be at the management meeting.
I read about it -- that's how you can make sure you don't put on too much perfume...
You didn't see it or speak to anybody?
Define your terms.
People phoned in.
What?
Yes, I guess.  Yes.
Okay, that's very easy.  Five, six years from now I'll be in town to collect an award representing the surge in foreign coverage by local stations.
I'll be walking with my wife and two children -- we'll bump into you on the street, my youngest son will say something and I'll tell him...  ...it's not nice to make fun of single, fat ladies.
I'll put him in the low corner of the frame -- good.
Wait.  Bullshit me a little...I'm beginning to appreciate it.
I'm no suggesting the worst will happen...but someone with your brilliance gets nibbles about other jobs and maybe, the next time that happens, down the road -- you should look into it.
Ah, damn -- the fucking jerks -- My, God.  They want to fire me.
All this business of war -- do you get scared?
Norman Rockwell's 'Homecoming.'
This is a brutal layoff...And all because they couldn't program Wednesdays.
You don't have time.  Not a chance.
What are you dressed up for?  Oh, that's right -- because the Evening News is here this week.
We could...
Good.  He's on the world's longest ego trip, let him take it alone.
Ernie, they're calling from work.
Tell me I'm on the way in.
...am starting to get jealous. I read in the newspapers about the Italian strike and riots in Milan.  I hope you weren't...
I just have two more pen pals and then I'm done.
As long as that's your only problem you're...
Oh my.  I see you studying so hard, Tom.  What do you think the problem is?
Thank you.  They hated me.  I don't hate them.
I didn't even have the chance to get really good at sports.  I wasn't bad. I thought I was starting to do interesting features but hockey is big at the station and...
What about the obvious remedy? Reversing things.  Maybe getting a job on a newspaper.
I'm sorry if I was in the way.  It was totally impressive.  Great piece.
I can't believe I'm really here.  No kidding.  If you're through work now --
'Really a lot appreciate it...'
It's much too soon for you to have this kind of buzz around you.
No.  Were you going to you?
Maybe I'll get off work.  I'd like to go.
You're not going to take off on me, are you?
At least kiss me when you do that.
Because you're nuts.
It's not that it's hard.  I just want you to give me a minute to catch up.
Hi.  It's me.
I can't get away just yet.  I'm at Aaron's.
Hi, again.  Sorry about...
That it would be a treat to make someone like you feel better... He gets like that sometimes.
Jesus, if you're glib about this I'm going to lose it.  I was up all night and...
That's not going to be the way we say good-bye.  Even though I think what you did was rotten -- it's not all impersonal.  You mean something to me.
I don't wan to discuss work.
I knew what you meant.
A picnic?
Well, we should talk.  You going to have time for  dinner?  I'd like you to meet Lila.
I sure know that feeling.  Terrific work today.
Well I'm touched.  You're serious, aren't you?
It's called spontaneity, Leonard. Get with the program.
How did you ever find it all in yourself, Walter?
Gee..twenty five dollars for something I made!
Yes Walter.
Well that was for your sculpture of the girl.  Your nude in the chair.
Hi Walter...
I've never seen anyone so... squeamish.  Well, what's your opinion, Leonard?
Don't ask.
That's the idea, Walter.  It's the only way to gain recognition. All the big art critics and art dealers would be there, it would be an event.
Abstract?  With his talent for realism?
Would you pose for me for free?
I wonder what his deal is.
Now what kind of statue was that?
Man if you want to be a legit artist you have to do nudes, nudes, nudes...
Man this is heavy!
Man, why do you suppose Walter wants to get her alone?  You suppose he could be physically attracted to her?
I was just looking at Carla's picture.
Well that's not what I pay you for, now is it?
I didn't mean to.
Alright, I'll tell you what.  I'll put it in the corner of the alcove. If it sells, we'll split it fifty- fifty.  How's that?
H-have a seat?
Hiya Carla.
Hello Leonard!  Beautiful morning, isn't it?
Maxwell!  He's behind all this with all his stupid blowhard poetry!  Listen, you've got to stop right away!  I'm beginning to feel responsible!
I'm trying to reach Lieutenant Beldere...
Listen to me...I don't want to lose this piece -
I'm holding for Lieutenant Beldere!
I also saw the girl give you this.
But I got a feeling you're gonna cooperate with me.  Yessir, I think you and me are gonna be real good friends.  Why don't you tell me about your connection.
I got you cold, pal.  Make it easy for yourself, use your head.
Don't give me a hard time Walter! You don't want to get me mad!  You're coming with me!
Maxwell.
And what project looms on the horizon, Walter?
No thanks.  Sounds good though.
It's like...you've turned on.
Gee.  Thanks.
If you were my son...why don't you let me fix you a nice hot bowl of soup, it won't take but a minute.
What's all the noise in here!
Don't tell me I didn't hear a racket!  I'm an older woman and I don't need to be upset and disturbed in this manner!
I had him in my grasp.
I don't know.  But the boy, he couldn't kill them.
... And they're having some memorial service or something tomorrow.  You going?
Nice game.
You're the guys from the movie!
Rich bitches.  They're a plague. They've gotta be stopped.
Wait a minute.  What's wrong with you, man?
No offense, man, but I think you're on something nasty.  Why don't you just go and cool out and I'll see you in the morning or something.
You don't mean, like, a cheerleader?
Are there any good sicknesses that aren't too depressing?
Do you know what time it is?
What show is this?
I just want to see the basketball scores.  It's important.
I can take care of myself, Jeffrey.
I don't understand.
You weren't home.  Like always.
This?  This is you only weapon? Your puny faith?
Do you do this kind of thing a lot? I mean, is this like a hobby?
They were vampires, weren't they?
Thanks.  Tomorrow morning, I'm on a bus.  I'm gone.
It's weird.  I went back to my old grade school once, to the playground -- I used to hang out there all the time, playing on the swings and stuff... I went back and it was so tiny, the whole place.  I couldn't even fit on the swings.  Everything just looked so small.  I'm sorry.  I'm babbling.
I think I'll just hang out here. Make sure the sun comes up and everything.
I didn't expect to see you.
I really can't.  Besides, it's pretty interesting.
You're weird and I'm afraid of you. Seriously, Cassandra, there's a lot cooler things you could be doing than your homework.
I don't see why we have to invite everyone.
I'm glad you guys are here.  It's good to see you.
Yeah, whoops I came.
Wait!
You don't understand.  You have been chosen.
Does Elvis talk to you?  Tell you to do things?  Do you see spots?
I can't believe I'm doing this.  I can't believe I'm in a graveyard with a strange man hunting for vampires on a school night.
What, um...  What do we do?
In a way, yes.  Your fate is inexorably connected to them.
Well, everybody says... it's just kind of dorky.  I mean, have you ever seen a gymnast's legs?  They're like --  -- the mighty oak.  It's not a look.
Here?
Oh, several.  Lucretia Borgia, Joseph Mengele, Franklin Pangborn... are any of those names familiar?
If I say 'no' does that make me a bad person?
They were vampires?
Same one.
He was slow.  Very simple.  They won't all be that easy.
You are such a wet.
A what?
It isn't important.
Make time, okay?  You're the one who told me to act normal.  I've missed three practices already.  If I'm not there for the Barber game tomorrow everyone's gonna talk.
I'm pretty much learning not to accept anything anymore.  Come on, Merrick.  Football.  Afterwards we can kill and kill until there is nothing left.
So, is Jeffrey really spending the night at your house?
My parents have money...
Omniplex?
Wit-tay.
I'm sorry.  I'm Pike.  This is Benny.
Smell of booze much.
It's amazing what you can do with a parachute and some starch.
I didn't say "Crash".  I said Nuke.
I want you to wear these on the road trip when you pitch.
Good.  Total exhaustion can be spiritually fabulous.  Let's play catch.
This in ridiculous.  I'm a pro.
I can't keep up with you.  First you say sex is gonna make me a better pitcher--now no sex is gonna do it?!
I'm yours.
Breathing through your pingala always works, honey--
Just till I lose.
I'll tuck you in.
I know what it is.
I did.
He said if I gave in to you I'd start losing again.
I gotta leave first thing in the morning.
That's great!
After 12 years in the minor leagues, I don't tryout.  Besides-- I don't believe in, Quantum Physics when it comes to matters of the heart...or loins.
See my hips?
Yep.
I'm committed to Nuke for the season.  You had your chance the other night.
What'you see in that guy--he's dim, pretty boy.  a young, wild,
Despite my love of weird metaphysics and my rejection of most Judao-Christian ethics, I am, within the framework of a baseball season, monogamous.
Well, Annie, your place or mine?
I'm ready for a complicated man.
Why baseball?
I crossed the street--it was the New York Yankees spring training field--tok, tok, tok, was the sound of a ball hitting a bat-- and I sat in the warm bleachers to think about my mother...  And I saw him.
What happened?
Salem, Massachusetts?  Where all the witches were?
We were worried that Ebby might get involved with the wrong crowd in professional baseball--we're so pleased, he met a Christian woman.
Thanks for the note--you're right, I wasn't bending my back.
Sweetie, have you ever heard of Walt Whitman?
Who's he play for?
Well, he sort of pitches for the Cosmic All-Stars.
What's that?
Yes.  A switch hitting witch. Very common in Puerto Rico.
Don't bump me.
Did you call me a cocksucker?
Call me a cocksucker and you're outta here!
How?
You're through with one night stands?!  What do you want?
What?
Hey, I'm cruisin', man--what're you doing out here?!
I want you to throw this one at the bat rack.
Why?!  I'm finally throwin' the damn thing where I want to.
Of course.  That's the point.  "I'm just happy to be here and hope I can help the ballclub."
What's wrong?
I'll take you back to the hotel.
Good.  Good.  That's terrific...
Who you calling a "boy"?
He's got a million dollar arm and a five cent head.
Jesus--what's got into Nuke?
Nuke's overthrowing tonight, he don't look loose.  Anything bothering him?
What the hell's going on out there?
Well, I'd rather not say.
Look at yours.
...was gonna stop what came up next at the casino.
I'm a little in shock, quite frankly...
Mr Rothstein is being very typical to this point.
You were wandering around.
You know damn well I was at that dinner, and you swore to me that I would have a fair hearing at that dinner! Did you not?! Did you not?!  Well, tell me I was at least at the dinner! A-allow me that much.  Give me that much at least!
This is a very auspicious occasion.
On behalf of the Teamsters' Pension Fund, it is my pleasure to present to you . . .
But what happens when they do find out?
No, it's - it'll just be a couple of minutes. We got other things to do too, you know. He'll hurry her up. How's everything else besides this?
Hello.
Hello.
Lester...
I'm gonna get a knife and cut you loose, honey, I'll -
Where the hell did you learn how to deal? 
Eight.
Be careful. Gaming agents are all over the place.
Well, it wasn't long before what I was afraid was gonna happen, happened. Nicky managed to get himself banned from every casino in Las Vegas, and from then on, I couldn't be seen talkin' to him anywhere in Vegas, or even near it.
Motherfucker.  Unsavory fuckin'... Is there any way around this?
Yeah, Nicky loved restaurants. He was a real restaurant buff. And over the years, he always made money with them.
No, no it's okay.
...very difficult to get in.
That's all taken out of context. Okay.
You lost your control.
You know, I didn't want to bring this up, but you have treating a lot of people with a lot of disrespect. Even your own wife.
My wife?
The point is that she's upset. She's - and you got a fuckin' problem.
Hey, she came to talk...
Okay?
I see you, you motherfuckers.
What - what, Caesar's?
...hundred yards further down the road.
I didn't do anything. I mean, I didn't order you or anybody...  I only told Andy Stone that you had a lot of heat on you, and that was a problem.
Yeah, I said I - let the bullshit blow over for a while so I can run the casino. Anything goes wrong with the casino, it's my ass. It's not yours, it's my ass.
You know I get calls from back home every fuckin' day?!  They think you went batshit!
I'm only on TV because I gotta be able to hang around the casino. You understand that. You know that. Come on.
Your fuckin' ass! You could have had the food and beverage job without goin' on television!  You wanted to go on TV.
Oh, sure. Now you want to blame your fuckin' license on me, is that it?
What are you doin'? You gotta get out of here!
She didn't know who to turn to.  She... she didn't know where to turn. She was tryin' to save your marriage.
Well, that's why they paid so well.
Well, it's a little too early. I'd say Thursday would be good. I'll know by then. Is that all right?
...as soon as Andy got back home, Nicky heard about our talk in the car.
Never mind the 'sir'. Never mind the 'sir'.
Why is she eight pounds over?
...trying to offer you the respect that your...
'Mr Rothstein' is good enough.
That's right. She will get fired. In fact, I want you to send her back to Paris.
I hired an old casino pal, Billy Sherbert, as my manager and I went to work.
This woman's an institution.
You know a lot of happily married people, Sam? 'Cause I don't.
Uh-huh.
You're kidding? My God. What is it?
Need a little help with that, Mr Collins?
Hi. Nice to see you.
But as much as they loved her...
No.
Huh?
Okay.
Yes, I - yes, I do.
Do you... I mean... I don't think she should go by herself.
I under-understand that. I-I know I fucked up.
It's, uh, it's under twenty-five.
Okay?
He needed some clothes.
Mm-hm.
First of all, he's not gonna wear f- thousand-dollar suits. But let's say he did, which he won't. How you gonna get fitted for twenty-five suits in three days?  I, um, I mean, how could you get fitted that fast? I can't get fitted that fast, and I pay twice as much.
Yeah.
I'm just tryin' to figure it out.
Stop! You aren't getting rid of me with one fuckin' suitcase!
What'd you have?
I mean, she was asleep. I was going to be right back before she even woke up.
I just want the key to my jewelry, and I want you to let me go.
I am not!
...and hypocrisy.
Loose machines are right back over there.
What about the progressives with the high jackpots? Where are they? These machines are hidden.
I do understand that. I'll get right on it. And thank you.
Well, it's a casino. People gotta win sometimes.
You - Wait! You didn't see that you were being set up on the second win?
I ju- Well, it's a nice pen. I just didn't know whose it was. I thought it was yours. I didn't want it to get lost.
A couple of guys, I owe them. So, that's what I did. I gave 'em the money.  That's what I did.
You gotta go back there and talk to that guy.
Well, I've been busy. 
Hey.
It's instinctive, you know.
Forget about it, Nick. Don't let it bother you.
I think, you know, maybe he went across the street or somewhere else or somethin'. I don't know.
Stay out of the way!
For what?
...I want all the names of all the other people he had with him. And I don't care what you have to do to him to get 'em. You understand?
No problem.
Mm, you want to steal it? 
I do.
Oh, come on.
You just relax. Nobody's killin' anybody, do you hear?
I mean, listen, two people don't get along, at some point you gotta call it... I mean, it's none of my business, but I ... I think that's what you gotta do. You gotta take it somewhere -
Let me think about that.
Is that what you want?
What did I tell you? Supposing he goes back home and makes a fuckin' beef?  I gotta know exactly what you said. Tell me what you said to him.
Ah, you fuck! You're such a fuckin' asshole!
I don't need you! I have my own fuckin' money!
What money?  Look at this stack of chips. Don't give me that shit. I want my end.
Get lost?
Bub-ut, baby, do you know that I love you too?
...all the luck in the world.
What does that mean? No, I know that look. What does that mean?
We'll go later.
You're not gonna drive. Don't even think you're gonna drive.
God, I'm telling you, they're out!
Wow.
Yeah, but they're complaining.
Let's get out of here.
You know what I want you to do? Get a couple of guys to dig a hole in the desert, then let 'em show you where it's at.
Angelo and Buster.
And you make it disappear, you know what I mean?
Don't know.
Frankie!
Tony.
All right, yeah. You got that thing for me?
No, I want to have this marked, Mr. -
Denying?
I'm sorry.
All right, take it easy now, take it easy.
Hi.

You say that like an amnesia victim.
But of course you are. Dinner at Eight.  Wouldn't miss it.
What little boy doesn't...  My God...it's, it's...Catwoman.
I got home fine. How's the "warehouse."
This ring belonged to my sister. I'd love for you to...
In many ways, that obnoxious creep Cactus was the worst one of all. He got off on giving out pain...
I thought you said you weren't a very good liar.
Selina Kyle...lovely person.
Selina, are you okay?
You're kidding.
You're right, I wasn't looking to fall in love with a casino worker. I'd given up trying to find anyone. But there was a fire in your eyes that cut right through the air conditioning and through the coldness of my heart.
We're waiting.
Hey, speaking of Wrong Place, Wrong Time.  Lewis Lane to the rescue!
Winning.
What do you want from me?
Pass!
You might be right, but Fun is overrated.  I need something real.
What a "drag."
God-damn..
Sorry man, I didn't mean that personally...
Ah, did you hear that?  Spooky loved you...
Car wash, Captain?
I hate it when you get like this. This Catwoman is becoming an obsession. I say we call it a night. Tomorrow is a big day for us...
What if I were to say "Your Wife"-- as in does she know of your touching mentor-student relationship with the post-Bicentennial babe working the roulette wheel?
I am. Dinner with Brock Leviathan...
What?
Lose the smile, Mr. Good Reflexes. We were having a pretty okay time the other night--good food, good conversation--some Catwomen show up and it's "You need cab fare?; I got to go to my Hideout--Oh, I'm sorry, I mean "warehouse."
Have you seen the Oasisburg Police? They drive golf carts with little red sirens.
Is every single thing out of your mouth since your "accident" have to be a monotone mumble of cheap sarcasm?
Mom?  Oh Mom, I messed up...
I hate it when you let your hair just hang like that...you have such pretty eyes...
Do you always listen to what your mother says?  Selina. Something you choose your life. Sometimes your life chooses you.  Save the day..
You seem sad, Spooky.
Was someone in an accident?
Have you got to tell her your life story?
I am not!  Fuck you!  Theo's a genius.
No reason to kill innocent bystanders.  Shit.  I can't hardly move my neck.
Can you make him stop!
Put those away.  We can't have marks on his wrists.
You never miss a trick.
That was definitely out of line and totally unprovoked.  I heard you were a hitter.
What do you mean tip the cops?  Is the man a lunatic or what?
And stop with the directions.
I improved on the fucking original.
Lose the hardware now.
Nels?
Will you let me explain!
Lady, try making some sense.
They gave me pills to make me sleep.  They didn't realize how much Seconal I'm used to -- that I'd have so much tolerance --
Oh won't I?
One of them <u>is</u> a cop.
What makes you say that?
Let me call the school -- tell them not to let her go.
"Theo?"
Even if I got there first she wouldn't go with me.
Why isn't anyone answering me?
I don't know.  I hung up on somebody else a long time ago, and later on I wished I hadn't of.
Hey drop it, okay?
And that was the end of it?
I suppose if you're a struggling artist you need a patron.
Lady, you don't have to keep up a running commentary.
That makes two of us.
The front door slammed.  Someone went out.  There's a different car starting.
Theo, I want you to know, you're probably the most decent man I've ever met.
Yes?  Yes?
Now you're going to do just what I tell you to.  No discussion.  No hesitation.
Yes sir.
Why are you telling him that.  Are you crazy?
Plus they'll remember you going after his daughter at school.
Tell them I'm keeping what's left. I earned it.  I probably killed some poor bastard for it.
We might hit a bump and the gun might go off.  Ever see that Tarantino movie -- where Travolta blew that guy away in the back seat -- purely by accident?
You were at the Emerald that night?
Only in the leg or the thigh. You'd live but you just wouldn't wear shorts.
Yes I would.  Not kill you.  But blow off a few toes, absolutely. I'm entitled to that as retribution.  It'll help you to remember me in years to come -- every time you put on stockings. They must have prosthetic toes by now -- with little nails on them you can polish --
Stop talking like that!
Wonderful feeling of security knowing your adversaries are both crippled and unarmed.
Developer ran out of money years back.  I'd hate to think about what's living in there.
Maybe your friends already accomplished that chore for us.
Five ... six.
Didn't we play this scene before?
You're making it too easy.
A large stretch of empty space with no place to hide.  Temescal Canyon parking lot.
We don't see you.
I'm three quarters of the way up the lot behind the concession stand.
I don't want you within two hundred feet.  Park down by the lifeguard station.  Nobody gets out.
You'll see her.
Then just wait.  I'm counting this all out and deducting my share. While I'm at it you can be getting that tape off the lady.  And her little girl.
It's in the process.
Thanks for the sound advice.  Now ask the woman to get out of the van and walk over here.  Alone.
You pull up -- collect your first installment.  Then you let the daughter go.  When she reaches me, I'll dump out another third.  Same action.  I back up again -- you pull forward.  Satisfy yourself it's there.  Then we do it one last time.  The final exchange. And we go our separate ways.
Are you trying to panic the women?
Seems like it.
Call me "Nels."
Okay Nels, you can always keep what you've got and haul ass leaving the lovely lady for me to worry about.  I'll bet she can be friendly when it's in her best interests.
From what I can see you're a pretty fair wheelman.  There's a hairpin coming up -- that's the place for it. The cops'll plow right into you.
And I end up in a fucking neck brace for life!
Intelligent question, Nels.  I believe she had plans for both our bodies to be found in close proximity.
Not without the name of the contact who can discount the bonds.  I may need to pry that information out of her.  What do you stand to gain?
We're gonna get there first.
Probably as close to the Getty as I'll ever come.  Unless you care to be my "patron," Nels.  You wouldn't be the first successful thief to become a patron of the arts.
In your dreams.
The 405 is coming up.
So can we consider you a regular, sir?
So let's call this the usual.
Then why doesn't she?
He's still looking, Col.
You fucking promised.
And what's it like?
Not me.
Now's the time you're meant to do something, isn't it?
Make a pass or something. Isn't that the way it goes?
Piss off, Dave!
He was different.
As different as it's possible to be.
Drink.
What you thinking of, hon?
Tell him to stop messing Dil around --
Tell him it hurt --
You think that's wise?
So I'm sorry.
Know what, honey?
Don't be cruel.
She from Scotland too?
You could say that.
I'm going home!
More endearments.
What would you do for me?
Say it again.
Dil!!!
You've got to go now, Dil --
The Metro.
Fergus. Fergus my love, light of my life - -
Do you now.
We've got some plans here. And we'll need a Mister Nobody to execute them.
Och, you do, Fergie.
And what happens then?
And what if you don't?
You'll have minimal contact with the prisoner, do you hear me?
And do you know why?
Why do you want to do that for?
He's at home.
Who is he?
Five ten. Brown eyes. But you're no pinup.
Well, I could say the same about you.
Why can't we?
And you know the funny thing?
What?
She'd be anyone's type.
So what were you fucking around for, then?
Ever see hurling?
Doesn't matter where.
Oh, yeah.
It's as simple as that?
I didn't.
She can't help it.
What?
Go to Millie's Hair Salon in Spitalfields. Take her to the Metro for a margarita. Don't have to tell her who you are. Just tell her Jody was thinking --
And the scorpion. No. Tell me anything.
When I was a child...
Cricket's in the halfpenny place.
Used to run the mile, you know -- four times round the cricket pitch -- what was that game called?
Never pissed holding a girl's hand, Jude.
Have you no feelings, woman?
You're crazy. Don't let him, Peter.
You know what I mean -- the envelope with the stamps. I want it.
It's simple. I like what I do -- I enjoy doing it. There aren't many men who love their work as much as I do. Look around some time.
I could eat a horse.
Don't you dare to be civil with me! All this time you were leading me on --
It's a toss-up, I can tell you that.
Can you remember anything at all?
Reggie -- why won't you listen?
The truth, now -- was it my hide -- or the stamps?
I'm sorry -- my secretary must have gone to lunch. You are -- ?
Central Intelligence Agency -- C.I.A.
We? You mean you're --?
Agent.
What's all this got to do with me, Mr. Bartholomew?
Gladly, only I don't know what you want! You haven't told me.
Or a safe deposit key, a certified check, a baggage claim -- you look for it, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm quite sure you'll find it.
What did you want to see me about, Mr. Bartholomew?
I wouldn't advise that, Mrs. Lampert. You'd better consider what happened to your husband when he tried to leave. Those men won't be very far away -- no matter where you go. In fact, I don't even see any point in your changing hotels. Please help us, Mrs. Lampert. Your government is counting on you.
Maybe he really is Dyle. He could still be alive.
Me? Why me?
Go ahead, Mr. Bartholomew -- I'm listening.
Who asked you to get stuck with any of them?
Oh.
Supposing I did have it -- which I don't -- do you really think I'd hand it over?
Why you lied to me.
I met a man with sharp nails.
Your passport! What kind of a proof is that?
There must be some way.
Serious. When a man gets to be my age that's the last word he ever wants to hear. I don't want to be serious -- and I especially don't want you to be.
Cutting it out.
The phone's ringing --
That sounds like their problem.
Lord, I forgot all about it -- Sylvie works late Tuesday nights -- she always leaves him with me. They wouldn't do anything to a little boy, would they?
What -- like Scobie?
I usually sing a medley of old favorites when I bathe -- any requests?
Shut the door!
Reggie -- you haven't spoken a word in twenty minutes.
I don't understand you at all -- one minute you're chasing me around the shower room and the next you're accusing me of murder.
Fiction or non-fiction?
Why don't you shut up!
The man's the same, even if the name isn't.
Yes.
And the last one?
It doesn't belong to you, Mrs. Lampert -- you do know that, don't you?
You loved him?
One wallet containing four thousand francs -- one agenda --  -- his last notation was made yesterday -- Thursday --  "Five p.m. -- Jardin des Champs- Elysées"  Why there?
If you will sign this list you may take the things with you.
Why, do you think we're going to?
I'm not sure I --
That wasn't a proposal -- I was just curious.
What are you doing here?
What was all that?
Stop bullying me. Everybody's bullying me.
You said this afternoon that your husband was mixed up in something.
What was it?
What was what?
We're here.
Nothing. Good night.
Please help me, Peter -- you're the only one I can trust.
Yes -- that's right.
What'd he say?
Didn't Charles have any friends?
What's the matter, chérie?
We took all the chances. The money belongs to us, not him!
This ain't no game, Miz Lampert.
Ok not your imports. All your other CDS and your K2 snowboard.
One more time.
If I'd gone public with this yesterday Annette Michaels might be alive today.
Focus on the present. You always want to change the past. Let's figure out what you are going to tell the parents today, not what you should told them yesterday.
It's almost ten o'clock.
Daddy you scared me!
No. Those two were together before Kenny and I started hanging out and that's over, what, God a year now.
Ok.
I thought you'd be pleased.
It was a she.
Are you sure?
It can't be.
You found her?
As bizarre as it may sound, seems someone is planning to have a big party tonight.
Should we close down any eruption?
Well?
Of what?
A bullet to the right cerebellum.
No, you couldn't.
Nope. The switchboard is lightning up downtown. Kids from other towns are starting to congregate in the parks and at the high school. It's turning into WOODSTOCK except there's no concert.
My house is just a couple of blocks away. Why don't you come on over and clean those cuts up.
of COURSE. You're not scared?
_ Your father raped someone?
Why?
Want to come in for awhile? Log onto AOL, flirt with some married men, head into a private S&M chat room . . .
You ok?
Ok.
I kind of like the idea that we can all lose it together, on the same night. It'll be a lot less scary. You have to go.
I can't right now.
Hi Miss Dunlop. Where do you keep the old town papers?
Don't you think it's sick?
Unfortunately I qualify. Think I'm too old?
No.
Why?
Did Sharon say no?
I can't believe I listened to one word of his shit.
What's wrong? Am I doing something wrong?
Oh GOD IT'S HIM!
What are you doing?
Hi princess.
Yes?
I need to ask you something.
What?
That's what he said.
She was raped. At least that's what she claimed.
People thought these guys had a right to rape her because she called them 'queers'?
Just thinking about something.
You can have both if you want.
There's Jan and Heather. Let's grab them quick before someone else does.
Maybe it won't stay in.
Yeah. I'm extremely worried about that. It's right up there with global warming.
If sheep don't count.
That wasn't me ...
You're being unfair.
Damn.
Look, you need me to sign an invoice or somethin'?


Well, he told me to collect cash.
...off.  Say, uh, three seventy-five. Seein' that we both have so much love...
That'll make up the difference, huh?

For cryin' out loud.

You want cash?
Damn.

...town. 
No, no, no.
...-er.
I didn't steal the truck! He owed it to me!  Anyway, the important thing is I'm not goin' through Missoula!
Every time I look at you, I wanna hit...
Shut up, shut up!  It's beeping.

...up!
You think we can make what?!  You see that truck?!
...do we?
Goddamn!
Come on, old Pete.
Come on.
...-hood of you knowin' any prayers is slim...

 Go on.
 Go, go.
Yeah...
...yeah.
Okay.  All right.  Okay. 
...here!

See, now why would you do that to a man in my posi-...
...piece of shit was worth.
And he swore, he swore once I got a degree...
...there'd be a sales rep desk with my name on it.  But every time something opened up, there'd be some idiot cousin...
...overdrawn bank accounts.
Nobody's lookin' out for my interests.  My credit was fucked!  And then when he promoted Sam over me, I just snapped.  So I split.
We were nationally  ranked.
How wonderful for you.
To tell you the truth, you didn't.
...-er.  It was your friend...


 Come on!

 That's why I didn't give it...
What?
Sometimes the prey bites back.
...-ful?!
Whoo!
Forty-seven.  You'd better floor it.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Arlo, I'm gonna get Elvis.  You go.
Look.  That's negotiating? He threatened to kill...
What'd he say?
Your move.  Okay, Vaughn, you drive.
Well, that just about figures for today.
So you called the damned thing Elvis

You-You can't let him...
...on ice!  We've got Elvis on ice!
Thank you.
...including the permanently extreme.
If it works, your stock at the Pentagon will go up along with mine.  I don't think I need to mention you could use the help.
You have my word on that.
No!
You'll kill us all!
Damn you, Long!  My people are out there! Your people are out there!
You look fit...healthy...
...that.
Oh, I'm well aware of what the government did, I assure you.  Actually, I've just come to say how grateful I am to you...
Grateful?
Mm-hm.
...years of thinking the matter over, I began to see that the whole thing wasn't really my problem.
Do you know what'll...
Good to see you again, Leo.
I can't say it's a surprise.
...-ians.  But I assure you, Leo...
Knowing you, Brynner, you've got buyers waiting to buy! You're not gonna use that...
Get 'em on line, then stall.  Long can't have gotten far.
Vaughn.
...-ther orders?
We're gonna use them for demonstration  footage.
...in Missoula.  All we need to do is get to Mason before anyone else does.
...-mand out of Fort Bragg.
We were called in by the Jerome base...
...-ty.
Hemmings!  Sam, I thought I told you to close up shop and be ready to move up the island by night-...
Yes, Captain Brynner, you did, but-but--
...what, Sam?  Can't I go down to the loading dock for a few hours without coming back to find a major...
Is this your establishment?
Doc...
I want you to look at one another...
...and ask a simple question -   Are you actually prepared...


...-time,  remember?
...he's smart enough to get you...
Ah.
Rangers.
No sign of 'em...

Uh-huh.
...colonel?
There's nothin' goin' on out there, doc...except maybe the occasional fly fisherman.

And I'm good at this.  Been doing it since I was a kid.  But you, I don't know.  Somehow you think...
He's brains without ambition...
...and that power...

Never let it reach fifty degre-degrees.
...-m-means, Mason.  
Forty-seven.
So, Mason, last Wednesday night, uh...were you out...
You find yourself wearing a...
...selling this young man beer Wednesday night.
You know, I gotta tell you.  That really bothers me, somebody calls me "son."
Let me see your...
...stole a truck under arrest.
Don't move!
Oh.
...gotta seal it.
Now!  Seal that tunnel now!
Can I check one of these volumes out?
Tell me. What do the police say?
That's too bad.
It's what the D.A. used to tell me about Chinatown.
Yes, his girlfriend.
Doesn't that strike you as odd?
No. She's probably scared to death.
My daughter.
Hello.
Where's that?
Off the alley.
The apple core club.
How'd you get past the guards?
I get by.
You're behind the times, Jake. They've got steam irons now.  And I'm out of Chinatown.
Oh yes.
I'd like to talk to him.
No. It was an accident.
What are you doing here?
I don't.
I don't think about it one way or the other. But if you want, give me a day or two, and I'll get back to you. Now I'd like to go home.
What pictures?
No, Gittes, you'll show us.
Give you three minutes.
Mrs. Mulwray, it's a very serious offense pointing that at an officer of the law. It's a felony.
Get him away from her. He's responsible for everything. Get him away from her!
...Well, it didn't make him happy...
You and your husband never discussed her?
But I thought you'd hired a private investigator.
Would you like something to drink?
So let's just drop the whole thing. Sugar?  Lemon?
Why?... What on earth for?  Look, Hollis seems to think you're an innocent man.
It's very personal. It couldn't be more personal. Is this a business or an obsession with you?
Mrs. Mulwray, I'm afraid that's not good enough.
And you weren't the slightest bit upset about it?
Did you have affairs?
Mr. Gittes.
Where you were when your husband died.
Of course I'm sure.
I gave everybody the night off.
There's something black in the green part of your eye.
That's not what it looks like, Mrs. Mulwray.
Sure.
Going somewhere?
Yes positively. That's where he was drowned...
Katherine?... Katherine who?
Hollis came and took... care of me... after she was born... he said... he took care of her... I couldn't see her... I wanted to but I couldn't... I just want to see her once in a while... take care of her... that's all...  but I don't want her to know... I don't want her to know...
Back to Mexico.
How about a plane?
I think I got something.
Oh yes we have... are you alone, Mr. Gittes?
...Why don't you give me your address and we can talk this over?
A Miss Sessions calling.
Just, if you will, confine yourself to the main building. It's nearly bedtime.
And Mulwray isn't?
You don't happen to know where Mr. Mulwray's having lunch?
Mr. Gittes, sorry to keep you waiting. These staff meetings, they just go on and on.
Mr. Gittes?
Sure you do.
I'm afraid not, Mrs. Mulwray. These men are my operatives and at some point they're going to assist me. I can't do everything myself.
Lot of turnover these days. Better tell them to get in touch with me if they want to hang onto their land.
He's liable to be tied up indefinitely.
He owned the water department?
Yes.
How did they get it away from him?
Mr. Mulwray felt the public should own the display. The water. If you'll just read the display.
They were partners.
Yeah. What's wrong with you guys? Think ahead. We find 'em, sue 'em. We'll make a killing.  We'll have dinner at Chasen's twice a week, we'll be pissing on ice the rest of our lives.
Not exactly.
That right?... She used to be some looker.
She ain't exactly long in the tooth now.
No, he's only got one, I remember her age, I read it in the newspapers when she ran away.
Well, you never know, do you?
Signora Maria, don't do that. He's just a kid.  And why are you telling fibs?  We let him in free. He must have lost the money inside the movie theatre...  How much did you have?
Then why don't you want to teach it to me too? Now that there's no more cranking, and it's easier?
But don't you like anything about what you do? 
Why? What do you mean?
Nothing, there's nothing. It's all out of focus.
Yes, it's a girl I saw at the station.
Eh! Love...what a mystery!  I understand you, Toto...The ones with blue eyes are the most beautiful. Whatever you do, you can't make friends with them.  Eh, there's nothing to be done about it! The heavier a man is, the deeper his footprints. And if he's in love, he suffers, because he knows he's up a one-way street. Because love is a meaningless thing when a man gets it into his head to do what he wants... 
But why? There must be some way to make her understand!
You see, it s like I say. You always have an answer for everything.
Hi. Why are you running?
For what?
You're still beautiful...
Then where's the money?
The projector's all rusty, but I could fix it in two or three days. Give the place a good cleaning, put in some seats and bring in a projectionist and we'll show Catene in two houses.
He sure did, Mr. Kane.
I can't take shorthand.
It's a saying, Mr. Bernstein.  A new broom sweeps clean.
Gentlemen of the "Enquirer"!  This has, I think, been a fitting welcome to those distinguished journalists -  Mr. Reilly in particular - who are the latest additions to our ranks. It will make them happy to learn that the "Enquirer's" circulation this morning passed the two hundred thousand mark.
Who's a busy man?  Me?  I'm Chairman of the Board.  I got nothing but time ...  What do you want to know?
Sure, sure.
Thatcher!  That man was the biggest darn fool I ever met -
In case you'd like to know, Mr. Bernstein, he's at the Huntington Memorial Hospital on 180th Street.
You don't say!  Why I had no idea -
I'm not guaranteeing a thing, Mr. Bernstein.  You people work too fast for me!  Talk about new brooms!
What's the matter?
If you hadn't come along and protected me when you did, I'd have killed them fellows.
You may resume your work, gentlemen.  I didn't know your plans and so I was unable to make any preparations.
As a matter of fact, we sent a man to the Silverstone home yesterday afternoon.  Our man even arrived before the "Chronicle" reporter.  And there's no proof that the woman was murdered - or even that she's dead.
I've been a newspaperman my whole life and I don't intend -  - if it's your intention that I should continue to be harassed by this - this -  I warn you, Mr. Kane, it would go against my grain to desert you when you need me so badly - but I would feel obliged to ask that my resignation be accepted.
Was the show covered by every department?
That's Leland, isn't it?
The nurse has complete instructions, but if you care to talk to me at any time, I should be only too glad -  I shall be here in the morning.
What story, Mr. Rogers?
Hello, Brad -
Maybe I should have - the first time he showed me what a mad dog he really was.
He's paying for it, Emily.  Those returns tonight - he's finished. Politically -  - socially, everywhere, I guess. I don't know about the papers, but -
Here I am, darling...  Darling!... Darling, it's all right...  Mother's here.
I intend to find out.
I don't think so.  Are you coming, Charles?
What's funny now?
Oh!
I'm sorry.  They live here, too?
I can't stay here all night chasing your pain away.
No.  But you're close.
A rooster?
I work at Seligman's.
Is that what you want to do?
I couldn't make you see how I felt, Charlie.  I just couldn't -  I couldn't go threw with singing again. You don't know what it means to feel - to know that people - that an audience don't want you.  That if you haven't got what they want - a real voice - they just don't care about you.  Even when they're polite - and they don't laugh or get restless or - you know... They don't want you.  They just 0
We can discuss all this some other time, Susan.  Right now -
What you want me to want, you mean. What you've decided I ought to have - what you'd want if you were me. But you've never given me anything that -
Well, I'm not going to stop it.  I'm going to say exactly what I think.  You've never given me anything.  You've tried to buy me into giving you something.  You're -  - it's like you were bribing me!  That's what it's been from the first moment I met you.  No matter how much it cost you - your time, your money - that's what you've done with everybody you've ever known.  Tried to bribe them!
Anything you say, Mr. Kane.  Only we're talking now about what you are.  That's what the note is about, Mrs. Kane.  Now I'm going to lay all my cards on the table.  I'm fighting for my life.  Not just my political life.  My life.  If your husband is elected governor -
It's the only vein I know.  I tell the facts the way I see them.  And any man that knows that facts -
Yes, Mr. Kane.
Tired?
It's been a tough day.
Well, gentlemen, are we going to war?
Yes?
You don't want to be a war correspondent - how about being a dramatic critic?
Charlie -
Why not?
Oil belonging to the people of the United States was leased out for a song to a gang of high-pressure crooks -  Nobody can blame me because -
What?
I'm drunk.
She hasn't any friends left sine you started this oil business, and she never sees you.
You talk about the people of the United States as though they belonged to you.  When you find out they don't think they are, you'll lose interest.  You talk about giving them their rights as though you could make a present of liberty. Remember the working man?  You used to defend him quite a good deal. Well, he's turning into something called organized labor and you don't like that at all.  And listen, when your precious underprivileged really get together - that's going to add up to something bigger than - than your privilege and then I don't know what you'll do - sail away to a desert island, probably, and lord it over the monkeys.
You want love on your own terms, don't you, Charlie -  Love according to your own rules. And if anything goes wrong and you're hurt - then the game stops, and you've got to be soothed and nursed, no matter what else is happening - and no matter who else is hurt!
Maybe we'd better wait for more word on the President's condition.
Mr. Leland sent back that check.
It's going to be done exactly the way I've told Mr. Thatcher -
Well, let's hope it's all for the best.
Yes.
I don't know.  He was disappointed in the world.  So he built one of his own -  An absolute monarchy -  It was something bigger than an opera house anyway -  Nurse!  Say, I'll tell you one thing you can do for me, young fellow.
Anything and everything - he was a regular crow.
Yes, and maybe he didn't.
What do you think all that is worth, Mr. Thompson?
In case you've never heard of how I lost all my money - and it was plenty, believe me -
She's plastered, isn't she?
Jesus!
Thanks. Have a good one.
Do you mind if I drink this here?
No, I think I'll drink it in here, thanks.
Hey, now wait a sec...
I think you'd better leave now.
Randal Graves-scourge of the video renter.
You might be let down. I'm not a hermaphrodite.
Nobody can figure it out. And the boss doesn't want to pay the electrician to fix it, because the electrician owes money to the video store.
And I'm caught in the middle-torn between my loyalty for the boss, and my desire to piss with the light on.
You're very protective of him, Randal. You always have been.
Territoriality. He was mine first.
When did you get back?
Very dramatic, I thought.
You could've broke it to me gently, you know; at least started by telling me you had a boyfriend. I told you I have a girlfriend.
I know, I'm sorry. But when we started talking... it's like I forgot I had a boyfriend. And then he proposed last month...
Well... kind of, sort of?
Then my mother called me this morning and told me the announcement was in the paper. That's when I hopped the train to come back here, because I knew you'd be a wreck.
But you were.
I'm sure Sang and-Veronica?-would like that.
Yes. A real date. Dinner and a movie.
What about Sing?
So what are you saying?
This isn't fucking funny, Dante!
What time was this?
Wait a second? Who was working here today?
We did.
Then who operated the store?
I'M GONNA BREAK YOUR FUCKING HEAD! YOU FUCKING JERKOFF!
All right, now if you're really feeling dangerous tonight, then Smokey and the Bandit Three is the movie you must rent.
The boss called. Arthur fell ill.
Bunch of savages in this town.
That's what I said.
I'm a firm believer in the philosophy of a ruling class, especially since I rule.  Is the Pelican flying?
Want something to drink? I'm buying.
Did you tell Veronica?
I'm going to offer you some advice, my friend: let the past be the past. Forget Caitlin Bree. You've been with Veronica for how long now?
Chick's nuts about you. How long did you date Caitlin?
That's cheating?
She was supposed to meet Brad Michaelson in a bedroom. She picked the wrong one. She had no idea I was even at the party.
Allan Harris.
Oh shit, I've got to place an order.
No, no, I'm listening. She's leaving college, and...?
What's that?
Now, he's in charge of the Empire. The Imperial government is under his control. And the entire galaxy is under Imperial rule.
Compliments of Lando Calrissian.
Well, the thing is, the first Death Star was manned by the Imperial army- storm troopers, dignitaries-the only people onboard were Imperials.
The second time around, it wasn't even finished yet. They were still under construction.
Not just Imperials, is what you're getting at.
All right, so even if independent contractors are working on the Death Star, why are you uneasy with its destruction?
He said he has to find a perfect dozen.
Did you ever notice all the prices end in nine? Damn, that's eerie.
You know how much money the average jizz-mopper make per hour?
Can we talk about this later?
Vermont?
Sorry.
See? There you go again.
We're not playing in the street.
After an exhausting game like that I can believe it.
Oh, my god.
How? When?
I haven't seen her in almost two years.
No, you're not.
Shit. What about tomorrow?
I'm not missing what's probably going to be the social event of the season.
You hate people.
If you go, I go.
I'm not taking you to this funeral.
I can't close the store.
How'd he die?
Stop it.
Oh, my god.
What, your dick?
I can't fucking believe you!!
I was just leaning on it! It was an accident!
So the casket fell over! Big deal!
So they'll put her back in! It's not like it's gonna matter if she breaks something!
Let me borrow your car.
Can you imagine being halfway decent to the customers at least some of the time?
What the fuck did you do that for?
Please, get the hell out of here.
Hermaphroditic porn. Starlets with both organs. You should see the box: Beautiful women with dicks that put mine to shame.
No way!
I don't; you did.
Little girl. Maybe five years old?
Now I know you're lying.
She's not going to marry that guy. She went home to tell her mother.
Wow. You've had quite an evening.
Who eats cock?
I told her that. She said she didn't need any. Why don't you join her, man. Make a little bathroom bam-bam.
Have some chips; you'll feel better.
Leave me alone.
I'm satisfied with my situation for now. You don't hear me bitching. You, on the other hand, have been bitching all day.
Thank you. Why don't you go back to the video store?
It's the same thing with Veronica.
Jesus H. Christ, I can't!
How's your eye?
You didn't have to choke me.
What time did you get to work today?
I'm calling out. Going to hit the hospital-see how Caitlin is. Then try to see Veronica.
He's got those love handles.
Do I know you?
Caitlin Bree. Yeah?
Sounds to me like somebody needs to hit the gym.
How much can you bench?
Yeah.
We get off about the same time every night. We should hang out.  You get high?
I don't know. I wasn't watching.
And what-you were gonna dump her to date that Caitlin chick?
I'm sure he wasn't sleeping.
Such a wiseass. But go ahead. Crack wise. That's why you're jockeying a register in some fucking local convenience store instead of doing an honest day's work.  I got no more time to bullshit around waiting for that sonofabitch.  You make sure this gets back. The number's eight-twelve-Wynarski. And I wanted to get a damn movie, too.
No, he got hit by a bus.
The white kind.
Say, young fella, you know I hate to bother you again, but can I take a paper or something back there... to read?  It usually takes me a while, and I like to read while it's going on.
Can I trouble you for one of those magazines?
Yeah. I like the cartoons. They make me laugh. They draw the biggest titties.
Then quit. You should be going to school anyway...
Why don't you open the shutters and get some sunlight in here?
I don't know-like two-thirty, three.
Nothing! Jesus! I gotta fight with you now?
How do you know they're taking the right amount of change? Or even paying for what they take?
I touched a nerve.
You were making a generalization about "broads!"
Do I get to hit you after you tell me?
They put up the least amount of struggle.
Shit! Why are we getting up?
Because I did only sleep with three guys! That doesn't mean I didn't just go with people.
All right! Shut up a second and I'll tell you! Jesus! I didn't freak like this when you told me how many girls you fucked.
I'M THIRTY-SEVEN?
I'm going to school. Maybe later you'll be a bit more rational.
Thirty-seven. I just can't...
What is it?
You had to tell him.
The ostrich syndrome: if you don't see it...
What're you talking about?
And then you pull that shit this morning, freaking out because I've gone down on a couple guys!
A couple...?
I'm not out of shape!
No way.
What part of Russia?
Is he staying here?
He really wants to play metal?
Sure. How about the beach?
My man is deaf.  I'M GOING TO JOHN K'S PARTY!  Neh.
Twenty bucks?
Fuck you.
And it's such a handsome head. Please Frank, and I swear I'll buy one of your paintings.
Jessie, Jessie, copy?
Throw it up or I'll kill her.
Funny, he told me he twisted it gettin' out of a hot tub.
Remember, keep your arms and legs within the vehicle at all times--
We'll never know, will we?
No, buddy, it was you who dropped it!
Forget me.  If you can, get away.
I'm going with you.
Use your other hand!  Grab it!
Gabe?  Gabe, where are you?
I don't understand?
I'm not going to faint, but if I want to faint, I'll faint, okay?
You come back after being gone almost a year, and you expect me to just leave...  This was <u>our</u> home, now it's <u>my</u> home.  I can't leave.  You can stay with me, and believe me, I want you to, but to just take off for the wrong reasons, I can't do it.  And you shouldn't either.
And I can't leave.
You know where everything is...  I'm late for my shift.
He doesn't want my help.
For the same reason you did, to help.
Let's be creative.
If you're not using your arm, can I borrow it?
We have to get through to the other side.  You up for it?
A simple yes or no would have done.
What was God thinking when he built this place?
I've never weighed 135 lbs.!
Don't let me fall!
No, he's gone.
Yeah...
Tucker and Walker.
Have her come up.
This way.
No, that son-of-a-bitch Walker is alive.
Rich...
Good morning, Walt.
There was some sophistos from the TV studios around the corner, laughing an govoreeting. The Devotchka was smecking away, and not caring about the wicked world one bit. Then the disc on the stereo twanged off and out, and in the short silence before the next one came on, she suddenly came with a burst of singing, and it was like for a moment, O my brothers, some great bird had flown into the milkbar and I felt all the malenky little hairs on my plott standing endwise, athe shivers crawling up like slow malenky lizards and then down again. Because I knew what she sang. It was a bit from the glorious 9th, by Ludwig van. Dim makes a lip-trump followed by a dog howl, followed by two fingers pronging twice in the air, followed by a clowny guffaw. Alex brings his stick down smartly on Dim's legs.
What did you do that for?
For being a bastard with no manners and not a dook of an idea how to comport yourself publicwise, O my Brother.
No. She's dead!
Help you.
Naughty, naughty, naughty, you filthy old soomaka.
Well, as I've said, we've heard about you. We are interested in your case. We want to help you.
But first we'd like to find out a few things about you.
What would you like to know, sir?
You've not been to school all week, son.
Eeee... I'll put your breakfast in the oven. I've got to be off myself now.
Alex.
To what do I owe this extreme pleasure, sir? Anything wrong, sir? Deltoid "playfully" grabs Alex's hair.
A big black mark I tell you for every one we don't reclaim. A confession of failure for every one of you who ends up in the stripy hole.
What gets into you all? We study the problem. We've been studying it for damn well near a century, yes, but we get no further with our studies. You've got a good home here, good loving parents, you've got not too bad of a brain. Is it some devil that crawls inside of you?
Um... oh no, sir, not exactly, I still feel very miserable, very much down in spirits.
Do you still feel suicidal?
Um... well, put it this way... I feel very low in myself. I can't see much in the future, and I feel that any second something terrible is going to happen to me. He pitches forward, face into the plate of spaghetti.
What crime did you commit.
Was I alright, sir? Did I do well, sir?
One I think you will like... as a, how shall I put it, as a symbol of our new understanding. An understanding between two friends.
Well - I'm back.
Well. That was all took away, son, by the Police. New regulation about compensation for the victim.
... and that... He pulls Alex's ear, pushes him off balance and plants his foot on his chest.
Brown hair, is it?
Do you wear eye glasses or contact lenses?
Do you wear any false teeth or false limbs?
Lice?
No, sir.
We're going to friends now, sir.
Bollocks. You know what you can do with that watch? You can stick it up your arse. Slide of nude woman in bed, a man at the window.
I hope so. Is that the end then?
Good. I'm glad
You're keen on music?
One thing I could never stand is to see a filthy, dirty old drunkie, howling away at the filthy songs of his fathers and going blerp, blerp in between as it might be a filthy old orchestra in his stinking rotten guts. I could never stand to see anyone like that, whatever his age might be, but more especially when he was real old like this one was. The boys stop and applaud him.
Oh-hhh!!! Go on, do me in you bastard cowards. I don't want to live anyway, not in a stinking world like this.
Oh, thankyou, your honour. The Tramp takes a second look at Alex.
Certainly, my son, certainly. Is there something troubling you, my son? Don't be shy to speak up. Remember, I know all the urges that can trouble young men deprived of the society of women.
I don't care about the danger, Father. I just want to be good. I want for the rest of my life to be one act of goodness.
One pair of trousers - blue pinstriped.
Sir, 655321, sir.
Don't read it - sign it!
And there's Will the English in the Muscleman coffee mesto saying he can fence anything that anything that any malchick tries to crast.
The shiny stuff. The Ice. The big, big, big money is available's what Will the English says.
Moloko-plus.
Well, it's a surprise all right, a bit bewildering too.
How many to a cell?
Sixth is faster.
I used to play this piece back in high school.
Let me guess.  Clarinet?
This?  Temporary.  To pay the bills and save. I got plans...
Like what?
Big case?
You never answered my question.  You like what you do?
But not now?
Just had one.
Thanks for everything, Max.  Wow...
Max, the cab driver!
I'm...fine.  Fine.
He'd come over from Queens to do the Ed Sullivan show.  After, he decides to come on up to Harlem and hang with the common folk.  That's how he was, you see.  Never forgot where he came from.  Money and fame an' all that?  Meant nothin', long as he could blow that horn.  So before you it, he's up on that stage, doin' his thing.
Get outta here!  You and Louis?
Fella owned this place back then, Dix Dwyer, he let slip to Louis that I played.  So Pops, he just waves me right up.  My heart about stopped. But I got up there all the same, and we played for nearly twenty minutes.
The crowd had to dig it.
Vincent.  Do not cross me.
...got off the phone with his dispatcher.  What an asshole. Cabbie's name is Max Rilke, been driving that cab for ten years...
Cabbie drove around all night.  Three people got killed.
They found him dead in his own cab down by the Port Authority.
Oh?
...yeah, I'm still at Bellevue.  The John Doe didn't pan out, but you'll never guess who's lying up in the meat locker.
Jesus.  Two in one night?
Why didn't you tell me we had company?  And what's your name?
It's nothing.
Client?  I like to think of myself as more of a friend.  A mentor.
Try?
What am I gonna do with flowers?
It got crashed!  I didn't...
...why is everything always about you...
It's home.
You prefer nights?
Yeah.  Retirement?  Paid sick leave?
I don't talk about it, you know...  No offense.
He fell on my cab!  From up th-th-there.
You - you killed him?
I don't think I can do this.
South Central.
Music.
How can you kill him like that?
I'll talk to them, I'll talk to them.
Hands on the wheel.  Ten and two o'clock, like they taught you in driver's ed.
So what?
I need the job.
But, hey, some good news.  This last one put me way ahead of schedule. We've actually got some time to kill.  Jazz?  You like jazz?
God, are you always this prosaic?  You don't learn jazz, it's not something you're <u>taught.</u> It's like breathing, like life.  Like us, tonight, taking what comes and going with the flow.
You mind?  I'm working here.
Don't even think you're walking away from me.
Guy with a routine goes and breaks it? Provokes attention.  That's bad.  And that's not good...
You take one more step, I'll kill her.
I'll just hold onto it for you.  In case they check.
Our friends in Little Russia.  Go in and ask for a man named Dmitri.
Dmitri?
Vincent.  Don't make me do this. Don't make me get people killed.
That cop!  Why'd you have to do that?  You couldn't wound him?  The guy had a family, maybe, parents, kids who gotta grow up without a dad, he was probably a good guy; and he believed me...
<u>I'm</u> full of shit?  You're a monument of bullshit.  You even bullshitted yourself all I am, is taking out the garbage.  Bad guys killing bad guys...
That's the reason?
Saved you last night's, too.
Come on!  Six major earthquakes in the last three years?  The space shuttle in orbit for every one of them?
I better get going.
Lucky guess... Um, I'd feel a lot less naked if we could get outta here.
Dead or alive, they'll stick me in there with Oswald.  Another lunatic acting alone,
Oswald was an assassin.  You're not an assassin, are you, Jerry?
Uh uh, don't want <u>them</u> to see me.
As opposed to?
How long have we known each other, Jerry?
If my universe had a hub...
I didn't mean for you to see it. It's like looking in someone's diary and taking it out of context.  Know what I mean?
Not this again.
Jesus... It's my fault.  They drew a black line over me and now I'm passing it on.  I'm passing it to you, too.
I'll be fine.  Let's worry about Henry Finch.  P.O. Box in St. Louis.  He's the last on the list. I haven't been able to reach him yet.
There are all kinds of groups, all kinds of initials.  But they're all part of two warring factions. One:  families that have held wealth for centuries. They want one thing.  Stability. Group Two:  the boat rockers. Eisenhower's military industrial complex.  They want instability. It's a trillion dollar a year business.  When there isn't a hot war, they make a cold one.
His obituary was in every paper. But not one of them said he was murdered.
It said in the paper he drowned in a swimming pool.  <u>In Newport</u>.
I see the big picture and you stumble around in the details.
What if I reached a point where you didn't think I was crazy anymore?  If I was normal.
If you were eating Kentucky Fried Chicken and drinking Coca-Cola again.
Yeah...  Would you, I mean, could you love me then?  If I was normal.  Maybe?
No.  That wouldn't be fair.  Where are we going, Jerry?
After you.  It's okay.  I'm the one who left it here.
My father's house.
Did you kill him?
Then tell me what happened.
I believe you.
You got to get out of here.  My cell phone's on.  Back in the truck.
How did you know?
Get in.  I'll pull you up to the fourth floor.
You should think of me as Liza Sutton's guardian angel.
I don't know...
And you feel bad for it?
Honestly?  I think he has a crush on me.
If you're as impressed to see me as I am to see you, you're very impressed indeed.  How's Jerry feeling this morning?
As in 'resulting in death.'  We pushed the envelope until it wasn't even an envelope anymore.
Jerry told me he bit your nose.
The office is closed for the evening. Is this an emergency?
Go ahead, Miss Sutton.
Jonas?
When I'm ready to compare notes, I'll let you know.
What?
Hope there's a cartoon.
Glad to have you, David.  How's the new office?
Last week, about 3 A.M., Fish -- Dr. Fisher -- was on a late shift, and he found her doing laundry.
Oh?  How's he doing?
Now exactly.  It's... complicated.
Goddamnit, they are out there, David --
Then why haven't you detected any signals?  If, as you claim, there have been thousands, millions of advanced civilizations out there for millions of years then why hasn't one signal gotten through?  It'll take a month or two for the paperwork to go through; you're welcome to stay until then.
David --
If it's attention you want I'd say you've got it.  Just one thing:  Why Vega? Everyone's looked at Vega for years with no results, and now, yesterday, they start broadcasting primes. Why?
You mean --
I'm asking for your help, David.  I want to go.  They'll need someone relatively young, unattached -- and probably a scientist.  As the President's Science Advisor you have enormous weight... I'm asking if you'll support my candidacy.
They knew our level of development. If, as you say, they've done this many times they'd be well aware of the implications.
Ellie... we both know that if I was any kind of a man, I never would've entered this race.  That I would have told the President straight out:  Helen, Eleanor Arroway is naive and strident and an enormous pain in the ass... but she's got more courage and intelligence than the rest of us put together.  That more then anyone else on the planet, she's earned this.  And that she should be the one to go because she's the best we have.  But that's not who I am.  I like to think it's who I might've been if things had gone a different way; that I might have been worthy, really worthy of what I've been given...  You do what you have to do.  And in the end, as with everything, it comes down to power.  And it isn't fair...
What's the status of the decryption effort?
There's no way of knowing.  Without a key -- a primer, to help us, maybe never.
1919+21.  Found a glitch in the timing; probably a starquake.
It's beautiful.
There is no direct evidence, no.
But what do I say?
On that old shortwave?  Maybe on a clear night.  Come on now, under the covers.
That's my scientist.
So who -- what -- are you?
Many others.
... life is unspeakably rare.  So whenever we do find another civilization, especially one that's... struggling... We send a message.  Sometimes we can offer help.  Sometimes we can't.  But we always try.  Life is simply too precious not to.
You always have been.  We're all descendants of the same stars, Ellie.  All made of the same primordial atoms.
But -- other people from our planet should see what I've seen -- they should witness this for themselves.
You live here.
Page after page of data -- over sixty-three thousand in all, if I'm not mistaken... and at the end of each...
You're saying... there is no separate primer in the message -- because it's on every page so the recipient can decipher it wherever he is --
Yes.  A shame.  Still... it'd be worse if they died for nothing.
What are you talking about?  It's over.
Why don't you come back with me?
They can't.  I think it's against human nature to admit to that level of... insignificance; to not see yourself as basically the center of the universe.
'Any sufficiently advanced technology...'
The V.L.A.?
That's one way of putting it.  Kitz, the President, the I.S.C. have shut down all official communications; there've also been reports of riots flaring up across the U.S. and Europe.  Until we figure out what went wrong things may get rough, especially for you --
And mind, yes.  What are you --
Maybe you're creating a monster.
If you came back.
What'd you think?
I don't know.  But as a scientist I have to consider that possibility.
Have you seen what's happening out there?  The terror, the despair? The world is on fire, Ellie.  People need something they can believe in, something worthy, and you can give it to them!
Meaning...
You have a question, Dr. Arroway?
Git movin', I said.
No it hain't, Luke. You ain't alone. Ever whar you go, I'm with you, and so's John.
Nothin'. Ever'thing's cool's can be.
Then how come it ain't done yet?
She's on to him. You shoulda waited fer me to git her out -- loose like she is, he kin run her crazy.
Well, we ain't never had one of them. Where'd you think that was gonna get you?
That's right, Captain. Just passin' the time.
You can't do that!
Jus' take it slow, buddy.
Looka that! Two of them. Oh my...
Slow down, man. They ain't passing out medals for slinging dirt.
That'sa Lucille, you mullet head! Any girl so innocent and built like that gotta be named Lucille.
What you talkin' about, Luke? We're together, you and me, just like always. Now the thing we gotta work out is how to get Koko outa there and then the Terrible Trio be all complete again. Man, this old Free World ain't gonna know which ear to stand on.
You don't understand a thing, do you, Drag?
Thirty-nine... forty... forty-one... forty-two...
That ole box collapse and fall apart before Luke calls quits.
No more than five. For a cold drink.
I gotta believe. Out!  Now they're rollin'.  King-five-four gets an eight.  Pair'a nines with a Jack gets a four. Ninas still up.
Man, you play like a kokonut. You got to call him at least.
Kick a buck.
He doesn't know when to give in. They'll kill him.
Where were you?  Don't tell me. It's just under seventy, right?  The sun is strong but the air is dry and fresh...
A little heavy breathing is what most of us yearn for.  <u>Forget</u> it.
Cellulite.  What do you say I blindfold you and take you to the gym.  Aerobics with housewives...
The moon is up, my night to howl. Will you be okay?
You're fired.
Where have you <u>been</u>?  What happened to your wallet?
We'll get the paramedics...
She just got to sleep.  Do you have to tell her about it now?
When he was seventeen.
And you believed him when he told you he had done that.
You already made the delivery?
The door was open, swear to God, I'm just looking for her when you come charging up the stairs...
We know...  Send the book to evidence...
You've been perfect.  Don't spoil the symmetry -- you have to have a male cop.
Yes.  I do.  I want it to end now. Let her go.  I'll come -- just let her go.  She's not important.
You know where.
Kill me, Peter, do it, now.
No.  Not yet.
No, ma'am.  This is no joke.  And neither is tying up telephone lines to police with crank calls while people in trouble are trying to get through for help.
Ring the gong, he goes.  Poor impulse control.
<u>You</u> called <u>us</u>, Doctor Hudson.
Well, let's thank God you and Inspector Goetz are on the case, then.
One officer already got killed trying to protect me.  Please, just take it all away.  Leave me alone.
I am not going to look at any more pictures.  They're like a disease. They get into my head.  I can't get them out.
I don't look at pictures.  I look at the <u>real thing</u>.  I don't feel infected.
That's no surprise.
But it's a different m.o.
Then what do you need me for?
There were needle marks.  But no drugs in her blood.
It's what Bianchi and Buono injected into one of their victims.
Injected Windex!  Why would he switch to a new m.o.?
Halloran.
I did not; the Mouth -- that's what we call Susan Schiffer -- got it on her own.
He felt sorry for me.  It was so nice to flirt.  He was a darling man.
You're exhausted.  Let me get you a brandy.
The University computer is down for maintenance, but I've been going through my own notes...
He's hacked into her Internet address.  He's a hacker.
Are you always so bold?
<u>What</u>?...
Working late.  You're a damn fool.
My third grade teacher at the convent shot better than that.
You're good enough you'll never have to kill anyone.  I joined the cops to save lives, not waste them.
Get Mercer to run the medical, dental, legal bills, laundry and dry cleaning receipts, extermin- ators, mailmen, grocery and drugstore deliveries, handymen, plumbers...
Sure.  She likes <u>you</u>, Rube.  She likes the way you move.  She sure as hell isn't in love with me.
He's just mad he let me keep the espresso machine.  We heard from Doctor Hudson?
Nada.  Lemme make the call.
Anybody in this department ever worked a serial killer case?  She's the expert.  I need help.
You ever reflect how this big explosion in dead women coincides with the flowering of women's lib?
It's not the same guy.  It should be a self-solver.  No bow around the neck, left and body outdoors, completely different.  The others were housewives, secretaries, he talked his way inside, killed them in their own living room or bed- or bathroom.  This one didn't have a husband or a boyfriend, no family, temp waitress, 3 arrests for misdemeanor dope offenses, DUI, asphyxiation probably from a plastic bag over her head.  Sexually assaulted.  The others weren't molested that way.  We're waiting for the sperm tests...
You're damn right I do.
The prowler in Hudson's apartment turns out to have a meeting with a suspect...
You got a suspect...
Give me Ruben back...
You want mine, too?  You take his, you take mine.  I'm the one fucked it up...
She's in no shape to give her statement tonight...
...confirm this third murder adds up to a pattern?  Do we have a serial killer on the loose in the city?
We were together six years, sir!
Put in the Kevin Costner.
See, now you've annoyed her.  You know she doesn't like you to touch me.  Does she, widdle wee fing!  Wuhve you so much!  Did you feed her?
She doesn't lie!  You sure you fed her?
She lies all the time.  Why would I say I fed her if I didn't?
The other man, the dead man, his wife is a doctor - Dr. Helen Remington. She's here, somewhere. As a patient, of course. Maybe you'll find her in the hallways tomorrow on your walk.
Where's the car?
Outside in the visitors, car park.
You should have gone to the funeral.
I'm amazed that she'll let you drive her.
Would you like to tuck him, though? In that car?
I've found that I enjoy burying myself in heavy traffic. I like to look at it. Yesterday I hired a taxi driver to drive me around for an hour. "Anywhere", I said.
What is it?
A complimentary ticket for a special stunt-driving exhibition. Definitely not part of the big auto show. There's a map in the packet and a note requesting you be discrete about the location.
I'm going to leave now. Do you want a lift?
No, I mean a crash with a history. Camus' Facel Vega, or Nathaniel Nest's station wagon, Grace Kelly's Rover 3500. Fix it just enough to get it rolling. Don't clean it, don't touch anything else.
Patient.
We discourage family visits for the first 48 hours after an emotional trauma like the kind you've experienced.
Well, Letty, this does present a liability issue for the hospital.
I have a going-away gesture for you, too.
Fuck me.
What's all the dreck?
I can't believe you finally gave me the shirt.
I'll be running it three days a week, and...
Mom, please.
We aren't allowed to wear jewelry in here, Mom.
Don't forget that Paul's a promising young attorney who loves you very much...
I'm so thankful you'll be leaving next week. If you want me to pick you up, I will.
Honestly, Letty.
Letty, you should be in bed.
You can only do what feels best to you now.
Let me shift gears here a minute...  Do you ever hear voices that other people don't hear or see things they don't?
But you're checking it out.
We're supposed to be asleep.
Really?    Me too.
I wish I could have seen that.
Why in the world did you let me start talking in metaphors? That's no way for us to break up.
It's a good thing my family loves you.
Do you?
Well?
I saw Paul leaving.    Did you do the dirty deed?
Yeah.
This is it -- 3B.     Check it out.
I was tired of watching what everyone else wants to watch. Now we can watch two shows at once.
Do you like it?
Hey.
Michael.
You got wine. That's great.
Paul, I just can't go. Is that OK with you or am I committing some horrible crime?
I'm sorry.  I'm just...I'm so tired lately.
Or be up past ten or fraternize with other patients.
It's a doctor, isn't it? That's unethical. I'll have him rung up on malpractice charges so fast his head will spin.
Of all the crazy things. I understood when you dropped out of law school. And during this whole mess, I've tried to be supportive. But, really, Letty, what can you be thinking?
Here's the ring.
Oh, none. None. I completely understand what was going on.
How's work going?    Are you back at school?
I heard about your friend.
What?
Look, Gail, I've been a good teacher.
Agent Hadley.
What are you doing?
Fuck Bastaldi and his brother. These tapes are gold. Do you have any idea what Zammito would pay to get them back?
Yes. We went to the address we were given and had to tie up the owner of the house who turns out to be some Mafia guy.
C'mon, Laurant, America?
Good.   I'm good.
Yeah. That warehouse over on Merchant Street. The volume on our import business has risen dramatically. The proceeds this quarter will be supernumerary due to the --
I will relay the particulars of our conversation to Mr. Maranzano.
Nah, that's just Tony's way of telling me Judge Judy starts in ten minutes. You ever watch it?
Oh Frankie, what's this I hear about your brother?
I did. Joey "Two Tons" and Nicky "The Rake" did the deed.
And for my help I would get what?
Half the tapes.
Thank you.
Laurant and Vincent were in business with Zammito.
We can't.
Do they come with batteries?
Did you know about Bastaldi's deal with Zammito?
We've got to be careful not to use our real names while we're in here.
It's not your fault, Daniel.
Man, I can get anything.
I've got a way with people.
Okay boss.   Where are they?
No. It's just that the French guy had a gunshot wound on his neck. So, this is a homicide. Are you guys involved in this?
Yeah and if you turned it around it would say to go right.
This kind.
I knew I should have driven.
No.   How much?
No.
Who is closer to the wall, Joey or me?
Yeah, I dig him.
The new Beaujolais' come out in France next week. You like wine?
Algeria.
They send us to Zammito's house. The FBI is right across the street watching the whole thing, but they don't move. A crime is going down and they don't move. Why?  Because they were waiting for us to come out so they could arrest us.
It's okay.   It was a long time ago.
Who's gonna see it there?
Yeah. I mean, you are my brother and... well I should have found another way of expressing my disappointment. So, I've decided to make it up to you.
Oh really? Thanks. I thought it was a sewing machine. What the hell is it doing here?
You're back!
Why were you spying on the Yus?
I'm looking for someone.  Jade Fox. I'm a police inspector from Shaan Xi, Gen Su district.  Jade Fox is a master criminal.  I hear she infiltrated the Yus.  She must have come with them when they transferred here.  But with Yu's reputation, I can't just go in and accuse her.
Like most things, I am nothing. It's the same for this sword.  All of it is simply a state of mind.
On guard!
Why are you still here?  You killed a policeman.  You should leave! You'll bring ruin on my whole family.
In that case, perhaps we could be of assistance.
Please sit.
I'm tired now.
Li Mu Bai!  The famous warrior? Why would he give his sword to Sir Te?
But you're just like the characters in the stories.
You know what I mean.  I'm getting married soon, but I haven't lived the life I want.
What do you think?
Please.
Too bad for Meng, but it's not your fault, or Li Mu Bai's.
Don't distance us.  From now on, let's be like sisters.
You say she killed a policeman?
Look at the trouble you've caused. Now you know what Giang Hu life is really like.  If you think of me as your sister, let me give you some sisterly advice.  You can run from marriage, but not your parents.
Not another lecture!  On guard!
You shouldn't have come.
You've got quite a temper.  It's better this way.
Monk Zheng said you were at Wudan Mountain.  He said you were practicing deep meditation.
Yes.
I don't understand.  How can you part with it?  It has always been with you.
It's time for me to leave it behind.
I thought by giving away the sword, I could escape the Giang Hu world. But the cycle of bloodshed continues.
But don't be too lenient.
A murderer?
Sir Te!  It has brought him as much trouble as glory.  Help him to leave these troubles behind. Otherwise, he'll never be able to start anew.
I don't know...
Sir Te, can you find some excuse to invite Madam Yu and her daughter?
And you're gonna tell me who.
And I say I'm dead... and I move.
Yeah, among others.  Hey, man -- you're hit.
He was a present.  Besides, we're moving anyway.  You said.
Mister Funboy.
Can you play "Teddy Bears' Picnic?"  It used to be her favorite.
Does she have a name?
I don't know if I can.  But you have this... and you know where to come.
Do you know what you destroyed?
A year ago.  A very nice lady circulated a petition.  She died. Last Halloween.  Answer yes or no.
I never forget anything, dickhead. That building was a sweep-and- clear; the bitch was a nuisance with her goddamned petition.  It got a little rowdy... end of story.
Cute nickname, don't you think?
How the hell did you do that?
Neither.
Does it hurt?
What the hell are you?
Go away.
Come now.  You've seen the graffiti -- all over the city in the few hors it has taken your men to drop like plague victims. What about your turf, Top?  You don't seem to have ripped out anyone's heart yet.
Now I remember. Annette Harrison. Your father's the new headmaster at Oakwood.
Are you okay?
I'll be fine.
Excuse me?
You can't do this to me. It could ruin me.
Not a whole lot. We take some classes together. He's got a bad rep, but it's mostly bullshit.
I don't know. I've been hearing some awful things about him.
Forever.
That's a first. Most people praised me for it.
Take yourself. You've slept with several women. Are you happier because of it?
A friend wrote me.
Why are you being so dramatic?
Excuse me. Excuse me!
Great book.
That's a matter of opinion.
Shut up.
Why not?
I don't... I don't want to answer that... look we're friends.
No thank you.
That's none of your business.
That's also none of your business.
Well, I was just calling to tell you I was thinking about you and I miss you. I'll let you go.
I can't win with you.
I love you.
You don't know how to love.
I'll call you later and we'll get together and plan your curriculum.
Are you for real?
Okay.
Oh come on Cecile. He's crazy about you.
Cecile if there's one thing I'm great at it's love letters. With my help, he'll be eating out of the palm of your hand. Perhaps we can arrange a little get together for the two of you at my house.
Cecile, you have to tell me.
If she knew, she'd kill me. It happened at your house last night.
Well... not exactly.
Well did you like it?
I'm what you would call a fifth year senior.
I look terrible.
I was just kidding.
Cecile, all I want to do is give you a kiss.
Want a blow job?
I hope for your sake you grow out of this immature phase. It's going to get you into trouble.
Greg, is that you under the covers?
You told her that people are jealous cause I'm loaded?
Where is she?!
McConnell, I'm gonna out your ass in two seconds if you don't tell me where she is.
I'd be careful if I were you. God knows what he's up to.
So that's what this is all about.  We'll get together and plan your curriculum.
Why go through Cecile? Why not just attack Court?
Oh come on, Kathryn. It's too easy. "But I thought high school was only four years." I mean, please. She knows nothing. She's seen nothing. I could have her under the table at Au Bar sucking me off before the appetizer arrived. Go get one of those moron friends of yours to do it. I have a reputation to uphold.
Oh yes. I've read it over and over again. This baby's the real deal. Daddy's little angel. A paradigm of chastity and virtue.
I'll give you something you've been jerking off about ever since our parents got married.
Be more specific.
In English.  I'll fuck your brains out.
No.
The plot thickens. It appears that Cecile has fallen for her music teacher.
I hate when things don't go my way. It makes me so horny.
Have you succeeded in your task?
That her?
I'm not losing the bet. It's just taking longer than I expected.
Morning!
If you're heading towards her room, you won't find her.
Where'd she go?
Bad time?
Tell me all the details.
I know. That's the amazing part of it. I mean, it wasn't like Cirque du Soleil acrobatics, just standard missionary stuff, but it was... ah forget it. I'm going to sound like a Hallmark card.
It clearly is why.
Oh come on, Kathryn, it was just a contest.
I'd love to, but unfortunately I'm expecting some company.
Silly rabbit. My triumph isn't over her. It's over you.
Not at all. What's wrong?
It's Cecile.
Do you know where she is?
Do you know when she'll be back?
We played backgammon?
Uh huh. You beat me three times.
Nope.
Kathryn. Did you hit her?
Mommy, could Edward take me to Mrs. Farren's house to give her her present?
It's nearly a quarter after four. The party was for four, wasn't it?
Yes, darling,
You're shouting at me.
No, she went runnin' off to some old house she was talkin' about yesterday.
But you told me in the garden-- that the wish about the tree couldn't come true.
Daddy?
Irena. But who are you?
I can not tell you.
Will you be friend for always?
For as long as you'll let me.
No. This must be a friendship that only we shall have... you and I... Amy and her friend.
Of course. And Two is the prince who kneels before her on one knee.
Yes, yes! I see Prince,
That one's an elm.
Yes, winter's coming.  I don't like the winter,
I shall wear it in my hair!
Merry Christmas.
It is wildness and freedom. No one can touch it.
That's a fine-looking ring.
I wasn't singing to myself.
You're going to be busy all day long, Edward.
But what happened to the little deer?
But I only came to give back the ring.
I hate the storm. I hate it!
And my eyes...my eyes are gray. Look! You see!
Let the child stay.
What is it, ma'am?
That's because she made a promise, and she'a keeping it, aren't you, darling.  You saw the way she played this afternoon, Edward.
Waiter! She needs more water.
James Dean, Humphrey Bogart...
Translation: a total geek.
Sorry. It's just so bad lately. You're so lucky you never get PMS.
I never thought of it like that. I never know what to do on dates. Do guys still pay?
He was cute, huh? Of course whenever I meet a guy, I'm wearing no make-up.
What the hell is the tampon test?
I'm freaking out. I'm like an animal and totally out of control. My arms keep getting really hairy.
How'd it go with the cop?
Okay. I guess so.
Tuesday. Are you okay?
Frida, Carlton's dead.
He's been here all night?
There's kind of this guy I'm seeing.
You're right. It's just, I can't cover up a murder so George won't know you're cheating.
The thing is, I really like him. I finally meet a guy I really like and I'm a fuckin' werewolf.
Sorry -- I shouldn't go on about myself at a time like this. Are you sure you're going to be okay?
So you're Grant's secretary?
You're kidding, really?
Well, whattdaya think?
I didn't have to pee then.
You do though. You look really... is that a wonderbra?
Hey wait, I paid three bucks for that burger. You owe me...
You haven't even paid me back the thousand bucks you owe me!
I wish I could help but last I saw Gregory was outside my front door.
No really, I love knowing what people read.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry Peter. Gee, that sure puts my problems in perspective.
Oh, nothing's wrong. Just... well don't you have your period?
No. No, I'm fine. Maybe I should go. I mean... I don't want our first time to be like this.
Frida, can we come in? We need to talk to you. It's important.
No, why?
No. It doesn't work that way. Men can't get PMS. Unfortunately.
What about... those guys... I might have...
No way can anything be proved. All they have are some wolf hairs. No one believes in werewolves.
We didn't have sex.
It's about Gregory Jameson. He's dead.
Come on, I've been working with Frida. Carlton won't even recognize her now. She's really coming out of her shell.
She's just insecure. Once you get to know her she's fabulous.
You can't believe this bullshit.
You want her sheets?
I didn't trust her. All that blood on the sheets. She may look sweet, but she could be a wolf in sheep's clothing. Something's weird.
I told you she was innocent.
Hey, there was a lot of blood.
Back in the '80's. You didn't see the pictures? They were from before she got famous. She was hairy as hell. Her pits, her bush.
Deal. And if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, shoot him.
You think mafia hit?
Police.  Nobody move.
Just visiting my patient.
You seem a little edgy.  Everything okay?
That's surprising.  He was leaving your office at the time...
Thompson suffered a kind of severe delusion or some damn thing.  Anyway he isnít with us any longer.  The case is yours.  Go through his files. Take what you need.  By the way, howís your mother?
Good.
Yes, sir.  <u>Everything</u>?
They didn't have faces.
Jesus!  We have to get you to a doctor...
I didn't realise...
Ah, that would be cheating, wouldn't it?  Is there nothing <u>you</u> remember?  Not even a detail?   You must try.
What does she say?  The woman.
Horrible...
If you would only take this, inject it in your brain, everything would be much clearer.
Please!  Don't be foolish!  Time is short.  Let me show you something. Look at this syringe.
What is it?
How do you know I'm innocent?
How do I get there?  Tell me.
First thing we're gonna work on is the mannerisms.  Alan has put together sort of a training program
The Washington Post.
Nightmare...
Look... at some point we're going to have to call the Vice President...
Like how?
Mild stroke?
What about her.
Her?... Oh -- the First Lady...  She was giving that commencement speech up in Bryn Mawr.  I managed to catch her before she left the hotel.
And...
What about the wife?
Check his kids.
I don't want him caring about his wife! What about the Vice President!
Alan, we still have to control this guy...
What are you gonna do?
I heard you.  You said 'cut three hundred million dollars from the federal budget, and you can keep your homeless shelter.'
I'll lock him away for good.
Uh-oh...
It's fine.
I gotta tell ya, Dave.  I've been going over this a bunch of times and a lot of this stuff just doesn't add up.  Who does these books?
I just think they make this stuff a lot more complicated than it has to be.
Well... I gues I would... Yeah.
I don't think so.
What?
President vetoes works bill?
Yes, Mr. President?
No,  sir.  It's more of a perceptual issue.
What do you mean?
Really?
No.
I was waiting for that jack.
First thing they teach you at the academy.  `Don't give me gold and silver, or other worldly things, just the pride and glory of bleeding for my King.'
Who?
Well...
You bet.
I saw the light.  I thought maybe you were up.
I mean, what is it?  Another Secretary? A jaunt to the Bahamas with Some 'campaign worker.'  Where is he?
You don't have to keep walking with me.   I'm okay from here.
You mean when I'm not running the country?
Yeah.  Is that funny?
It's just more than anybody else does around here.
Hi.
What about the intro?
Father Mclntire.   He blessed you at the inauguration.
Please....shoot me.
Help me get him to the boat.
Listen, Missy. I am the only due process that has ta be served aroun' tyere and one of the people doin' the servin' from now on is gonna be you. Now you been prancin' aroun' the Cave like yer ass was glass fer long enough! All that's
That sounds like a curse to me.
Oh, what did I run into? A bunch o' Jesus nuts? Religiosos? Prayer won't stop a bullet from one of those storm troopers and prayer won't keep one of those monsters from eatin' your liver for lunch.
That's why we didn't use prayers on this here white coat 'til after he was destroyed. We ready to fight when we have to. And we gotta fight now.
Datura Metel. The Devil's Trumpet. Don't worry. I ain't goin' religioso again. It's a flower that grows on these islands. Where I come from the voodoo priests used it whenever they needed a Mickey Finn. It's toxic. Ground up you can put it in a drink or inject it...or...in a sealed area it might be introduced through the ventilation system.
That entrance is closest to the labs and the Bee cages.
He is dying. He knows it.
Come, come, Miss Science. You've seen worse.
Sir. In the matter of the State versus Private Tyler, I don't want to...
I want you to leave. Then maybe...
It will?  How do you figure?
Needs Chris!  Must have Chris!
But what if they see it, Nuwanda?
Anything else you'd care to rifle through, Mr. Dalton?
Yeah!    Don't you guys miss having girls here?
"O, no, it is an ever-fixed mark That looks on tempests and is never shaken; It is the star to every wandering bark whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken."
Yes sir.  We were just talking about that.
Welton Academy, hello?  Yes, he is, just a moment.  Mr. Nolan, it's for you.
What is this "Dead Potts Society"?  I want names.
Yeah, chemistry.  My father thought I should get ahead.
Well, Meeks aced Latin and I didn't quite flunk English so if you want, we've got our study group.
Sure.
You still shouldn't have done it, Charlie.  You don't speak for the club.
This is stupid.
It does?  What?
Hello?
Ginny Danburry's here.  Look for her.
Chris!
Knox, why are you doing this to me?
I promise.  Dead Poets honor.  Come with me tonight, then if you don't want to see me again, I swear I'll bow out.
What is that?
What is wrong with old habits, Mr. Overstreet?
John, the curriculum here is set.  It's proven.  It works.  If you question it, what's to prevent them from doing the same?
Stretch it, pull it, it will never cover any of us.  Kick at it, beat at it, it will never be enough-
I was just looking in an old annual and...
Ah, but I am seeing the world, Neil. The new world.  Seeing a student like you take root and bloom.  It's worth everything.  That's why I came back here. A place like this needs at least one teacher like me.  Did you come here to talk about my teaching?
Well, if it's more than a whim, then you'll have to prove that to him.  You'll have to show him with your passion and commitment that it's what you really want to do.  If that doesn't work, at least by then you'll be eighteen and able to do what you want.
Give your father the benefit of the doubt.  Talk to him.  Let him see who you are.
Isn't there an easier way?
You know what the dead poets would say: Gather ye rosebuds while ye may...
His grades are hurting, Charlie.
If you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost.  That is where they should be.  Now put foundations under them.
I gotta get to the tryouts.  Wish me luck.
Nobody-  I thought I'd surprise you. I've got all As and-
What?
Look, Todd, you're obviously under- estimating the value of this desk set.
This play?
No thanks.
How do we get out of here?
I once saw a guy put a fish in a bottle, then he corked it, sealing it tight, and threw it to a baby octopus. The little sucker felt its way around that bottle, and in less than two minutes, got that cork off, slid inside, and ate that fish.
Now look what you did!
I saved your life is what I did!
Quite a few.
Like cattle...
What's the matter?
What is it?
It's not them...it's it...
I don't take orders at all.
So...If the hull's impregnable why are my feet wet?
...Jagger was here...I was here...
Sure I do...I give a shit that at 0300 hour we reach our point of dentination. I give a shit that those mojos got to do what they got to do, and 45 minutes later we are turn around and gone. I give a shit that by the time the sun comes up we are all safely tucked in bed.
Joey...
It's okay...come on...
I don't know...you got what we need?
Fuel up. Need fuel.
Those are mine!
What?
John,we're going huntin'.
It's Nick!
I know, but...
It won't open.
Whee-uu!
Well, where the hell is he!!! I mean what are we all sitting here for!!!  WHAT THE HELL IS THIS???
You're back.
I have to go.
Linda, yeah.
No.
Merle? That's who we're looking for. Merle.
Sure! I got eight hundred potatoes says he goes one more... He retired, you know.
No. How's Angela? How's she taking it?
I would want to pay you, Nick... and I was thinking --
What?
Okay.
Sure.
I thought... Oh, Nick, I thought you were hurt, some accident. Maybe you fell or maybe some car...  I thought someone stole you away!
Fine. I just go along, you know. Down at the market. Back here. I mean it just seems there's a million things to do!... Are you sure you're all right? I mean, what about the wound?
But --
How's the trailer?
No. No, no.
That way it sets.
So do I.
I don't think about the shot that much.
Hell no!
You think we'll ever come back?
Hey, Nick?
Tomorrow I go with Vince.
Forget Sal?
Forget Sal... Listen to me -- forget Sal! I've been working on Sal since dawn, Nick. Sal's in a dream and he won't come out. LISTEN!!! From here on you gotta go for you. You hear me? For you!
More bullets in the gun... The trouble is that still leaves one of us with his hands tied up, so that means we gotta play each other.
No. No way!
I like it, Nick.
Sure I got boots. I got boots right here.
Right.
Same. Hey. Same old stuff.
Great. Hey. That's great.
I'm gonna stay here, Nick.
Trip? What do you mean, Nick? You said you'd be --
Hey, Nick, you ever do it with one of those slants?
What the hell was that!  What did you think? Did you think it was loaded!
Down.
What'cha got, Bennett?
Jesus.  Sweet Jesus.  We've got trouble.
Talk fast.  Polls open in half an hour.
He just wants me to make him cinnamon cookies like I made for you.
You helped set up my partner, Sergeant William Wade.  I want to know who put you up to it.
I was set up and you know it... but you swore under oath I was dirty. You helped bury me.
You son-of-a-bitch.  How do you stop it?
Just got the call.  Took him from school.  Bastard nailed the Vice- Principal and a teacher.
I heard about today.  Good job.  I'm all for capital punishment.  Why don't you go home and see your family?
But sir, Sergeant Wade saved the hostages.
Yes.
Does it drive itself, too?
Whoa.  Don't touch that.  <u>Pursuit</u> <u>Mode</u>.  Auto pilot.  Computerized steering and driving system used in high speed pursuits.  Installed Fall 2006.  Underground rumor has it they modeled it after you, sir.
No offense, but why'd they partner me with a rookie?
You're saying you were put away for a crime you didn't commit?
It doesn't make sense.  Who would want to do that to you?
Engaged.  Plan on doing it this summer.  You still married?
You need anything else?
Maybe I should turn myself in.
You're not pregnant, are you?
Wallet, cash, I.D...
You okay?
This is the guy that killed my partner.
You startin' a fan club or some- thin'?
He went dirty and they made an example of him.
But he was such a good cop.
They always are.
Funny.  Would you like to buy me a drink?
You could always take it off.
You're lying.
Young man -- you got me there.
A varied list of attractions. And which would you like to see first, Dan'l?
And what about Daniel Webster?
Sure am.
Why, thank you, Tom. I was going to ask you if you thought I could.
Afraid ... of what?
Yes, why shouldn't it?
No, no! Give it to me!
The seventh day of April --
Jabez Stone -- did you or did you not sign this document?
Seems like it's my fault, Mr. Webster.
That's just fine, Neighbor Stone -- but -- I have to be pretty careful of my seats of honor -- where I sit, I mean. You see, the whole country sort of has its eye on me, Jabez -- anybody in public life has that difficulty -- even you, Jabez. They watch us carefully, our neighbors and our enemies, and they see much more than we think they do -- and understand much more. My friends all like to think that I've got the good of mankind always at heart, and I've got to make sure that those I deal with have the good of mankind always at heart, too. Do you know what I'm talking about, Jabez?
Contracts? -- Yes, they have contracts with me -- lots of 'em -- but -- but that's all right. Without me and my money, they wouldn't have anything.
There's no joy in it for me.
Why of course --
Well -- yes --
You are not so sure that he'll come.
He's stubborn as a Stone.
Jabez -- you ought to talk to Tom about joining the Grange.
There is nothing to worry about now.
Mary --
Mary, get three cups of camomile tea for the Squire and the rest. They all feel colds coming on.
Yes, Mr. Selectman!
No, no. I don't want to be idle.
Jabez -- how can you let her talk like that when the boy is present? He won't respect me any more.
It shows on your face.
Consarn the consarn --
I dunno.
And why should I? Let him howl if it makes him feel good.  Consarn it. He's better off than I am! I wish I could tell Him...  ... up there, just what I think.
Yes -- I was getting the seed -- I stumbled -- I saw one of the boards warped up a bit -- and -- there it was.
Well -- that's comforting!  Supper.
Why, that's just sense, Son. Now a man like Daniel Webster -- guess they pay him high for what he does. But he's worth it -- and he helps others. Makes all the difference.
I know, Ma, but -- Suppose a man got his money in bad ways --
What's that you say, Son?
Now, Ma -- You just try to set an example for me, and keep hold of yourself.
So you've made up your mind to go to the party.
Well, Martin, I only wear them in Washington -- that's the trouble. But if you ever come down there, I'll show them to you.
You see, I don't care if we are rich or poor -- I don't care if we're big or small, all I care about is Jabez. He was the first man I loved. He never used to care about money -- we were poor as Job's turkey, but none of us minded. Now I've seen him drive the poor from the door, and we used to be poor ourselves. I've seen him get hard and mean, and he isn't hard or mean. I've heard him mock at the church bells -- the bells that rang for our wedding. That's not like him, Mr. Webster -- It must be my fault somehow -- my fault.
Mary -- what love and trust could do for your husband, you've done. And frankly, in a very few moments, this is going to be no place for a lady.
I'd rather see you on the side of the opposition.
Well, I never heard the dev-- of your claiming American citizenship.
Why don't you?
The girl was off today.  Hey, I didn't expect you to sit up front.  So, your lady live out here?
She had a good job, it turned into a great career.
Like I said, Argyle...you're fast.
Dwayne Robinson, LAPD.  I'm in charge here.
Where are you going?
John, I think you could get with the program a little.  The police are here now.  It's their problem. Tell these guys where the detonators are so no one else gets hurt.  Hey, I'm putting my life on the line for you buddy...
The code key, please...?
One weekend I went to a combat ranch...  You know, that game with the, the guns that shoot red paint?  Must sound pretty silly to you...
Whoa, Hans, now you're the cowboy?
Then there's no reason not to tell it to us.
How do you know?
I still feel like shit.
Roy?
I am, Sir...Sergeant Al Powell.
Then who the hell have you been talking too?
What about the body that fell out of the window -- ?
Don't let 'em off the ground.
The robbers in the bank.  They got guns?
I'll kiss the baby for you.
Yeah, well I don't blame him.
That's why I can talk to you, as an equal, Sonny.  You got to merge your whole soul with God.  And then you are Him and one with the Holy Ghost.
What do you mean... what am I talking about?  Do you realize that you say that to me every day of your life?  I am dying.  Do you know... do you realize the death that you are spreading around to the people who are around you?
I don't know what I'm doing.
I know that.  I'm warped... I'm warped!
I know I am.  I know!
Would you do something for me? Please?
Yeah.
You don't have a choice?
All right, enough!  Who the fuck is on the phone... anyway?  Is that you Moretti?  You on the phone?  Will somebody talk to me?
Yeah... huh, thank you.  I'm going to go back, Sonny, to the hospital. They're really nice people.  They're really trying to help me.
That's good then.  You've found something.
He needed money?  For the operation for you?
I'm afraid.
I'm not alone.
Give me a name, any name, just so I got somethin' to call you.
Listen, Sonny ... can I call you Sonny for short?
How about letting the people out of the bank.  Why put them in this position?
You want me to give up, huh?  Look, Sal's in back with the girls. Anything happens to me - one move - and Sal gives it to them.  Boom boom.  How do I know you won't jump me?
He wanted to kill me!
No, I'm not tryin' to fuck you.
Sonny, your wife's on the way ... We reached her ... your wife's on the way ... everything you asked for, you got.
All right ... I got some hungry people in there ... I want to get some pizza ... some stuff like that ...
Is he all right?  Is he all right?
We're all set at Kennedy.
Hello... I'm sorry I can't talk to you right now... I suggest you call during banking hours tomorrow. What is your name?
Howard, give him the keys...
The gun's right on your back...
Let's go to the back door.  How'd that guy get to be a guard?
I'm okay ... I'm okay ...
You tell me.  Is he endangering his health, because if you tell me he is, I'll get him out.
They're like any others but they're special to me.  You got kids?  You told me; you got two.
Would I hire you?
What is it, Sam?
Because I'm scared, that's why. You never smoked?
You're serious!
Hey, for christ's sake... now... fuckin' asshole...  He can't make it.
Ah, Jesus...
... The bodies out the door.
Maybe we can get outta this thing alive ... get 'em to drop the kidnapping charges ...
Wyoming.
Yeah ...
Aw, Jesus ... you been doin' us favors all night!
Wait a minute!  What the fuck you tryin' to tell me?
Oh, shit!  I gotta have time to think.
What is it?  Did you just barge in here... He doesn't have plan.  It's all a whim.  'Rob a bank!  What not?'
Fuck!  We did it!
Mom - they're sending a bus to take us to the airport.  You understand? If you're here - they're not gonna send it.  They'll think I'm gonna come out with you.
What's wrong with that?  The FBI was very understanding when I explained it to him.  Everybody knows it isn't you ... It's the pressures from your home life.
She doesn't have anything to do with it!  You understand that? Mother?  This is me!
Alright. Time to ditch this thing. Did you take a look at the bathroom window?
<i>We gotta bring him in.</i>
Fella could get used to a life this ordinary.
I just charged $12.95 to our room for that movie. Now I'll never know how the story ends.

It could be anything. You're going to discover a whole new world when you get to school.
I know I am, Mom.
Don't we want them to talk to us?
How nerdy is that? I'm wearing two pairs right now.
Can we eat there tomorrow?
Oh, yeah. Well I almost always beat Captain Rob.
Whoa. What was that?
I can't help my heart. And when I'm your dad, you'll have to do as I say.
When you live in the basement of the school, you breathe in a lot of chalk dust. It writes out all the answers on your brain.  Now how about a slushee?

I don't know. Owwww.
...cause you said...
Our own special bus.
Nope. I was right.
Uh oh. Captain Rob's always been my partner.
Who cares? Chicks are for fags.
I think she wants me to come over to put me into the right position to check out her delicates, what ever that means.
She wants me to stay for dinner, I don't know what to say to her.
Sure, I like a woman with some meat on her bones.
But-
Good one, Captain Rob. He does look like a you-know-what.
You certainly did.
Ya know Harry, I think this whole experience has soured me on women.
Hold up. First, we have to decide who gets who, remember? No more competition?
I'm not interested. Not after the smear story you did on my chicken sushi.
So can I come along?
I thought I told you to get lost.
Yes, what?
Well I was born in St. Louis.
Checking up on my friend, Harry.
What?
Uh, thanks. God I'm so excited! So, are you ready to take me to the principal's office? He whips out the key, she takes it.
No, it was a complete waste of time.
He's going to be in jail for a long time.
Can you believe it?
Hello, little orphan boy. What happened to you?
Obviously.
Sure you can. We gotta nail this guy. You'll be fine.
How baby-cakes? You've done it all.
Times two.
And...?
Guess what"s under these coconuts.
The chest! The chest that I put my papers in.
The documents. The photos! The tapes! The evidence.
JESSICA. Are you sure?
Are you going to kill her?
So the chest is still out there somewhere.
What does Leto say, Piter?
I prefer the more ancient term, planetologist... Noble Born.
We felt his presence.
He will not permit anyone but me to see him. You must be outside this room.... Do what you can.

Really?
I never thought of that.
Do you want me to get it for you?
Eddie, you got a new movie for me?!
Well, It's about how people have two personalities.  The side they show to the world, and then the secret person they hide inside.

Ed, you're still young.  This is the part of your life when you're <u>supposed</u> to be struggling.
You got the job?!!
Oh, the hell with you.  I met BELA LUGOSI!
How can you just walk around like that, in front of all these people?
Ed, who is Daniel Davis?
It was the only way I could get the movie made!
That's Tony McCoy.  He's playing Lieutenant Dick Craig.
Oh really?  How much money did he put up?
None.  But his dad gave me fifty grand.
Pleased to meet you.  I'm Loretta King.
I understand you just moved here?
So my associate Mr. Marco tells me you may be interested in investing in a motion picture.
Eddie, which dress do you like better?
What are you looking at me like that for?  I already gave you my three hundred.
Really?!  Well good for you.
Screen Classics?  Hmm, don't know them.
You could say that --
Graverobbers from <u>what</u>??
And PERFECT.  CUT!
Tor.  Have you ever thought about becoming an actor?
And they always want to cast their buddies -- it doesn't even <u>matter</u> if they're right for the part!
Ed!  What's with these revised pages?!  A scene in a smelting factory?  A buffalo stampede?? <u>Three-hundred soldiers storming Anzio</u> <u>Beach</u>??!  What's going on here?  I can't afford to film this nonsense!
Gee, I used every frame of film we shot.  Maybe they won't notice.
But I'm proud.  I wrote, directed, and starred in it just like Orson Welles in "Citizen Kane"!
Oh.  Congratulations.
No.  I'm from back east.  You know, All-American small town... everybody knew everybody, I was a Boy Scout, my dad worked for the post office...
Ed, this spaghetti sauce is delicious.
Well you tried --
You know, when you rewrite a script, it just gets better and better!
Those assholes.
<u>Right now</u>.  Let's drive to Vegas!
Excuse me, Miss Vampira?
I don't understand.  Do you want my autograph?
Please!  It'll only take a minute. You can have some hors d'oeuvres, and meet my backers!  There's a really nice dentist from Oxnard...
I'm really sorry...
I know what <u>that's</u> like.  Anyway, I brought a copy of the script.  You would play the "Ghoul's Wife."
Look... would it be possible to make the "Ghoul's Wife" a little less prominent, so people won't really notice me in the movie?
I suppose.  It's very expensive.
What are you, an angora wholesaler?
Please, be compassionate.  I'm your husband!
Do they show it?
At what point?
She's in the kitchen. I'd yell for her, but I'd die.  You had a busy night last night.
Did you see that?
Yeah only I wish they had the sister on more.
Excuse me.
Can I give you one bit of advice? About Shari?
Thank you. Can I see her?
I'm gonna stick this right in your eye.
I was at this comedy club last week and this comedian says "If you're over thirty and your job requires you to wear a name tag, you screwed up your life." And I'm laughing and then I realize I wear a nametag.
When? Today?
Right, right...
So he killed himself.
I don't want to -- do you know where he is?
Both.
He had girlfriends!
Why? How...
But Al is your husband now!
What is she, at work?
I can't?
Look, if you don't let me out of this... I'11 just... I'11 just sit in my apartment all day. I won't go anywhere, I won't do anything. What kind of show will that be?
No! I barely even mentioned -it's just that, my friends, the people at work, whoever I'm regularly in contact with they want releases from.
Why do it?
I saw this show once. It was about logging. I was home sick, there was nothing else on. Do you know how they break up really bad log jams? You know, when they're really tangled... ?
It's... okay
You should see the one we wear when it rains.
Who cares? I don't ca -- No. I do care.  Shame on everybody. Shame on you! Well, just the seventy-one percent. The other... 
So?
Oh Je -- couldn't he sleep with Rita? We'11 all have a good time.
I'm sorry.
Come on, let's go.
What do you want me to do? You want me to quit the show?!
Ray borrowed this whole tub of money against this balloon payment that I don't get if I qu -- it's too complicated. I -- Besides...
This is going right up your ass.
I ... I'm not gonna do it.
No, this is great.  You'll love this.  He's a singer.
Richie!  She spent six months dating a criminal
Uh, no, uh I'm a little tired. I fell asleep.
Yeah.
Oh, man, I've been trying to call you.
No -- keep it.
-- That we were doing "together." I finished it. It came out great! Because no one was standing over my shoulder bothering me - "That's too much glue. You're using too much glue."
Ohhh...
What would I actually have to do to get you to sign this?
pierdes.
A few months before the election, she'd had an affair with my best friend Dave Novotny.
No, I'm not. I'm just really busy.
Come on, doit. Doit. Fill me up. Come on, fill me up
You're kidding, right?
He's right. Two people must have pocketed their ballots. Usually it's more.
Aren't you supposed to keep them?
Thanks for everything.
Okay. That's good. I just wanted to make sure.
I guess you know why you're here
Mr. M., I am running on my qualifications.  I would never need to resort to, you know, to vandalism like a, you know... Plus, my own best banner was torn down.  Did I do that too?
I was.  So?  Mr. Pecharda let me in. As you know, with all my responsibilities I often come in on the weekend and have permission to do so. But I left very early, around 6:30.
Okay, Tracy, so who do you think did it?  Whom should we "interrogate?"
Plenty of pep, too.
Uh, Jim?
Possibly.  Please just wait outside.
So... what do you have to tell me?
More this way.
Oh, come on.  You've had a hard year, you're cooped up with the kid all the time.  Let go; live a little.
Yep.
Right now?
A mistake?  That was no mistake.
I was lonely.  You took advantage
But you've got a big choice right now. You can choose to be depressed about it for the rest of your life. Or you can choose to see it for what it really is: an opportunity.  I personally think you have a big future ahead of you, and I don't mean the fleeting glory of sports.
Paul, what's your favorite fruit?
Paul... Paul.... We'll have plenty of time to get into all this later.  A whole year, in fact. Right now I just need to finish my pie and get home.
No way I It doesn't make sense.
I know.
She's doing this to get back at me
For what?
For what?
We still have some extra ones, don't we?  Maybe we can just --
Who put you up to this?
So Mr. McAllister asked you to run.
Way to go, Tracy!  Isn't this exciting?
Yeah.  Oh, one more thing. Tammy. You know, all this election stuff. 'Cause, you know, everyone is saying it's so weird that you're running against me, and, well, it is kind of weird, and you haven't really told me why you're doing it and didn't tell me in advance or anything.  But that's okay, you know.  l respect your privacy.  I just want you to know that no matter who wins, if it's you or me, there's no hard feelings. We're still brother and sister.  Okay? Cause... and I hope you feel the same.
Sure, Paul.  No hard feelings.
You wanna get me a fuckin' snitch jacket?
Tell me about Patchett.
You look better than Veronica Lake.  Now, <u>Pierce Patchett</u>.
You have your extracurricular secrets, I have mine.  We'll hold a clarification session soon.  For now, I need your fearsome old habits at the Victory Motel. We're going to brace a man who may know who killed Jack Vincennes. Can I count on you?
Don't look so down in the mouth, Bud.  You nailed him good.
What are you talking about?
Where are we going?
What happened?
Stensland and Meeks.  What were they up to?
Bud...
That's right.
Why were Lefferts' eyes black?
Whose shoe?
If she was sitting here, then it's facing the wrong way.  What are these smears in the blood?
It looks like she was flailing, trying to get away.
Cotton balls.  I found them just inside the meat locker door.
What do you mean?
I got the rap sheets on the black guys, sir.  Coates and Jones got charges a mile long.  But except for some kid stuff, Fontaine's clean.
You're twenty-two, aren't you, Ray?
That fucking Larry.  I almost believed him.
Ray, you protected Ty and Larry up in Casitas, didn't you?
Why were you throwing clothes in the building incinerator?
But you were business associates?
That was his favorite toast.  I saw the test results on the lieutenant's exam.  You placed first out of twenty-three.
You're wrong.
Am I...?  Would you be willing to plant corroborative evidence on a suspect you knew was guilty in order to ensure an indictment?
Answer yes or no.
Would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorney's working hypothesis...?  Yes or no, Edmund.
No.
No.
I know you mean well, Dudley, but I don't need to do it the way you did.  Or my father.
White's a mindless thug.
Yes, Dudley.  I am.
Two minutes, Dudley.  It's important.
Twelve years ago he worked a vice roust with Dick Stensland.  They arrested a Pierce Patchett on an extortion scam.  Guy ran hookers. He'd have them photographed with their johns, then double-dip for some blackmail.  Charges got dropped.  Insufficient evidence. You were supervising officer on the case and I was wondering if you remember anything about it.
Have you discussed this with anyone else, John?
<u>Throwing me</u>?
It's a simple question.
Rita Hayworth at the morgue and now Veronica Lake with White. What the hell's going on?
High line whores.  With plastic surgery to look like movie stars. And who knows what else?  It's run by this guy Pierce Patchett.  You want to talk to him?
She is Lana Turner.
What are you going to do?
Is the Veronica Lake look-alike one of your whores?
I work for Patchett.  I had a feeling that there was someone else, but I never knew who.
Right now, before I back down.
Do you think I ever could've been in the running?
The proof had his throat slit.  So far you're not denying it.
Okay!  You're right!  Dudley's got photos of me and Reynolds.
Let my Susie rest in peace!
Officer White?
It's Christmas morning in the City of Angels, and while decent citizens sleep the sleep of the righteous, hopheads prowl for marijuana, not knowing that a man is coming to stop them.  The free- wheeling, big-time Big V, celebrity crime-stopper, Jack Vincennes, the scourge of grasshoppers and junk fiends everywhere.  You like it, Jackie- Boy?
No.  But I've got something going with Ad Vice.
Something good?
You tight with the D.A., trash?
Around.
Was it a party?
It'll be our secret.
Gee.  The Great Jerk-Off Book Caper of 1953.
Brill?
I just gave him my card.
I don't know what that means.
Turn on CNN.
You've got it on tape?
Clear as day.
No one. But I'm a little nervous.
Come straight here. Don't talk to anyone.
I'll come straight there.
It is?
What do they have to do with this?
Why don't they just identify themselves and tell me what they want?
They're spooks.
Hey, if you live another week I'll be impressed.
What if--
I taped it off the 11 o'clock news.
I mean did you call anyone.
I called my wife!
Why'd you leave?
It was '72. I figured we had enough problems without monitoring a Berkeley kid's class schedule. So I sold my story to <u>Ramparts</u> and split.
Those are Feds.
That wasn't so hard.
Drive.
What if--
What if we just fucked with 'em?
What do you know about locking cellular phone signals?
Feeling lucky?
Is Jerry Delsano in?
Well, sir, I'm afraid it's not as simple as that. Your average newspaper guy or Hard Copy lady or whatever, they can't buy this stuff.
I'm married to my wife...of several years...and I'd like to buy...as a Christmas present...
It's okay. I think it's a wonderful gift.
I'll be right back.
Why?
Because my life is being ruined.
I didn't want to bother you during your racquetball game.
Than why can't you tell me.
Because I don't know.
Why so edgy, Mr. Dean?
Was he with anyone?
I don't know what's goin' on with Zavitz, but that was way, <u>way</u> outa line.  You understand?
You should take this seriously.
Stacy?
You had an affair with this woman, Robert, we went to a fucking <u>counselor</u> for a year.
Stacy, don't hang up.
Do you know what I'm looking at Robert?
I'm looking at a picture of you and Rachel taken <u>yesterday</u>.
Is Eric in school?
This is my house. Nobody's kicking me out of my house. I picked those drapes.
Does that hurt?
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.
I don't believe it is, no.
That's probably not you in the picture. I tell you what, I'll just run the thing by the Grand Jury, see if they can't--
Brill.
Brill?
He doesn't work that way.
Good. You're just what I need right now.
You got a minute?
I'm gonna fix it.
Fuck you. When you needed information, I got it. You didn't care how.
Hey!
Listen--
I got a call this morning from a source I trust. The Post is running a lead this afternoon about your involvement in the Bellmoth investigation.
A leave of absence. Until we've sorted this all out.
I'm sorry, Mr. Dean. But Larry's in St. Lukes now, so I'm a little--I'm not myself. The Union bosses say unless we take Bellmoth's offer, it'll only get worse.
That's because your Union bosses <u>are</u> those Guido mother-fuckers.
The Union's trying to railroad you into accepting terms worse than what you have now.
No. We're never getting a divorce. We were having a fight. It happens sometimes.
How long can you stay?
I love my blender.
Go to 'em, Jerry.
Bobby? Piece of advice?
Bobby--
I'm not asking you to say for certain. This is what you're trained to do, right?
He never made it to the newspaper, but there was private sector contact.
He had help.
Lyle?!
Not yet. He's near "M" and 34th. I've got an ELSUR unit on the scene now. A residential building. Twelve units.
You have any idea what kind of position this--
It was pulsing on your SAT frequencies.
No.
Which stall?
Excuse me?
I don't want to go back.
This is an incredible story - about a man hunting an Ostrich, he's been telling me about Zerzura, he thinks he's been there, but his map, the route he's describing, he couldn't survive the journey now, but he's a poet, so his map is poetry - and now we're onto an Ostrich.  I'm telling her your map is poetry. The Arab shrugs.
I do not.
See what's happening to them - the stars.
- there is the Harmattan, a red wind. Which Mariners called the sea of darkness.  Red sand from this wind has flown as far as the south coast of England, producing showers so dense they were mistaken for blood. Almasy checks to see if Katharine is still awake.
Madox will have calculated how many miles, they'll soon turn around.
Could I ask you, please, to paste you paintings into my book?  I should like to have them.  I should be honored.
Mrs. Clifton - Katharine turns, disgusted.
A woman should never learn to sew, and if she can she should never admit to it.  Close your eyes.
Now.
This is a different world - is what I tell myself.  A different life. And here I am a different wife.
I just wanted you to know. I'm not missing you yet. She nods, can't find this funny.
Why did you hold his collar?
What?  What?  That boy, that little boy, you were holding his collar, gripping his collar, what for?
Don't do this.
It hurts too much.
Don't you know you drove everybody mad?
Don't talk.
I know.  I'm sorry.  I'll make a fire. I'll be back.
Shall we be all right?
I'm sorry, Katharine.
A broken car?
Her hands and feet were tied.
Look, either shut up, or go home.
How are you?
It is you.  This was taken in Cairo at British Headquarters - July 41. And so was this - August 41.  And this -February 42.
I understand you were in Africa. Whereabouts?
And you've forgotten yours.
Have a drink.
What?  You and Madox?  Or you and Katharine Clifton?
Hana tells me you're leaving.
And you thought you'd come and settle the score?
Oh.
Geoffrey, you do so love putting on a disguise.
What was all the banging?  Were you fighting rats or the entire German army?
Are you remembering more?
Are you crazy?
Your friend?
He's going back to the front this evening.  I can't see him otherwise.
That's a different dress.
Could I ask you to move?  I'm sorry - but when you turn, the sheets, I can't really bear the sheets moving over me. Sorry.
We should charge!  Doesn't anyone have a job to do?
You like him, don't you?  Your voice changes.
You'd better be.
Never heard of it.
It's okay - I'll help.  Please.
Why would anyone do this?
Actually, you can't cut, can you? You'll fall over.  Give me the pliers.
This is hot!
Is that what you think?  Is that what you think I think?
I've clung to you.  I've clung to you. Kip.  Life  a raft.
He can't even move.
He's gone, hasn't he?
I was going to say - if you want to eat with us, ever… you and Lieutenant Singh…
You saved my life.  I haven't forgotten.  I thought you were very very tall. You seemed to big - a Giant - and I felt like a child who can't keep her balance.
I was looking for the Lieutenant Singh.
Pardon me?
I've got a surprise.  A boat!  We can go to Capri.  It's got a cabin, it's private.
I'd like to spend a night with you in a bed.
Why?  Are you German?
You got a better idea?
Look, trust me. I know what I'm doing.
It was only a scratch. Far more damaging to my trousers than to me.
Of course you wouldn't. The Rembrandt wouldn't fit.
No. Why would I be?
For God's sake.
Somewhat better than that temple scroll you were bidding on.
But Roki said--
You want me to pick up a painting?
He says they turned the card down.
I don't believe this.
Only a week?
So you're testing <u>me</u> now?
I had a lifeline. If I've got a lifeline, I'm okay.
Camera in the--
Popup, on floorboards. And--
Don't turn. I'm counting the steps to the entrance.
We did it.
You're playing both sides of the street. You're going to keep the Mask and turn me in.
Yes. Yes.
It's your mistake.
What?
We're living history here.
I'll need the Rembrandt now.
Okay, look, I'm delivering this to a man who's going to give us the key to our job. But it's pointless to try to explain it yet. You just have to trust me. I don't have any more secrets.
A parting gift from the Empire.
Not for me.
China will think it happened before midnight. Britain will swear it happened after midnight...
MOVE IT, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING F...
Come on.
No way.
Take the airport subway, but change at Jordan Station for Kowloon Tong.
It's only ninety seconds up the line. You're on a connection to a trans Siberian express.
I'm not real big on collecting banged up Ferraris at airports.
This is big enough.
Let me ask you, this Mask, when they made it--was the old bitch dead or alive?
You look like George Washington.
She's good. Give her that. Almost as good as she thinks she is.
You'll just have to have faith.
Thought you had to use some of these.
... what we do in here is keep track of all the case files.  That way, at any time, we can find out a case's status -- where it is in the office, stuff like that.  We file 'em all here, alphabetically --
In terms of land value out in Hinkley, Mr. Masry, we feel it's a more than fair price.
Tony Marvin.
Which one?
There's more than one?
So you say.
I added air conditioning, put in the pool, made all those pillows by hand ...
You wouldn't happen to have a little time right now, would you, Donna?
I can put them in a good school.
... just wanna be a good mom, a nice person, a decent citizen.  Just wanna take good care of my kids.  You know?
You never called me back.  I left messages.
You said things would be fine, and they're not.
All I have is hundreds.
Yeah.  I got it.  No problem.
I left a message.  I've been dealing with that real estate thing.  I was gonna write up a whole damn report and --
So what made you think it was?
Okay.  A 5% raise, and --
Okay, so here's what I'll do.  I'll go on up to Ted and Rita Daniels -- two of the nicest people you'd ever hope to meet, who spend every single day watching their little girl fight like a dog against this cancer -- I'll tell them we can't help them cause you don't feel like working that hard.
Kinda like David and what's-his-name?
What now?
And that's what caused the contamination?
You didn't care about my case?
He said he'd be at the gas station at six.
What kind of things come up?
No one's taking anything --
Don't give me that.  You've gotten plenty. You've been well-paid; you've gotten lots of perks ...
And if you had to guess ...
When?  Where?
Say you'd be the luckiest son of a bitch on Earth if I didn't up and quit over all this.
How many counts?
I've also been thinking about the team. Responsibilities, who should cover what --
How come you didn't say anything when you found these things?
I guess I did.
Nope.  Maiden.
You know what, Erin?  I got nothing but time here.  Why don't you let me do that for you, and you can get your kids some dinner.
Hey, Ross.  Tell me something.  Does PG&E pay you to cover their ass, or do you just do it out of the kindness of your heart?
Hunh-uh.  What's that?
Look, I know you're mad.  But the way this job is, things come up at the last minute, real important things, and I gotta deal with them.  Now I don't like me missing dinner any more than you do, but we're all gonna have to get used to it, cause the fact is, it's gonna happen sometimes.
We'll see.
You always say that.  Then you go to work and forget you promised.
I said, <u>whose number do you need</u>?
You want my number?
Which number do you want, George?
Why not?
Great.  Another deadbeat.
Then lemme remind you, the polite thing is to say, thank you, that's a real nice offer, I don't mind taking you up on it.
Thanks for reminding me.
I <u>can't</u> call an exterminator.  I can't afford one.  God, I can't even afford my <u>phone</u>.  I got fired.
You're not nothing, Erin.
One toy per kid is doing something nice. Four is ... something else.
I'm just saying --
Come on, Erin.  A job's supposed to pay your bills, not put you in danger.
Cause I can get a job.  I will.  And you can start leaving the kids with the chicken fat lady again.  Would that make you happy?
What do you want, a joke?
What's that?
I can't leave my job, George.
I don't do favors for you anymore.
They up?
It's just -- the pain.  It's only getting worse.  I can't be a good wife.  I can't be a good mother.
-- toothbrush, toothpaste, and a pair of hose.  Here.
What's going on?
Yes?
Oh.  Oh.
Right, I guess those are the kids --
But Han and Leia will surely die.
Barks his concern.
We should have stayed and finished them off.
... the power?
Okay, Chewie, it's now or never.
No, no!  I'll stay and help you find your friend.
Look, it smells good.  I'm sure it's delicious   But I don't know why we can't see Yoda now.
Our situation is most precarious. We have a new enemy who could bring about our destruction.
Thank you, General.  But there's a price on my head.  If I don't pay off Jabba the Hutt, I'm a walking dead man.
Wait.  I'll send a patrol with you.
He doesn't make sense to me either, Chewie.
Transport XJ. get out of here. Go!
Yes, Your Highness?
Not you?
You must have gone completely out of your feeble mind.
Let's hope so ... it's just the chance we need.
To get killed ... you're not seriously going into an asteroid field?
Easy, your worship.  Only trying to help.
Looks like some kind of Mynock.
No lightspeed?
You could have warned him before you shut him off.
Oh, so sorry!  Didn't mean to offend your droid.  You think braking and shutting down in that amount of time is easy?
You do have your moments ... Not many, but you do have them.
Thanks to you.
Repairs ...
Get out of here, Lando!
Don't shoot!  I've done what I can for you.  I'm sorry it's not better, but I've got my own problems.  I've already stuck my neck out further than I should ...
We only use this chamber for carbon freezing.  If you put him in there, it'll kill him.
Thanks.
I'm coming over to your side, that's what.  And I have a feeling I'm making a big mistake.
We have no use for your kind.
What?
No argument, just do it.  That's a command!
Is there any chance of them surviving out there?
What??
I could get more loyalty if I went down the hall and recruited some of those snow creatures.
I can't. It's too big.
That they are.
Ben?  Ben?
Yes, yes.  To Obi-wan you listen young one.  The tree.  Remember your failure at the tree!  Heh?
The Zoo tells me that chimpanzees, like all apes, are vegetarian, sir.
And we can watch ...
Perfect for the mission. Nobody else can pull it off - not an army, not a man.
Give it.
It's so good to see you again.
Wait a minute. All right. Hold on.
I need a favor.
All right, so I made another deal.
No, that sucks.  How are we getting out?
That's right, big shot. Unless you do what we want you're not coming back.
So what's the deal, huh? Go into L.A., find the President's daughter, secure the box, and bring 'em both out - and I'm free?
Wait a minute, what are you talkin' about?
So you want me to take her out?  Is that an order from the President?
She's in the green.
I got an idea, Snake.  This looks like the prototype, right?
Yeah, kinda.
What are they?
What the hell is this?
I can see you're real concerned about your daughter.
Well, I'll think it over.
Yield. I have the advantage.
Don't recognize him. You were trapped by Morgana's sorcery.
Yes. He spoke to me. He said I would fight bravely tomorrow. I have never dreamed of Merlin before.
I want to thank you.
It's just that I have no experience, and no men to speak of. How can I--
In the great book.
What?!
Excalibur! Is it true?
Where hides evil, then, in my kingdom?
Merlin, tell me. Now that Guenevere is returned to me...
I cannot offer you the land, only my love...
Who is, then?
Because you and the land are one.
Me?
The law forbids it.
I have found you. The Queen. An apple. Tomorrow. Sir Gawain...
Is that Mandrake, Lord Merlin?
No, no, of course not. You are young...
A lovestruck page!
You provoke me, Merlin.
Merrin? I had notion he was over in Iraq. I think I read he was working on a dig around Nineveh.
Hello?
Here.
What's this?
I hate to ask you this but... for my daughter could you maybe give an autograph?
No. No rats.
How are you today?
Well, you mentioned her father... the divorce.
Oh no. I'd wait and see what happens with the Ritalin. I think that's the answer. Wait two or three weeks.
Have you ever known your daughter to swear and use obscenities?
Wait a minute. What are you talking about?
You're kidding! Like what?
Well, I'd say her vocabulary's rather extensive.
Convulsion?
Did he tell you about my party?
I mean, what if a person, let's say, was a criminal, like maybe a murderer or something, you know? If he came to you for help, would you have to turn him in?
Why, I don't understand?
No, is Regan aware of it?
Have you told him what's happening?
I told Regan that was holy water, I sprinkled some on her and she reacted very violently. It's tap water.
Cause I like it.
Yeah I like him. Don't you like him? Hey what's going on? What is this?
Where'd you ever get an idea like that?
Goodbye Father. I call you.
Hello Regan. I'm a friend of your mother, I'd like to help you.
But wouldn't that drive you out of Regan?
Who are you?
Oh really, when?
No.
Who places her trust in thee, my God.
Amen
Amen.
I've seen him.
I once did a paper on it
And Dennings, you read how he died?
Very much.
I get passes to the best shows in town. Mrs. K though, she gets tired and never likes to go.
Who's in it? Debbie Reynolds, Desdemona, and Othello, Groucho Marx. You're happy?
Come on!
The Dominicans. Go pick on them.
Almighty Lord, word of God the father Jesus Christ, God and Lord of all creation, who gave to your holy apostle the power to tramp underfoot serpents and scorpions. Grant me, your unworthy servant pardon for all my sins...
I cast you out!!! Unclean spirit...!
Yes?
I don't know.
Nothing's the matter. Is it, sweetheart?
Beasley.
What's our friend's problem?
Twenty years, Ma ...
I thought these were lost. Where did you find ...
Oh, look at you two.  So skinny. And those tiny suits ...
You want me to show up late a few nights?
Jack.
What's wrong with it?
Fuck him.
Only by relation.  Besides, they hate me, too.
They tried to electrocute me, Frank.
Cindy.
By the way, we gotta go see Ma tomorrow.
What's with Charlie?
So you'll come out, right?
Jack.
What?
Yeah, and what put him up there?
That's what we agreed.
I've tried to do well by you, Jack. By both of us.
It was a somewhat extraordinary day.
We were playing the lounge one night and she came in.
Why would I mind?
What?
How dare you say you love me.
He had to come quickly.  It was a big leak.
Expensive hangover.
February?
Right.  It's incredible how you do that.  Remember things.
Yeah, but he told you things.  He never told me anything.  Even though I was the oldest. It was always you two, running off, doing things together.
I could've.  But he didn't want me to.
You want to know how much I got tied up in deposits with Willie?  We're in for three weeks solid, Jack.
We're on after Meadowlark.  What's wrong?
We're playing for a goddamn gymnasium!
There's not going to be a viewing. I figured with the kids and all ...
She asked for it.
You should've told us you were coming, Ma. We would've come and got you.
You sure?
You got no right springing this on me, Frankie. It's unethical.
Look, Nick.  You want us to pack up, we'll pack up.
This is where the auditions were.
This is show business?
Look, miss.  We're tired, you have gum on your lip, and we're going home.
How should I take it?
I don't believe it.  I come all the way down down here, break a heel, and you're not gonna give me a chance because I have gum on my lip and I'm a few minutes late.
I'm sorry to interrupt, but when I saw you sitting here, I just had to come over.  Florence Simmons.
No. We are not supposed to be backing you up.
That!  You can't wear that!
If you ask me, this is pretty stupid.
My wife wears a seven.  You don't look like a seven to me.
I wear a seven.
The switch.  Hit the switch.
Jesus, you fellas've made a lot of noise.  What's with the stars?
Of course it smells like fish. We're on the ocean. What'd you expect, Chanel number five?
Great?
Some discussion.
I'm gonna throw up, Frank.  I mean it. Let's drop it for the ten o'clock, okay?
Yes, sir.  You're just what we needed on a night like this.
Lucky for you.  Well, there you go, guys. Don't spend it all in one place. Oh ... you want to count it, Jack?
How come?
Well, now, where's everyone run off to? Frank?
You miss him, don't you?
It's been a long time, Ma.
Can't sleep?
How's egghead?
Guess I got a little scattered.
Nothing.
My father proposed to my mother in there.
Long story.
Look, if you want to leave...
Yeah.  Got my own sign.
Yeah.
Vegetables.
Thanks.  For letting me in last night.
Process server. Ma said it's like a lawyer only the hours are more regular.  All I know's he came to take the TV one afternoon and ended up staying for dinner.  And breakfast.
Hey, what do you want to do?  Grow a beard?
Merry Christmas, Jack.
Try to kiss my butt just once before I'm transferred.
Jesus Christ, Castor.
I don't know.  Everything's jumbled -- so you're going to have to help me fill in a few blanks.
For being one helluva guy.
Well, you tried.  You failed miserably, but you tried.
No.
Five years ... I still can't get it out of my head -- an inch to the left, Matty would still be alive.
Never mind that!  Just take Jamie and get out of that house.  Don't tell anyone where you're going -- especially not him -- just GO.
You can't go.  You can't be anywhere near that place.
Jon, if I'm not there, he will be tipped off.  I'll get rid of Jamie -- but you and I are in this together.
Go on.
She doesn't know -- and she never will.
One of my informants spotted him -- right here in the city.
-- Castor?
Stay away from my family!
Give up, Castor.  People are going to find out.
They're too tight.
You better be nice, Castor. You could get mighty lonely now that Pollux is gone.
Kim?
What happened?
You merciless bastard!
-- I'll be one of the most powerful men in the country. Didn't matter how much cash I made pulling wet jobs -- I was still too low on the food chain -- always with somebody like Jon Archer after me.  The best part is -- I'm the GOOD guy.
Most of the current chiefs -- they must have pretty hefty prices on their heads.
What about me?
You'd have to start immediately.
Jon -- I don't have time to play games.  There're leftovers in the fridge.
-- Yes.
Where's Jamie?
That’s right. And auto supply...
Well, Alan, I think we’re gonna have a banner year. Sales are up almost twenty percent in the first quarter and we just landed a major trucking company account.
Excuse me?
But I think I like you better this way...
On a case by case basis...
Big Ed’s?  Big Ed’s Tires?  Why...?
What are you doing?
Look, you fit the profile exactly.  Thirties, house, kids, financial responsibilities.  You start thinking...this isn’t the life I dreamt about.  Where’s the romance, where’s the joie de vivre?  Suddenly, every lingerie ad in the Newark Star Ledger represents a life you can’t have...
I just saw Evelyn Thompson.
Hey, is that really necessary?
Hey, you can’t park that thing here.
Of course. Jack Campbell. I went to high school with you...you played baseball, right?  You’re doing well...
Like I said, it's a business deal...
What do you want to carry that gun around for, anyway? You're just gonna do something you'll regret...
But what do I do?
I’ve got kids, I’m going home...
What're you talkin' about?
Like the dress...?
Evelyn, right?
You mean don’t go at all? What about my internship?
Hey!  I was watching that!
It’s ten thirty, Jack. By eleven you’re gonna be sprawled out on the bed snoring your head off. We don’t have time for wining and dining.
No?
Excuse me?
It’s sad to hear your life is such a disappointment to you, Jack.
Surprise.  We’re pregnant...  Yeah...that must’ve been...I mean that was very unexpected.  But what are you gonna do, right?
Thank you...
I never used to be like this, Kate.  I had it all figured out.  No doubts, no regrets.
I think it’s good to be a little unsure about who you are.  It’s very human.
I guess...some of them are probably faking.
Pretty incredible, isn’t it?
So what’s the big surprise? You didn’t rent this place for the weekend, did you?
Don’t do that...
You look great.
Don’t get on that plane!
Mrs. Peterson.
And sleep you shall. Noblesse oblige is not dead.  Not yet anyway...Come, let’s get you some help.  Surely there must be a shelter somewhere in this city.
I just got a call from Terry Haight.  Bob Thomas is nervous...
You didn’t seem to mind offering to help me on Christmas day when you were unwrapping that Prada bag I gave you.
I found it!
You don't know what it's like out there.  Walking around like some kind of circus freak.  People staring, whispering --
Those yours too?
I can't take this.
External SRBs, orbital system engines. Its just like the shuttles you flew in --
What the hell you smiling at?  Just keep your mouth shut, and your mind on those SMBs --
What's wrong with me?
We can monitor the cloud's approach and observe the tests from here.
Oh, you dawg you.  Better not be my nurse!
Ben Grimm is a genuine American hero who's been through a terrible orde--
You need to control yourself and <u>think</u> before you --
I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
You're on fire!
Wait.  You mean there's chance we could be full-on-24-7-fantastic?
You two need a time-out.
Yeah, for the last time, I hope.  I'm done with this freak show.  I'm moving back to the real world.
Johnny, slow down.  <u>Think</u>.  You know mom didn't raise us to --
Then what is it?
But dreams don't pay the bills, do they?  Same old Reed, the hopeless optimist. Still reaching for the stars, with the world on your back.
Get a grip.  Reed.  We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch.  Just close the shields...
Well, uh, based on our history...you can handle the biogenetics, and I'll focus on the molecular physics.  Or, uhm, maybe I should take the biotech, you work the microscopes, since you have some background in electropho--
Uh, Sue...?  I <u>can't</u>.
It has to be the cloud.  It's fundamentally altered our DNA.
I'm saying, if you had a little more self control, you could locate the trigger.  Can you remember the exact emotions when --
He was going to take away all my data, equipment --
Every variable but <u>yourself</u>.  You don't eat, sleep.  You can't live in your head like --
I can...make it work.
Sue, I need some of that anger, rage, frustration --
It's been a good two years, Victor... The company's accomplished so much.
For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
Benes' natural defenses. White Corpuscles -- Antibodies. Once you begin to grow -- and become a menace to the body -- you'll trigger them off... MICHAELS With all the unknown factors in the body, I still say risking five lives for one is something we should reconsider --

-- and why we need you.
I can't even put a Band-Aid on my finger.
Duval. Dr. Peter Duval. Top brain man in the country. Ever hear of him?
Cora Peterson, his Technical Assistant. You'll join Duval and the others --
Yes, Cora.
I just wanted to thank you for taking me along.
Looks like you didn't batten it down too well.
Shouldn't you answer that?
If you had a transistor about this size and power output, and a thin enough wire --  -- could you piece it together?
Oh, no. Plenty of cause. He won't follow the herd, or change his convictions -- even when they're not popular. And he believes in an absolutely free interchange of information between scientists of different countries -- and these days, there's nothing more suspicious than that.
But that isn't possible.
It's against my better Judgment...
--and certain chemicals involving proteins --
A simple exchange, Mr. Grant. Corpuscles releasing carbon dioxide -- the moment they touch the Wall of the Lung -- in return for oxygen coming through from the other side.
How does it look, Doctor?
You have no right to blame Duval --
You still never know what's going on in anyone's mind...
Two in a row?
We're entering the Lymphatic System. Those are nuclei of cells, lining a Duct.
'Prepare for Miniaturization'...
Any reserve air?
Doctor -- the channel's getting awful narrow.
...What do you mean, you decided not to park here?
I decided not to - I'm, uh, not taking the trip as it turns out.
Drop that fucking money!
...Is this a fucking joke?
I'm fuckin' hungry now, you know.
Unguent.
Huh?
Okay.
Oh, Jean's okay. But there's three people up in Brainerd who aren't so okay, I'll tell ya that.
What the heck're you talkin' about? Let's just finish up this deal here -
This was s'posed to be a no-rough stuff-type deal -
DON'T EVER INTERRUPT ME, JERRY! JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP!
Now we had a deal here! A deal's a deal!
You're there in thirty minutes or I find you, Jerry, and I shoot you, and I shoot your fucking wife, and I shoot all your little fucking children, and I shoot 'em all in the back of their little fucking heads. Got it?
I thought you'd never ask. The older one is Janet, she's nine, and the younger one is Morgan.
Both of these.
Yah.
...So, I'm tendin' bar there at Ecklund & Swedlin's last Tuesday and this little guy's drinkin' and he says, 'So where can a guy find some action - I'm goin' crazy down there at the lake.'  And I says, 'What kinda action?' and he says, 'Woman action, what do I look like,' And I says 'Well, what do I look like, I don't arrange that kinda thing,' and he says, 'I'm goin' crazy out there at the lake' and I says, 'Well, this ain't that kinda place.'
Uh-huh - in what way?
Okay, well, thanks a bunch, Mr. Mohra. You're right, it's probably nothin', but thanks for callin' her in.
Where you girls from?
Yah. Maybe I'm sayin' that cause he smoked Marlboros.
Uhn.
Yah!
Wade's got a point there. I'll handle the call if you want, Jerry.
No! We can't let anyone know about this thing! We gotta play ball with these guys - you ask Stan Grossman, he'll tell ya the same thing!
Mr. Lundegaard?
Huh? Yah?
My father-in-law, he's the owner.
No. No, ma'am.
Yah, it's this vehicle I asked you about yesterday. I was just wondering -
Okay, are you sure, cause, I mean, how do you know?  Because, see, the crime I'm investigating, the perpetrators were driving a car with dealer plates. And they called someone who works here, so it'd be quite a coincidence if they weren't, ya know, connected.
but do you know that for sure without -
I know, but - well, how do you establish that, sir? Are the cars, uh, counted daily or what kind of -
Thank you, hon. How's Fargo?
Yah, real good. How you doin'?
Yeah, the three hundred and twenty thousand dollars, you got the money last month.
But the deal's already done, I already got the money -
Jerry Lundegaard.
Know who this is?
Well, what do ya mean?
My patience is at an end.
Where're you going?
Wade, have ya had a chance to think about, uh, that deal I was talkin' about, those forty acres there on Wayzata?
I know it's a lot.
Yah, well, it's a chunk, but -
I thought you were gonna show it to Stan Grossman. He passes on this stuff before it gets kicked up to me.
Oh, nothing, Wade. How ya doin' there?
We might be innarested.
What kind of finder's fee were you looking for?
Stan and I're okay.
Yah.
Oh, yah. Norm made some eggs.
Well, he's got his gun on his hip there, and he looks like a nice enough guy. It's a real shame.
You haven't monkeyed with his car there, have ya?
...Last vehicle he wrote in was a tan Ciera at 2:18 a.m.  Under the plate number he put DLR - I figure they stopped him or shot him before he could finish fillin' out the tag number.
Yah. Say, Lou, ya hear the one about the guy who couldn't afford personalized plates, so he went and changed his name to J2L 4685?
No motels registered any tan Ciera last night. But the night before, two men checked into the Blue Ox registering a Ciera and leavin' the tag space blank.
Gotta eat a breakfast, Marge.  I'll fix ya some eggs.
No, that's okay.
Yah, I'm down in the Twin Cities and I was just watching on TV about these shootings up in Brainerd, and I saw you on the news there.
...This is a nice place.
I think I remember Linda, yah.  She was - yah. So things didn't work out, huh?
Yah, if you're an engineer, yah, you could do a lot worse. Of course, it's not, uh, it's nothin' like your achievement.
Well, I always liked you, Mike.
Gustafson's accountant.
Copy.
My car! My car! Tan Ciera!
Thanks, hon. Time to shove off.
Thanks, hon.
They're real good.
Three-cent stamp.
Yah.
Hautman's blue-winged teal got the twenty-nine cent. People don't much use the three-cent.
And his wife?
Geez. Looks like this thing goes higher than we thought. You call his home?
Oh, my.
Bob was a champion bodybuilder.  You know that chest expansion program you see on TV?  That was his idea.
Cornelius!  How are you?
I'm going to need you out-of-town a little more this week.  We've got some "red-flags" to cover.
Is that your blood?
You don't get paid to abuse the copy machine.
What does that mean?
Whoever set this homemade dynamite could've blown out the pilot light days before the explosion.  The gas, it seems, was just a detonator.
I'm on to you.  You're a faker.  You aren't dying.
You haven't been going to yours.
I got this dress at a thrift store for one dollar.
This is a sweet side of you.  Picking these up for ...  "Mrs. Haniver" and... "Mrs. Raines." Where are they?
Here.
I think everything's okay here.
Really... I mean it.  Have you been going to your groups?
You hear that?
Hear what?
What is this?  Who did this?
What kind of stupid question is that?!
Marla... I need to talk to you.  It's going to take a tremendous act of faith on your part for you to hear me out.
I don't want to hear anything you've got to say.
Sixty seconds, then I'm out of here.
Absolutely, you have every right.  I need you to do me a favor.
Why are you doing this?
Who's this?
You were in here last Thursday night.
-- But, in here, in everyone, there's the squint of a five-day headache. Yet they forced themselves to be positive.  They never said "parasite;" they said "agent."  They always talked about getting better.
I mean -- for a living.
I don't know, maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe it's a terrible tragedy.
Delivered from armchairs in obscure green stripe patterns.
This time maybe get a widescreen TV. You'll be occupied for weeks.
What?
They're called "cigarette burns."
Why would anyone want this shitty job?
I don't know, either.  I want to find out.  I've never been hit, have you?
Call what off?
What fight?
My boss, probably.  Who would you fight?
I know that.
What car?
Hum.
Soldier of Fortune.  Business Week. New Republic.
Doesn't matter.
Yeah, I'm sure.
Look at your hand.
Listen to me.  You have to consider the possibility that God doesn't like you, he never wanted you.  In all probability, He hates you.  This is not the worst thing that can happen...
Yeah.  Where you headed?
There's fight club in Delaware City.
What are we doing?
What should I have told you?
Should I E-mail you?  Should I put this on your "action item list?"
I want to know --
You're asking questions that don't have answers.  You know just as much about Project Mayhem as anybody else.
... is over.
Oh, yeah.  I didn't really know my Dad...
There!  Happy?  I asked for one thing from you... one simple promise.  Now look what you've done!
This isn't possible...
We're going to have to do something about Marla...
...go through with this? What are you going to do?
I think this is about where we came in.
Look, I can be selfish, I know that.  I'm not blind to my own failings...
If I leave, you will be right back where I found you...
You told me you'd say that, too.
It's free to all.
Alright, Christ!  Fucking let me go!
Why?
Yeah ... animals and s-s-s ---
That's good.  Get all your tears out now, you'll need your eyes.  For the signs.
What happened when Eugene tried to kill himself out of turn?
This makes no sense.  Isabella was supposed to crash her van into a lake.  Could we have altered her destiny when we had her arrested?
Make sure all these people will be at the meeting tonight.
Um, Clear?  I'm sorry...about before. I...
I'm not sure I understand.
So if you never got off the plane, none of us would be alive in the first place.
I had tickets to go, but one day I'm in Paris, trippin' on acid, sippin' lattes an' such, and this dude gets whacked by a falling sign.
Freaked me out so bad I hid in a shopping cart for four hours. 'Course, missed the show...
Good.  Cause we just got some new info and I don't need you getting freaky on me.
Please.  It's not going to wait.
What?
First I'm stuck with Jury Duty, now this nonsense.
Yeah, so what happened?
Tell me again how it started.
You mean Alex Browning.
I tried calling last night but your father --
I'm not following you --
Guys, let's not panic.  Isabella's safe.
How do you know?
Kalarjian?
Shouldn't we pull over?
For God's sake, leave him alone, Dad.
Thanks, Dad.  I'll call you.
Your mother would have been so proud of the way you've handled yourself through all of this...
I know it's crazy, but I'm really scared for the others.  I've got this terrible feeling.
How would I know? You think I'm some sort of...
Thirty-nine.
I'm not just layin' down a bunch of math here, with this. I'm talking about indications... omens... that day, that we were meant to die. That, if, we have been aware of... would have saved everyone on the plane.
Carter, get out!
I don't.
You're the fuckin' devil.
So, why'd you want us to meet you here? Now?
You mean the snake?
Wow!
You read me, Brewer?
Modified M-16 A2 and over-under M-79 grenade launcher, with Sionics sound suppressor, Tracor starlight scope and LAC/R-100 Laser sighting system.
Batteries not included.
Cocktail party.  Uh huh, right.  Let's saddle up.
That's it?  Some C-4, a map and a knife?
I've seen worse places.
She likes you.  Says you're dinky- dau.
It's a guy in a cage.
American?
Why's that?
Huntington Beach, California.
Rambo.  NVA coming.  Pig dog Kinh say meet them here.  Whole garrison from Con Cuong is out.
Christ.  How'd you get here?
You try get across Laos?  Get to Thailand?
John.  My name is John.
Alternate LZ Zulu Sierra at 0500. It says "May have heat.  Don't be late.  All our love."
Sir, there's something else... a TRANSAT relay.  Just came through.
Man, you are one scary-looking motherfucker!
We left some people behind there, John... POWs.
My parents were divorced.
...My mother calls every week. Like a recurring nightmare. "So, have you met anyone?"..."No mom".. "So what's going to happen?"... "I don't know Mom"... I only thank God I moved out.
Getting your nails done is one thing but going to dinner with a bunch of strangers and <u>him</u>... She didn't even look at him.
I'm shocked.  With a child bearing body like yours...  ... why a man would have to be out of his mind!
Are you in a mood today baby? Is this one of those days when you're in ...whadda call it... an emotional abyss?  Talk to me, cause I don't understand these moods.
<u>What</u>!
... So... where did you sleep last night?
I tell you something, Anne.  I really feel like I'm cursed.
He's not a moron.
See, I told you!
Bullshit!  If you're going to hurt me, you hurt me now -- not some long... drawn out hurt that takes weeks of my life because you don't have the balls!
How have you been?
Well, it's not unusual in his case... Sometimes victims of tragedies are subject to the brain's replay system. The brain never loses anything - it just stores it up and waits. A person could actually re-experience the full effect of a tragedy, long after the event took place. Are you relatives?  Well, it doesn't matter. We'll take care of it. He'll have to be sent back to the same institution.. 
Uh... basement I think...
Um...I've got to run. I've bee doing this all day.  Are you going to be all right?
About dinner as a concept or about dinner with...  <u>Raoul</u>?
You're so witty.  I'm so jealous... I <u>need</u> to get out of here, Jack, and do something other than sit in this apartment and count how many funny lines you have per page.
How much?
Okay... twenty dollars... When can you...
God, I have no idea.  She's worked here for fifteen years and I have no idea.  I'll call her.
No, no... I mean that sort of happens along the way but no...  I'm on a very special quest.
I know!  You can't imagine how surprised I was.  Who would think you could find anything divine on the Upper East Side.
Oh, please... you're embarrassing me.
...You are such a great guy. First the money, now this.  Isn't he fabulous!?
You're a true <u>friend</u>.
I'm not. Believe me. <u>I'm</u> scum.
So what? You going to help me?
SAW WHO!!?
Who?
It's such a great song.
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND!!
Happily married, probably.
Will you stand still so I can do this!
Are you all right?
You can't leave me tied up out here alone, you fucking faggot!
Parry Parry?
...I..uh..I get to read some of the books but mostly I..just calculate production costs from first edition hard cover publication to paperback. After paperback it's basically someone else's problem.
There isn't any more to tell.
No, really..believe me - there isn't any more. This is it.
Well, it's enough for me.
I never say anything I have to.
What are we about to do?
Listen, I'm not feeling well.
Divorced.
Twinky?
Yeah, 'cause she's so "twinky"...
Yeah, I told her it was you, but that you're wearing a wig, 'cause on TV you're mostly bald in the front.
If you're sayin' you're somethin' better'n what I am, that's one thing. But I can't say much a someone who'd run off an' leave a woman in a situation like this an' feel easy about it. An' that's all I gotta say.
Come on, DiPesto. We can still have a good time.
I'm sorry.
I love it.
"Every trail that you blaze/Makes me..."
No.
Who said I was depressed?
Just finish eating.
Where are you going?
I didn't get it, did I?
We been wantin' to ask you something. Are you the guy on YV?
She says you're the one that sells all the cars on TV.
I'm gonna give you our number, Donnie, just in case...  We're both professionals, if you didn't guess.
I just can't look at you.
It's not funny. He permanently sprained his neck, and since then it's been extremely difficult for him to tuck the violin.
Yes, it is. I can't take seeing him, sitting there like a stone.
Why? Am I some kind of freak to you or something?
Actually, it's very admirable, the way she works. She'll probably be enormously successful, because she's attractive as well, not that that's so important in music, but...
Well, if you just maybe did something with your hair, or...
I guess you fell in the water.
That's right. Have you anything to suggest?
After that, I plan to read some music and rest for awhile.
Wait...
Serious, that's what's important to you?
That's right.
Will you let me talk to you, please?
Catherine...
No. It's useless, Robert. It wouldn't work, not ever...
She's tremendously gifted, this girl.
You've been staying in a motel all this time?
No, you're not. Go ahead and take your time.
It's a Borzoi.
I don't think that's true.
Come on, Terry, we got a ride!
There'd never be a hole big enough. Now took at me, for instance, when I was just one person, before Bobby, I had so much garbage collectin' onto me every day, I was thinkin' about gettin a dispose all...
That's an old maid's tale.
John believes in the basic goodness of man, and that's fine, but gaze into the pit like I have and that view seems a little soporific. And not unlike television, it hardly represents the real world...
Why you have an attitude for?
What are you doin' here?
Just chill.
So what you think of me?
Wussup, Victor.
I won't let my motha cut my hair.
Forget it! C'mon Let's go to the pool.
Where you goin'?
I gotta go take a piss.
Yeah, he got a bad attitude.
Who?
So what do you want with her anyway?
Look. You know that and I know that, but somebody's bucking for a promotion. I think it's that bozo, Hanrahan, I can't be sure. Anyway, unless I go back there with something, you and your son-in-law are next week's scapegoats.
By the way: what kind of name is Poon?
You're kidding.
You mean her.
I have no idea.
You should have seen what she wanted to do with the place. Mauve.  So what's your name?
Fletch F. Fletch
I see. And what do you do for a living, Mr. Fletch?
For a gentleman who was just found holding a bag full of heroin...
After I shoot you, I stick the knife in my arm, then place it in your dead hand. Self-defense. We don't do this very much anymore... but we have. Got rid of a lot of minorities that way.
My God, you're serious.
So where do you know Alan from?
We play tennis at the club.
Well, I haven't played in a while because of these kidney pains.
Your aunt?
Mrs. Smith.
I can't discuss another patient. You know that.  Well, I can't find anything wrong with you.
For sure?
The two surfer boys?
Oh, I'll help, Fletch. I'm a slave to that sonofabitch. He busted me, third offense, gave me a choice: Work for him or do fifteen long. All I get out of this is free snort.
Gonna need it. That boy is dangerous. Fletch?
I'm fine.
Doctor Holmes went to get you some smelling salts. He was quite surprised that you fainted.
That's it?
That's it.
I don't know what you're referring to. Wendy maintains her own residence.
Damn... lost again. Sorry.
Bravo, Mr. Fletcher.
My parents were great fans of the former President.
Yes. Where you from, Harry?
Ten days ago?
He sighs.
Lets see, it was before he moved to L.A... four years April.
I couldn't sit home and play the mournful widow anymore, and the police didn't need me, so I tried watching a Lakers game on TV, but the announcer talked to fast and I couldn't understand a lot of what was happening, so I figured if I came down here maybe you could explain the rules to me, and besides, I missed you.
Fat Sam is turning state's evidence.
It is nothing of a sexual nature I assure you.  One thousand, just to listen. I don't see how you could turn that down Mr...
Nugent. Ted Nugent.
Why don't you try suicide?
Precisely. Are you a good shot?
Do you have a passport?
Rio. Flight 306. Departs at eleven PM.
You sure got the hard part.
Will you kill me?
Not our kind of people, you understand.
Cute young thing, too.
She's cute as a button.
Oh, that's all right, I've got lots more. Want to see the reception?
Who is it?
I'm sorry, I'm just surprised to see you. I didn't think... What do you want?
All this goes on Underhill's bill?
You were in the war?
'I've acted out my life on stages, with ten thousand people watching...'
No. You can't. Look, I know you don't know me from Adam, but you've got to trust me.
What's wrong, Gail?
No.
And they're leaving the country tomorrow night.
Bastard.
I'm calling the police. Right now.
Would you be caring for something to eat or drink, sir?
Lock's busted.
Tell the cops.
You broke it? You know the source?
I have pictures of him. Dealing...
Utah?
Yeah. It's wedged in between Wyoming and Nevada. I'm sure you've seen pictures.
What about finding the source?
Who? Donnie and Marie?
It's called journalism, Fletch. It's called getting both sides of the story. Something you apparently don't know anything about.
You know, I've had it up to here with your bullshit. I need a story from you by tomorrow.
I'm out, Frank. You lost faith in me.
Yes?
I'd appreciate an opportunity to discuss this with you.
But I ain't got you...
Oh, that!  Don't take it personally. He always wakes up before I do. Down boy!  Roseanne Barr naked!
Poor taste.  I know.  Listen, I respect homosexuals.  When I was young, my maid was a homosexual.  My maid was a homosexual.
Who?
Listen, Queen Collie, I have a code. I never, ever, drop a case.  Besides, I, uh, used all your money to pay my bills, so I kinda owe you.
I ask you to find a girl and instead you steal a C.D. from me. Ford.  You suck.
Damn, Ford, you're the most cynical man in the industry and that's not easy.
I haven't seen her around, and as for who would want to kill Johnny Crunch, line forms to the left. You'd find less people on our planet who wanted him alive.
I've heard cars fuck with more harmony.
So what about this watch?
Tonight after I see Don. Some Beverly Hillbilly just hired me to find you-know-fucking-who. Name's Colleen Sutton.
Why did you interrupt?  Maxwell seemed like he wanted to hire me.
Yeah, let's bury her.
Your timing swallows the massive one. Grendel just tried to kill us, he's about to frame and kiss Don, and we can't do shit.  Don't even ask about those discs. Goddamn that Art Mooney with a star by his name!  It's tied to Johnny's C.D., I know.
Without Grendel knowing about it. B-I-N-G-O and Bingo was his name-O. Counterfeit C.D.s.  Tape piracy has graduated to disc piracy, the sound quality's better, and so's the money.
Hello?
You okay?
Uh... wha?  You're supposed to answer those questions, not ask 'em.  I take it a woman named Colleen Sutton is not your big sister and that the late D.J. Johnny Crunch ain't your daddy?
You know rock-n-roll?  Darlin', I've been in the music industry for as long as you've lived.  I've seen things you can't even have nightmares about... but then I guess I'm just not equipped to know the industry the way you do...
Zuzu Petals, you're not bad.  In fact, I was discussing this whole rock-n-roll thing with my pal Art Mooney the other day.  You know him?
Zuzu, wake up...
Hah fluck, great video, huh?
Nice left you got there, jerk.
As Clark Gable said to Ava Gardner in Mogambo:  'Fuck the purse, we're gonna die-e-e.'
Fairlane, you gonna find out who killed the lead singer of Black Vomit?
Who's my real father, man?
Nice tie, Lt. Anus, sir.
If you're hiding something... oh, oh, I'll have so much fun.
Have a problem, call Ford Fairlane.  He won't solve your case, but who cares, you'll be dead in a couple days anyway. Let's face it.  After today, the California Raisins aren't gonna hire you.
What's fine?
Well, hello, Ford.
Mmmmmmm.  Mmmm, mmm.
Shock.
It's 7:30.  You really should get a watch.
What about Don?
When I say 'no,' run for the door.
You'd said something about proof...
When I was young, I read <u>Billboard</u> and I could not believe how much Grendel Records and how little of it my idiot father Old Jack Grendel got.
How nice.
I'm clean.
Where'm I goinna get a pizza this time o' night?
No... yeah...
Did you pick up the car?
Henri... I need one more favor from you.  I know I am imposing...
Are you having trouble raising the half million?
Je peux l'ouvrir tout de suite?
Comment va-t-elle?
What happens to the schedule?
What's your story?
What?
Where's he from?
That's in France.
What about you, Doyle?  Who's the best fighter you ever seen?
What ya doin' out so late?  Hidin' from the cops?
Yeah.  In the late innings.  Ya look like a night's sleep wouldn't kill ya.
When ya go back on?
A bunch of lousy little spic car thieves.
Nothing in there except a New York street map.
Policy man in Queens.
Whatta you say we wait and give him a tail?
No sir -- this is where Joel lives.
We got information that there's no shit in the street -- it's like a desert full of junkies with a big score coming in to make everybody well.
Timezit?
Can you use a new suit for Christmans?
Forty dollars -- was $250.
I'm afraid the rest of Ward's Island isn't nearly as romantic - a pollution plant, a hospital, a training school for garbage men and that area over there, where the old cars are kept, prior to being processed for shipment to, among other places, The Charnier Shipping Company, of Marseilles, France.
For garbage?
It looks open on the other side.
Hey, bud.
Butch called.
Did he?
Frank...what's wrong?
You give him his drops?
Okay...
Frank, we need to talk...
What do you mean?
415 Greenwich St.  #302.  Under the body of a murdered woman.
I wanna be wrong here.  But we need to go to the precinct and talk about it.
Frank, this is not the time to be worried about covering up if you had a thing with this girl.
I know.  Sorry, Dad.
Don't be scared.  This time I'm right behind you if you fall.
You ready?
I got fed up with all the bullshit.
I'm right with you, man.  He's got the heart of a lion.  Hey, how 'bout the first game of the Series?
The World Series.  You called Buford's homer.
You call your son Little Chief?
That's impossible.
I don't know.
Sun spot?
Too busy playin' ball, huh?
It was an abandoned warehouse - hit by lightening.  Butch told Ma it was just one wrong turn. Said it wasn't your fault.  You went with the training, with your instincts.  If you'd just gone left instead of right, you would've made it.
But that's tomorrow.
Dad...?
Chief?!  Is that you?
Dad...Dad... There's... I need to...
Murdered?  Why?
I don't know...  What about the other women?
What do I tell them?
Yes it is...we did this.  We changed everything.  I've been having bad dreams, Johnny. Dreams where I die...in the fire.  I was supposed to die in that warehouse.
I know...  But Dad, you can't go back.  You didn't die in that fire.  And no matter what you do, nothing is gonna change that.  So all we can do is deal with this...and try to make it right.
He took your wallet?
Please, Dad, just do it.
You're telling me this maniac is a cop? What the hell am I supposed to do with that one?
What's wrong?
No.  I gotta tell him the address, so he doesn't go in.
Another rough night, huh?  That it?
Sounds good.
She's pretty special.
I try to be.
Going?  How do you mean?
Who brought up this bright idea?
According to the Guinness Book, you passed the World's Record several whacks ago.
You're all just jealous.
What're you gonna do?
We'd be all alone.  We could do anything we wanted and nobody would see.
I'm going downstairs to get a beer. You want one?
Do you want a beer or not?
I'm gonna be sicker than all of you, man.  Now I gotta spend the whole weekend totally straight...  I don't think I can make it, man!
That's the way it is, man. Cellars are dark.
Nothin'.  I was just foolin' around.
I'm sorry.  I just wanted to surprise you.  What can I say?
This door was open just a minute ago, wasn't it?
Why don't you help us?
See anything?
This has been on helluva beginning to a quiet weekend in the country.
Being a jerk is better than being nothing.
Darren, we better turn around.
Once we nail Roy, that's it. Victory is ours.
Yeah, hi.  Listen, I've got to talk to your dad.  About Jason. I've got a plan.  I need to buy some things first but mainly need help to...
Why?
Nancy.
Are you ready?  He's taken our young men off to teach them my favorites sport.
Now you better cool out a minute, boy.  You already almost got your head blown to pieces.
So let's talk.
I know who you are.
I need to talk to you.
Jason Voorhees is dead.
Look --
I gotta get back to work.
Good night, beautiful.
Lock this asshole up.
Jessica, I'm so sorry.  I...I wanted to have this cleaned up before you got here.
Yeah, well somebody fucked her and if I find out it was you, I'm gonna come over there and shoot you in the head.
Wanna know how I did that?
What am I gonna do -- I'm locked up in a friggin' cell?!
Look, I know I treated her bad --
Steven!
She's a waitress at Joey B's but she needs some extra cash.  Ward's the pimp.
I hear the crew members are cute guys in their twenties.
A major prick.
Sounds good. I hear there's a shuffleboard court on deck -- it might be kinds cool...
What? Don't be a lightweight...this is top dollar toot.
Right.
And you'll never do it again.
She never should've set foot on this ship. This is your fault!
What are you doing in here?
I'11 be coming around your stateroom in exactly fifteen minutes, Miss Mason. You'd better have your biology project ready or I'm phoning your parents.
Really?
I seem to detect a hint of ingenuousness in your tone.  In other words, level with me.
No. It was just a normal summer. I've never been able to figure it out.
Rennie...
I got you a present.
But I didn't get you one...
We'll be okay. I want you to wait by the lifeboats, just in case.
But Rennie...
Rennie...what'd they do to you??
Very big.
I wrapped my sandwiches in tinfoil. I ate and drove. I had one of those big checkered cabs.
Nicky. I was thinking about you. I went to the preview last night.
It's over, finished and done with.
I'm trying to think. When did you start looking so terrible? You look awful.
What do I exude?
Tonight you find out what it means to suffer.
Do you want me to tell you what it was like, reading that review at the newstand with trucks rumbling past and street vendors facing Mecca?
Do we care?
Do not inhale.
The man has taken over my mind. He's not only out there. He's in my head and I can't get rid of him. I can't write a word without imagining his response. I'm paralyzed as an artist.
Don't wait Efor me.
I used to carry a gun when I drove a cab.
Shoot him, Nicky. Not that we really mean it. But where does he live?
What are we talking about?
This could Pbe it.
Alan's very sick. He has to go to New Mexico and sit in a lukewarm solution.
You know about Adele.
Apparently it didn't help. You know about Peter, of course.
I never see you anymore. Where are you all day?
I don't drink coffee, Daddy. And this is not what we should be talking about.
Oh please. Not now.  She wants you to stop seeing What's- Her-Name. Finally. Now and forever. Do you think that's too much to ask? For a wife of nineteen years.
Don't call her Mother all the time. It makes her sound tragic and unforgiving. What happened to Mom?
And you blame me. It's because we never talk. Let's talk.
What will we talk about?
First you tell me.
See, Daddy.
Who the hell cares?
And you've been extremely patient.
I am really, deeply sorry.
What happens if somebody comes in here right now and shoots you?
What did it say?
Life is true.
Lillian says it once a week. `Why doesn't he come live with us?'
They're only gonna lose.
It's all connected, Pop. It's one life. Baseball is memory. How do fathers and sons show their love? They go to a ball game together. Thirty-five years later, they sit in the kitchen and remember.
I think the building's okay. At least for the time being.
I'm looking at you trying to think. Put your face in the mirror. I know I recognize you from somewhere.
Oh yeah?
You're a family man, Frankie?
Wife and daughter. My father's still alive. He outlives me, starting tonight. Because the Mets just tied the score. It was only a matter of time, wasn't it?
Well I am. Worried sick. Everybody quotes Steven Schwimmer. He's here to announce the death of civilization. He kills a play every time he farts.
Hurry back. Hurry back to what?
Yessiree, Bob.
Burnt sienna.
And the Father replies?
You've worked with Elliot?
So does Elliot.
You keep slipping away. How do you do that?
He wears a disguise.
Yes. I've seen your victims. One past and one future. I thought I might convince you to reconsider.
In this place there are no untouchables -- and no work is beneath any of us!
Just an admirer...
You will respect the law.
After what they did at the massacre -- it's only an eye for an eye.
Bapu, for me, and the rest,  if that is what you want, we will accept it. But out there  already there is rioting because Hindus fear you are going to give too much away.
Come with me now, Vincent.  You've gone as far as you can go.
We were wondering if we should leave some things to chance.
I look around, I see a lot of dry eyes. The Director was not...  ...universally loved.  He was leading the cut-backs in the program.  You're looking at a room full of motives.
With respect, Sir--it may be the only unaccountable specimen but the profile suggests--
According to this, he's a sick man.  Congenital heart condition.  Who knows how long the specimen has been here but there's an 80 percent chance the owner of that eyelash has already died himself from natural causes.
I'll run a crossover on the eyelash for any family or associate connections--
It is hard to believe he could be one of their elite workers.  You've seen their security system.  They know who works there.  Even if you ignore the man's expiration date, his profile suggests that he doesn't have the mathematical propensity let alone the stamina to pass their physicals.
Get it.  From outside, if you have to.
Surely you know what you have.
Would you care to look--in the telescope?
I've been looking for him.  Do you know where he is?
Don't be deceived, Irene.  These are just the clothes.  He has to wear them. Something I could never do.
Okay, how tall did you <i>used</i> to be?
Listen, I don't want you to think I'm ungrateful --I know you and that little broker--what do you call him?
It needs work.
That's not the point.
Hey, how much of you can be there?  Even if the "J. Edgars" do find something, in a week--  you'll be slightly out of their jurisdiction.  Come on, we've got to get drunk immediately.
Up there they wouldn't be a problem.
--What car?--Go to sleep.
Any particular reason?
What are you talking about?
You <i>are</i> a catch.  No doubt she's worried that she would lower the standard of your offspring. Everybody wants to "breed up".  What's wrong with her?
You know how it is with these altered births --somebody told her she's not going to live forever and she's been preparing to die ever since.
Will you be okay?
Thank you.
German, is that you?
Why are you inventing problems?  You two are a couple of goddam clones.  You look so right together, I want to double my fee.
Hugo!  I've found him!
Looks bad, doesn't it, Irene?  What about <i>you?</i>  Where were you last night?
Were <i>you</i> alone?
Yes.
So we don't know for sure about you, either.
Why are we leaving?
What about the car?
Who are they?
I can't.
I'm not doing it.
--I've read your profile.  I don't know about the father but you carry enough hereditary factors on your own.  You can have other children.
The obvious.  But we are both not interested in that right now.
Where do you want to go?
What's Beynon got set up?
I guess I'm kind of...
Listen, I'm just as nervous as you are.
Thanks again.  I 'm glad you waited.
... Bank President, three tellers and one guard...
Keep going over these. I don't want anybody getting lost.
It will be such a relief not to have to think about it any more.
Doc...
They checked in.
Yeah.
I can handle it.
You've got all the answers. What about when they find the body on the train?
You're full of ifs.
Maybe. At least I got to him.  Where do we go from here?
Yeah.
I don't know.
Get in the shower. You'll feel okay.
Laughlin. He's always got his family around... that wife and kid of his have to stand by his side to make sure he stays off the juice and horses.
You're crazy.
I really hope you have a nice trip.
Oh my God.
One thing though... how do I explain this to my wife?
You were with him?
Yeah. I got out.
Okay. How many bank exits?
Chambers - Reilly. Time lock opens 20 minutes before they start doing business...
I 'm handling the fine stuff. You're back up all the way...
Where we go in1?
I guess you ain't gonna shoot me, are you?
Don't you want to go to the airport?
Come on. How much?
And I keep my mouth shut?
Well, I paid a hell of a price. Now for God's sake keep your mouth shut.
Wish you hadn't said that. When Slim Canfield's lips are sealed, they're sealed.
The glucose will begin working in half an hour. You'll feel better then...
I've got to stop.
When did you find out?
Last Sunday afternoon, Eric and two of his boys arrive with Frank and tell me that he's rumbled. Somehow, he's seen the film and was about to shoot his mouth off. They ask me for some whisky and start forcing it down his throat.  I thought they'd just duff him up a bit. Honest.
What did you do?  Albert?
What about the brakes?
Fine. Nowt wrong with them.
You know what the bloody time is!  It's two o'clock in the bloody morning!
Why?
Jack?
Train goes at four minutes past twelve. You've just got time.
How were things between you and Frank?
Nicer than most.
I know him too.
Oh, do you?
Really?
Really?
To the demon king's castle, of course.
You were seen parking your car. The demon king waves his wand and I was dispatched to bring you to him. Lucky for you I waited.
Oh, he was. He told me a magic spell that would make you come.
Entertaining.
Now tell me the truth.
Don't worry. She's bound to be upset.
That must be interesting.
Did you work with him, Keith?
I'm at the Las Vegas. Behind the dance hall.  Do you know a man called Albert Swift?
Thorpey. They were waiting for us in the car park.
Ah, Edna, come in. Join the tea set.
What happened to you, then?
No.  You bastard. You knew they'd come back.
Stuff it! My girl friend's coming from Liverpool tonight.  Nice surprise, isn't it?
I see.
Are you a traveller?
Don't be bloody silly. You're the first since Monday.
I'm sorry.
And what you going to do?
I'll call the police.
Are you awake?
What you going to do?
Is he?
What are you doing? Advertising Martini?
I've always ad your welfare at heart, Eric. Besides which, I'm nosy.
Cyril didn't like it, either.
Yeah.
We know why you're all steamed up, and so do Gerald and Sid.
Ask me?
That, Harry? That's another hundred - twenty-five pounds notes of the realm.
All right. Two hundred.
How about that, Jack?  Old Harry thought I was having him on.
...Polacks...
All of 'em.  They, hey: it happens to us all.
You missed a fucking sale.  Big deal.  A deadbeat Polack.  Big deal. How you going to sell 'em in the first place...?  Your mistake, you shoun'a took the lead.
What?
It is.
That's right?
With River Oaks?
That's what I'm saying.  Why?  The leads.  He's got the good leads... what are we, we're sitting in the shit here.  Why?  We have to go to them to get them.  Huh.  Ninety percent our sale, we're paying to the office for the leads.
Just the act.
That's the truth...
Huh.
No.
...you're absolutely right.
How do you know he'd buy them?
No.
Well.  Well...
You didn't?
A buck a shot.
Is that what I said?
What?
What?  What?  The leads.
It's not something for nothing, George, I took you in on this, you have to go.  That's your thing. I've made the deal with Graff.  I can't go.  I can't go in, I've spoken on this too much.  I've got a big mouth.  "The fucking leads" et cetera, blah blah blah "...the fucking tight ass company..."
Are you sure?
Well, to the law, you're an accessory.  Before the fact.
Then, you know, they wouldn't be so ups...
Yes.
Huh?
He said he filed...
I was at home, where were you?
You have nothing to hide.
Who used to say that?
Go to lunch, will you...
I want to work today, that's why I came...
Mmm.
Moss...Who told him?
Please don't leave.  I'm going to talk to you.  What's your name?
Levene!
I'm talking with Mr. Lingk.  If you please, I'll be back in.  I'll be back in a while...I told you, check with Mr. Williamson.
You stupid fucking cunt.  You, Williamson...I'm talking to you, shithead...You just cost me six thousand dollars.  Six thousand dollars.  And one Cadillac.  That's right.  What are you going to do about it?  What are you goin to do about it, asshole. You fucking shit.  Where did you learn your trade.  You stupid fucking cunt.  You idiot.  Whoever told you you could work with men?
Hey, fella, let's get this done...
Would you come in here, please?
...then...
Murray...
Yes.  I am.  I'm sorry to antagonize you.
Murray said...
I'm out.
I've seen those leads.  I saw them when I was at Homestead, we pitched those cocksuckers Rio Rancho nineteen sixty-nine they wouldn't buy.  They couldn't buy a fucking toaster.  They're broke, John. They're cold.  They're deadbeats, you can't judge on that.  Even so. Even so.  Alright.  Fine.  Fine. Even so.  I go in, FOUR FUCKING LEADS they got their money in a sock.  They're fucking Polacks, John.  Four leads.  I close two. Two.  Fifty per...
Why?
I can't close these leads, John. No one can.  It's a joke.  John, look, just give me a hot lead. Just give me two of the premium leads.  As a "test," alright?  As a "test" and I promise you...
I will close.  John, John, ten percent.  I can get hot.  You know that...
What are we going to say?
No.  You're right.  That's for later.  We'll talk in a month. What have you got?  I want two sits. Tonight.
Is that what you're saying?
What happened?
Get 'em to me!
It's not impossible.
Yes, I am.
Excuse me...
I don't know what you are saying.
Do I have to tell you?  Moss.
What?
Abso...
Their check's no good?  They're nuts...?
You did that?
"...you have to believe in yourself..."
"...You look around, you say, 'This one has so-and-so, and I have nothing..."
Rick.  Let me tell you.  Wait, we're in the...
Dave...
Shelly...!
How was it...?
The only arrangement I'll accept is full investment.  Period.  The whole eight units.  I know that you're saying 'be safe,' I know what you're saying.  I know if I left you to yourselves, you'd say 'come back tomorrow,' and when I walked out that door, you'd make a cup of coffee...you'd sit down...and you'd think 'let's be safe...' and not to disappoint me you'd go one unit or maybe two, because you'd become scared because you'd met possibility.  But this won't do, and that's not the subject..." Listen to this, I actually said this. "That's not the subject of our evening together." Now I handed them the pen.  I held it in my hand. I turned the contract, eight units eighty-two grand. "Now I want you to sign."  I sat there.  Five minutes.  Then, I sat there, Ricky, twenty-two minutes by the kitchen clock.  Twenty-two minutes by the kitchen clock.  Not a word, not a motion. What am I thinking? "My arm's getting tired?" No.  I did it.  I did it.  Like in the old says, Ricky.  Like I was taught... Like, like, like I used to do...I did it.
Like you taught me...
Yes.
Sure.
The monthly interview...?
Or a piss...?  A great meal fades in reflection.  Everything else gains.  You know why? 'Cause it's only food.  This shit we eat, it keeps us going.  But it's only food. The great fucks that you may have had.  What do you remember about them?
She called the consumer...the attorney, I don't know.  The attorney gen...they said we have three days...
I don't understand.
Today.  Today.  Which, in any case, it was not, as there were a couple of points on the agreement I wanted to go over with you in any case.
I'm very sorry, Jimmy.  I apologize to you.
She wants her money back.
We'll speak to her, Jim...
I...
She told me I had to get back the check or call the State's att...
Cop couldn't find his dick two hands and a map.  Anyone talks to this guy's an asshole...
Fuck you.
Is that what I did?  Dave?  I humiliated you?  My God...I'm sorry...
Sittin' on top of the world, sittin' on top of the world, everything's fucking peachfuzz...
With what?  With what, John, they took the leads...
We had a slight burglary last night.
No, where is it?
I'm leaving very early tomorrow, before you wake up.
I got surprises for everybody!
Goddamn bitch.
Deanna, will you get back into the house!
I don't want to stay here...
Otherwise the police will come to see you and your wife and children will be dishonored and destitute. Of course, if my information as to your gains is incorrect, I'll dip my beak just a little.  Just a little, but no less than one hundred dollars, and don't try to deceive me, eh paisan?
Hey Mike, what can I say?
Great, Havana's great.  Lots of activity in Havana!  Anybody I know here.  Five-Angels?  Anybody?
Jeeze, it's great you came along, Mike... You know, we've never spent a night out on the town together. I always thought you looked down on me for liking a good time.
No.
You?  What do you mean you, I thought...
The song.  Are you sincere with me, Fredo?
The same man who tried in Nevada... Hyman Roth, not Pentangeli.
But, you told me yourself...
It was never Pentangeli... I've always known that.  It was Roth all along.  He talks to me as a son; as his successor, but the old man thinks he'll live forever.
I don't have a lot to say, Michael.
And you believed that story.
What?
I was supposed to take the children to New England next week.
How long does this go on?
What kind of a family is this... are we human beings?  He knows his Father killed his Uncle Carlo.  He heard Connie.
Where's my wife?
We don't know that's true, he never said that.
Why didn't someone tell me!
Me too, Tom?
I've prepared this; have had it for over a month.  It won't explain everything; but indicates where I will be, so in a sense, it is my life.  Also, there are three tasks that must be executed immediately.  Pop would have given those to Luca -- You knew Pop as well as anyone, act as though you were him.  It discusses Kay as well; that will be the most difficult.  The men who tried to kill me tonight, will never leave the estate.
I don't think so.  Unless I'm very wrong...they're already dead. Killed by someone inside...very frightened that they botched it. That's why I am going to disappear in a few minutes, and leave everything to you.
I want you to reach Fredo.  I know he's scared, but have one of our people reach him.  Assure him that there will be no reprisals.  Tell him that I know Roth misled him.
Mike, at three and a half...
How did they get their hands on Pentangeli?
That plane goes to Miami...
We've never sent this much with one courier.
Yeah.  He wouldn't even go out to dinner.  Just wanted to go home.
Don't worry about anything, Frankie Five-Angels.
Do you gamble?
Do you owe markers?
I don't think that's necessary.
Sir, the gentleman does not understand English.  He would not in any case, take the stand.  He came, at his own expense, to aid his brother in his trouble.  He is not under any jurisdiction of our government and his reputation in his own country is impeccable.
Senator Kane.
Kay.
Where?
I think it's too late for changes, Michael.  I promised myself I wouldn't talk about it and I've gone and spoiled it.
I'm alright.  Will you stay home for awhile?
The Rosato Brothers have performed services for you in the past; I understand that they are under your protection.
We do favors for each other...
Pentangeli is a dead man; do you object?
Very impressive.
Is there anything I can do; anything I can send?
Let him gamble.
I do not.
You give your loyalty to a Jew over your own blood.
Frankie, you know my father respected Roth, did business with him.
Mike, I don't understand.  Don't ask me to do that.
Then why do you want me to lay down to them?
We're all part of the same hypocrisy, Senator.  But never think it applies to my family.
And?
Forget it; I'm suddenly without an appetite.  You're making big trouble, Carmine.
He supports me.
I've already rented it; I cannot disappoint the new tenants.  They're paying a higher rent.
Here is the six month's increase in advance.  You needn't speak to her about it, she's a proud woman.  See me again in another six months. But of course, you'll let her keep her dog.
What makes you say that?
Not so famous any of us have ever heard of him.
I wasn't going to try anything.
He's an artist.  Anyway, he's too old to think about sex.
You picked up that girl right in front of me.
It still hurt.  A lot.
I didn't mean to...
The look on your face!  You're not marriage material.  You're not even boyfriend material.  You're a kid. A big, fun, slightly irresponsible kid.
You and he are not doing things?
Maybe.  But I still need to talk. Do I have time for a cup of coffee before I go?
He wanted me to kill him, but I didn't.  He did it himself.
The police will not know that. They will want to investigate.
Nice place.
What?  Oh yes.
They were familiar when I painted them.  That one's copied from a Dutch still life done almost three hundred years ago.  And that's a Rembrandt.
I returned recently from a stay in hospital.
Sat for an artist.  Been sketched.
What are you suggesting?  You'll charge extra if I include a hand or a bit of shoulder.
I'm not wearing an undershirt.
Take a picture, it lasts longer.
What?
How are you, Mr. Boone?  So glad you are free for lunch.
All right, I guess.
Did you now?
Full up.  I got the hedges to do here, then another lawn out by La Cienega.
So you had a wife?
I never thought you were.
Very well put.
Ah.  A philosopher.
I think we all want to feel we've left our mark on the world.  Yes. I wish I had done more work.
You've done a helluva lot more than most people.
I assure you, Mr. Boone, I meant no --
Oh, there may not be atheists in the foxholes, but there are occasionally lovers.
It was foolishness to attempt this portrait.  You cannot force what will not flow.
Good afternoon, Clayton.
If that's okay?
I don't hear anything.
Who's that?
Is that really her?
Must have been funny for you. Seeing your monsters again.
You don't want to wait it out? Rain should let up soon.
Certainly you have better things to do than babysit an old man?
The Great War?
By the time he was ready to ship out, the fighting was over.  He missed out.
Storm's getting worse.
It's from the first World War, isn't it?
All right.  Let's take it off now.
I'm not that way.  Get it through your fucking head.  I don't want to mess with you.
Boone!  You awake?  Eight o'clock.
Fuck off!
This kisser wasn't so bad you couldn't lay under it a few times.
You coming, Boone?
If you don't believe me, let's watch this movie.  See if his name's on it.  How about it, Harry? Can I watch my damn movie?
Just what I was about to ask you. I thought you were in New York.
But the rest of it?  The killing headaches.  The phantom smells.  My inability to close my eyes without thinking a hundred things at once. It's all nothing more than bad electricity?
And you said there'd be some of me left.  Nobody's going to know me in this getup.
Please.  You shouldn't stand on my account.
Of course.
We'll be in touch, Jimmy.
Mr. Kay, sir.
No.  I expect you can't.
That's my favorite line in my favorite movie of yours.  "Bride of Frankenstein."
Oh no, I want to hear everything. You made twenty pictures in all --
I don't mind.
It is, isn't it?  My life as a game of strip poker.  Shall we play?
Quite.
Too warm for a sweater, anyway.
Okay.  "Frankenstein."  Tell me everything.
Mr....Kay?
I'm the one who got you on Mr. Cukor's guest list.
I commend you.  If you're going to pursue poofs, go after those who can do favors for you.  You waste everybody's time when you court dinosaurs.
What kind of job... ?
It seems she neglected to mention it
You have a Hollandaise sauce ?
It's about my brother ... Kip...
One more night --
Get out --
What do you mean -- ?
What for?
How's Atley -- ?
You have my word...
Not my girl anymore
Double-meaning intended --
Where you been, anyway?
Just out there. Roaming around. Building up my collection of refrigerator magnets ...
okay ...
So? Tell me: how come they call you "Freb" anyways -- ?
What color?
That's right. Only 10 exotics ...
How's it going -- ?
A bunch of strung-out hypes and stick- up men. This ain't like the old days, Memphis. The profession has lost its..
Why didn't you tell me?
And just in case you lose your keys, good sir, I can toss in a complimentary slim-jim, free of charge ...
What do you say, Toby?,
Hey, Kip ...
All my enemies own car crushers. It's like a pre-requisite ... Owwww...
Totally. I'm fine. You want a beer, man -- ?
About what?
What happened to you?
He's gonna kill you -- !
You don't think so, huh?
We do this. Then. You're finished. Then. You're clean
What?
I know ...
What for -- ?
Kip took a job. Fifty ladies in two weeks. Only the two weeks have turned into four days. And not a single lady has been snared.
That's Mirror Man ... And that's Freb ... And Tumbler ... And Toby ... Fellas, this is Sara Wayland... They call her "Sway."
I go with you --
That's what I want ...
No ... ?
"Unlock my button" ... ?
I ratchet your ignition mechanism ...
I bet you say that to all the girls...
Hear you roar ...
What are you doing... ?
Nothing. Just that if I was less secure, I might think you were more into Eleanor than you are me...
The chop-shop... Where are the stripped cars?  The rolled-back odometers? The part bins?
I heard rumors you were back. About Kip ...
No we don't -
Split it up. Any word on Donny?
Hey, Memphis. Remember me? Toby Walker. I live next door ...
How old are you now, Toby?
Not --
Why don't you leave him alone?
What? What happened?
Hey, look at him. Tommy. You grew up.
Hey, Billy. Watch the suit.
No more shines, Billy.
I'm in construction.
What bag?
What are you talking about?
Jezuz Christ!
Even Paulie, since he got out, I hardly see him.
It's only you and me. That's what happens when you go away. We're on our own. Forget everybody.  Forget Paulie.  As long as he's on parole he doesn't want anybody doing anything.
But you've got to see your parole officer in the afternoon and  I promised we'd take Judy to F.A.O. Schwarz.
Oh yeah? Anything you say.
What'll I tell Fran?
Yeah.
Yeah.
It was the first time I had ever seen anyone shot.
Yeah.
You know what to do?
No, no. It's okay.
Don't start. I told you to clean up. Look at this place. It's a pigpen. Look around here. Why do you think I bought you the dishwasher? Look. Look at this.  There's enough powder around here to put us all away.
What kind of person doesn't call?
Well you know how he loves animals right? Anyway, last week he's drivin' home... 
All right, then.
She didn't do it again did she?
Why not?
You and Morgan throw?
I just wanted to find out what was going on...But now that I'm here it seems strange, doesn't it?
--That isn't funny--
Some other guy?
Holy shit.
Did your Uncle get arrested?
What's up guys?
What'd you say about me?
Hey, asshole. Happy Birthday.
History.
Somethin's in my room.
--Maker builds "K" to the "N." N is three to the K times--
No.
--This can't be right.  This is going to be very embarrassing. Have you ever considered--
Well, I'm sorry.
My kind of background?
Just meet with the boy once a week.
Jobs doing what?
Sean, I really don't think you understand--
You see, Sean? That's exactly not the point. No one remembers that. They--
Is it Gerry? 'Cause I don't think it's fine with you. Give him time to figure out what he wants.
--And confuse him--
--Gerry--
--And here I am for the second week in a row with my professional reputation at stake--
Why do you think he does that, Gerry?
Why is he hiding? Why is he a janitor? Why doesn't he trust anybody? Because the first thing that happened to him was that he was abandoned by the people who were supposed to love him the most!
Oh, come on, Sean--
Yes you do. You're angry at me for doing what you could have done. Ask yourself if you want Will to feel that way for the rest of his life, to feel like a failure.
--Is that what this is about, Sean? The Field's Medal? Do you want me to go home and get it for you? Then will you let the boy--
That's right! You were smarter than us then and you're smarter than us now! So don't blame me for how your life turned out. It's not my fault.
I got this mailer the other day. Class of Sixty-five is having this event in six months.
I got one of those too.
Well, she out did herself today...
That's very presumptuous.
Did you buy all these books retail, or do you send away for like a "shrink kit" that comes with all these volumes included?
You think so?
I think you're one step away from cutting your ear off.
--Well, maybe that means you.
Yeah, I went on a date last week.
Well, are you going out again?
Why not?
My wife's dead.
Why not?
Where were you?
So you might be working for Uncle Sam.
Do you have a soul-mate?
Define that.
They're all dead.
I didn't ask for this.
Nobody gets what they ask for, Will. That's a cop-out.
That's what you want?
I just want you to know, Sean...
You're Welcome, Will.
Is Harvard gettin' all that money?
Have you ever seen Annie Hall?
Free?
How was that?
Do I have a lot of brothers and sisters?
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
Bullshit.
Do you know all their names?
'Cause it's nicer than my place.
I've never seen your place.
What about your friends? Or your brothers? When do I get to meet them?
You're rich. What do you have to worry about?
All right, Mr. Nosey Parker. Let me ask you a question? Do you have a photographic memory?
Well all right, Beethoven. He looked at a piano and saw music. The fuckin' guy was deaf when he composed the Ode to Joy. They had to turn him around to take a bow because he couldn't hear the crowd going crazy behind him. Stone deaf. He saw all of that music in his head.
Not a lick. I look at a piano and I see black and white keys, three pedals and a box of wood. Beethoven, Mozart, they looked at it and it just made sense to them. They saw a piano and they could play. I couldn't paint you a picture, I probably can't hit the ball out of Fenway Park and I can't play the piano--
I know. I just do.
--some prick from Stanford that your parents will approve of. Then you'll sit around with the rest of the upper crust kids and talk about how you went slummin' too.
I'm not honest?
Yes, I do, Will.
I just wanted to call before you left.  I'm takin' all these job interviews. So I won't just be a construction worker.
You doin' the hirin'?
How 'bout you?
*Some*body got to take the blame. They just *got* to hang it on somebody, you know.  An' I ain't doin' nothin' but set around.
Whatsa matter, Ma? Gettin' scared?
You're *ticklin' me!*
Tom? You can come on. They gone.
Maybe the road's out.
Short fella. Pale face.
Them wasn't two-for-a-cent candy.
Women?
House 25. Number's on the door.
Okay, mister. Whatcha payin'?
Two and a half cents.
Deputy sheriffs.
Pa always said you was never cut out to be a preacher.
I got nothin' to preach about no more--that's all. I ain't so sure o' things.
Excuse me for asking.
No, but I aim to before sundown. Gettin' kind of excited about it, too. Which way you going?
Gimme that gun. Now git outa here. Go down in them willows an' wait.
Casy! What you doin' here?
They won't. They're a-gettin' five an' they don't care about nothin' else.
We ain't campin'. We jus' stoppin' a minute--
What's the matter? What's happened?
Have it your own way, son, but just as sure as you touch my house with that cat I'm gonna blow you plumb to kingdom come.
No, my old man got a place, forty acres. He's a sharecropper, but we been there a long time.
What you mean?
An' the nex' thing you know you'll be out, because they got it all figgered down to a T--until the harvest is in you're a *migrant* worker--afterwards, just a bum.
Easy, *easy!* You wanta bust his head wide open? Pull his arms, John.
Where you going?
I know, but I got a stomickache. I ain't hungry.
Glad to get shet of him. Never was no good an' never will be--
Sump'n got to happen soon. We got one day's more grease, two day's flour, an' ten potatoes. After that...  An' Rosasharn, we got to remember she's gonna be due soon.
Wait. There's a half a bottle a soothin' sirup here.  It put the chillun to sleep.
And they's some coffee here. I could fix him a cup...
No.
An' that's why you didn't want 'em to look?
I know, Ma. I'm a tryin'. If it was the law they was workin' with, we could take it. But it *ain't* the law. They're workin' away at our spirits. They're tryin' to make us cringe an' crawl. They're workin' on our decency.
She's gettin' prettier, Ma.
I'd like to stay. I'd like to be with ya--  --an' see your face when you an' Pa get settled in a nice little place. I sure wish I could see you then. But--  --I guess I won't never be able to do that. Not now.
No, Ma. Not that. That ain't it. But long as I'm a outlaw, anyways, maybe I can do sump'n. Maybe I can jus' fin' out sump'n. Jus' scrounge aroun' an' try to fin' out what it is that's wrong, an then see if they ain't sump'n could be done about it.  But I ain't thought it out clear, Ma. I can't. I don't know enough.
Me neither.  It's jus' stuff I been thinkin' about. Gimme you han', Ma. Good-by. 
You can have this for ten cents.
Well?
But we couldn't *do* on any less'n what our share is now.  The chillun ain't gettin' enough to eat as it is, and they're so ragged we'd be shamed if ever'body else's chillun wasn't the same way.
Not be so lonesome, either, knowin' his name is there with 'im, not just' a old fella lonesome underground.
Think I'll walk out an' try to fin' out what all that fuss outside the gate was. Anybody wanta come with me?
Whatta you think you're talkin' about? I got a han'bill here says good wages, an' I seen it in the papers they need pickers!
I seen 'em b'fore you did.
Morning.
We can pick anything.
But wait. I still don't understand what you do.
Bob. Bob Destephano.
Remember high school?
What?
It's me. Martin Blank.
Never better.
Ahhh... it's all fucked up. Nothing adds up to nothing... you work your whole life, day in and day out-- try to make sense of it all. One day you're twenty-seven and what do you get to show for it...
You open 'em up and there's the sayings, stories, little bites of insight. It's the P.P.P. Six Day Week.
I'm in California most of the time. Traveling a lot on business. That's about it, really.
Where have I been?
That's part of it.
Well, there's not much to tell.
I'm sure you've done worthwhile things in the last ten years. You've had experiences.
Wow. I have to give this some thought.
Is it something you've done?
Okay. Great, Martin, that's just great. Meaning to life... Mmm....
Will you come with me?
You don't understand...
Come on.
Here's the news: He hasn't been in Portugal since '90. I know that from the file. Why don't you read the file, man?
If he does our job, he's our job.
...Tell them that's not my problem. I was paid for one job-- the cyclist-- not two. See you tomorrow, Marcella.
And sir, I also get that broken- mirror, black-cat, Friday-the- thirteenth kind of feeling about this one....
I have scruples. Next.
Yes. It's the same as usual. Nothing remarkable about it at all.
Jim?
I imagine that'd be rather difficult.
They told me you're taking lithium, mom.
What the hell happened to you?
That's too bad.
I visualized you, in a haze, as one of the slackster, flannel-wearing, coffeehouse-misanthropes I've been seeing in Newsweek.
Mr. Booker, if I could just ex --
You want us to come with you? I just have to run to the main house and give Mr. Peterson a check.
You know, we're branding here tomorrow. If you two want to come by to watch or give a hand, you're welcome.
Oh, I see, you write both sides of the conversation?
It's a man's world, Mr. Booker. Most women have to.
Lucky for you. The grizzlies around here only go for joggers.
It's all right. He's young. Just hold out your hand a little lower so he can get the smell of you.
I am comfortable.
Grace, listen to me. Your body is just healing. You have to give the rest of you time as well...
No, you didn't.
What about him?
I think that's... very compassionate and... mature way of looking at it.
No, I don't mean you have to. It's just that we may not have enough --
Fine!
I didn't know I had to.
Bullshit! It's about you! About you deciding! About you always being right! You always getting everything your way, controlling everybody -- like we work for you or something!
I'll take care of it.
Yeah, you know everything!!
STOP IT! Why can't I talk to you!!
NO, YOU STOP IT! Stop pretending like you care! Like this really isn't about you and Tom.
WHAT?! How can you --  I'm sorry if my friendship with Tom bothers you so much, but I happen to value having someone to talk to, especially when my own daughter ignores me night and day because no matter what I say, it's wrong and no matter what I do, it's wrong... I'm sorry I'm such a disappointment to you.
Started what?
Who is it?
Good.
What the hell does that mean? How much more do I have to do to prove how important this magazine is to me?
Okay. You want me to pick you up?
I'm sorry about last night. I shouldn't have brought it up over the phone.
I should go get some of her things.
You've got to stop doing that?
I come home and you tell me we're going to drive a psychotic horse to Montana! I can't just pick up and leave...
What... Bo-... What about the magazine?
I apologize for the surprise, but the days only opened yesterday and I figured...
I have so much to tell you.
You know, that's interesting. I always wondered when I went into a restaurant what was the difference between a regular steak or a Black Angus steak. I couldn't taste any difference although I could swear one was more tender. I didn't know there was that big a difference between cows...  I've never been on a cow farm before. I must say, the bulls seem to have the best time of it. Just laying around the fields all day until they're asked to...  do their... work.
Oh uh, thank you. No, we don't want to impose.
She calls him Tommy...
Ha, she loves telling this story about how when he was two years old, he ran off. They found him in the barn, sleeping between two giant hooves of a Percheron stallion. She said that horse was protecting him and nobody could convince her otherwise.
What was it like?
Annie, I'm not good at this kind of talk -- goes round and round a thing but never comes to it -- so let's just say what it is. When you first came here, I didn't like you and I was worried. Tom means a lot to me and this family. Don't go looking here for whatever you looking for. Don't make that man go through something it took him a long time to see his way clear out of the first time.
I don't think anybody can make Tom do anything he didn't want.
When you figure on branding?
I don't believe it.
She's an editor.
What does that mean?
Do you want to go around by the old road?
I don't any woman in New York. But from what I hear, most of them are wound up.
Long enough.
What stuff is that?
Cool?
Good. Good man. Alright, let's finish up here, and take him in for interrogation.
She's rabid, but cute.
Shh!
That's far out!
...and your name goes through like seventeen computers a day. 1984, yeah right man, that's a typo. Orwell's here and now, he's living large. We have no names, man, no names. We are nameless. Can I score a fry? Thanks.
Oh yeah, you want a seriously righteous hack, you score one of those Gibsons man. You know, supercomputers they use to like, do physics, and look for oil and stuff?
It was him, man!
I want it to have my children!
Yeah, I bet it looks crispy in the dark.
And what's he do?
Loser.  I can't believe you were only eleven when you wrote this. It's quite an impressive virus. Dade, I know how you might feel about narking on your friends, but, we're hackers. For us, there's no such thing as family and friends. We're each our own country, with temporary allies and enemies. I'd like to make a treaty with you.
I'm the one who understands you. Now, can we be allies?
The girl. The girl has the disc I need.
My... class. You mean I'm not in your class?
What the hell are you doing?
It's cool, I'm just looking.
Your slave?
You wish. You'll do shit work, scan, crack copyrights, whatever I want.
Okay. I'll copy it.
I'll make it up to you!
What?
Excuse me.
Yo, chill man, I'm talking to Venezuela.
I've narrowed the activity to terminal 23.
Die, dickweeds!
You think they're going to bust us?
A hacker planted the virus.
The little boat flipped over. A virus planted in the Gibson computer system claimed responsibility.
You said the worm was untreaceable!
Well you found out this morning? Why didn't you tell me before? I mean it's 5 o'clock now Rachel...shit
So?
I mean, you blew off our date at last minute.
I am different, it's just that I just got pissed off...that's all.
What's going on?
Get back!
You'll have to watch Jamie tonight.
Its too late.
What am I supposed to tell Brady? Sorry, but I've got to baby-sit my foster sister, go and have fun by yourself.
You guys always look great.
Because the lights are all out.
About what?
Now where are you going?
I'd assumed Dr. Loomis would be here.  Michael Myers was his patient.
Okay everybody, listen up. I've got Rachel Corruthers and her sister in the truck, and I'm taking them outta town route 410. State police are on the way. Got that?
Got it Earl.
Kido. It's four in the morning.
I know you miss your parents, its hasn't been that long.
Double scoops?
Rachel, can I go get my costume on?
Then we'll be safe?
He's not married. Besides, I've got a right to do what's best for me.
You remember Lindsay don't you?
Call me.
Leave Myers for the state boys.
Go to my house. We'll call the state force from there.
What are we doing?
Something?
How's it powered?
Loomis. Haddonfield.
What happened?
That man who drove by so fast, the one you yelled at.
Poor Laurie. You scared another one away.
Why did you hang up on me?
I'd say you must have the wrong number.
Annie, you didn't. Tell me you didn't.
This has not been my night. My clothes are in the wash, I spilled butter down the front of me, I got stuck in a window...
...Then you rip my clothes off. Then we rip LYNDSEY'S clothes off. I think I've got it.
Yeah.
My parents won't be back till ten.
Will you call me tomorrow?
May be a few minutes. I gotta stick around here...
Not since 1963, since it happened. Every kid in Haddonfield thinks this place is haunted.
Jesus!
You all right?
Sure...
Where were you? I went back to the Myers house...
I found the car! He's here!
As usual, I don't have anything to do.
They probably stopped off somewhere. Have her call me when she gets back. I've got Lyndsey here and I want to know what time to put her to bed.
I gotta go. I'll see you tonight.
Who is it?
What is it, Laurie?
DO WHAT I SAY! NOW!
Of course not.
PROBABLY going.
If you say so.
I see.
Wha--  What kind of things do you build?
You want to see some?
No, really, I really like him a lot.
We're a big hit.
That's disgusting!
Well, wait.  You know what?  I know.
Uh...
Yeah, we have Mr. Morris Levine's eightieth birthday party on Riverside Drive...or Riverside Memorial Chapel, depending on his health.
Gee, um...  I...I don't know what to say.
Only a few.  A few.  Do you like 'em?
I can't resist.
It's really sad.
Oh, gee, I don't know.  Um...
Y-you live in Chelsea, don't you?
You know, I saw your father this week about his sinus...
...and, uh, he complained of chest pains.
You mentioned on the phone that you'd had some dizziness.
What I'd like to do, is to make an appointment for you at the hospital. I'd like to have them run some tests.
What a weirdo that guy is!  Paranoid.  What's the matter with you?
Could you--
Really?  So, so, what else?  Wh- what are you up to?
I'm...all right.
Bye.
How's everything?
I figured I'd get, uh, Frederick and Dusty together.
Oh.
Oh!
What are you doing?!
Oh, no, no, no.  It, uh, it-it-it- it was i-inevitable that Hannah and I part, anyway.
No.
Let's go have dinner, shall we?
It's so late.
Why not?
I don't know about that.  Oh, no, I just, see, I-I've been very, very lucky.  W-when I had the kids, I decided to stop working and just, you know, devote myself to having the family, and I've been very, very happy  but...I've always secretly hoped that maybe some little gem would come along and tempt me back on the stage...
Oh, Mom!
I don't understand.  I thought that you would be happy.
I know it sounds funny, but I'm gonna try.
Oh! 'Cause you won't exist!
Are you sure?
I'm going through a period of my life where I just can't be around people.  I didn't want to wind up abusing anyone.
Why?
Oh, Christ!  What's wrong with you?!
I'm saying it now!
It doesn't make a difference!  I have to move out!
Oh, God, I don't even know what I want.
Mickey, Mickey, listen, listen.
But you don't have any symptoms!
It was on your shirt!
Tch, well, you know, eventually it, it is going to happen to all of us.
...you know it, it just takes the pleasure out of everything.  I mean, you're gonna die, I'm gonna die, the audience is gonna die, the network's gonna-- The sponsor. Everything!
Hi.  Where's Holly?
Hi.  She's auditioning for a television commercial.  She said she's gonna be a little late.
No.
How are you?
I mean, I don't know, he's seeing someone else or something, but...
Hey, Hannah, did you read that last thing Holly wrote?  It was great. She's really developed.
Oh!
Ohh!
You've always had good taste in husbands, so...
You know, where I-I-I would get implanted from a-a donor.
Fro--?  You want a-a defrosted kid? Is that your idea?
Here, Mom.  Drink this.  You know, you're awful.  You probably were flirting.
Yes, she's lovely, but she doesn't have your spark.  She knows it.  She worships you. She wouldn't dare get up there on the stage.
I know.  H-how much do you need?
Ouch!
You found all this, all this out on one date?
I've got a singing audition for a Broadway musical.  Of course, I'll never get it.
Well, you think everybody in m- musicals sings so well?
You know.
Nobody but you can do that to me. I don't know why.
Boy--
They said I was too offbeat looking, whatever the hell that means.
I'm-I'm always happy to help you financially.  I think I've gone out of my way to-to introduce you to interesting single men.  There's nothing I would--
Y-you mentioned to me yourself that you and Elliot were having some problems.
I can't hear you.  I can't hear anything.  I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm gonna lose hearing in my ear!  I'm--
Yeah, that's tough!  You don't deserve Cole Porter.  You should stay with those groups that look like they're gonna stab their mother!
And you don't have to snort cocaine at the table all the time!  What do you, what do you do?  Carry a kilo around in your purse?
...and I thought I'd come in and...and we could replay, uh, the whole, uh...
It was a terrible evening.
I'm okay.
No, I am.  I am.
Oh, no, millions of people come up to you and say, "Hey, I have something I just wrote," right?
No, I haven't.
Yeah.
It's great.  I swea-- I'm-- I'm, tch, I'm speechless.  I was...I was not in the mood to listen to this thing now.  I don't know what to say.  I'm moved and I laughed and I-- Uh, I, you know, I was on the edge of my seat.  I just think it's wonderful! I'm, I'm totally...stunned.  This is not an insult.  I'm amazed that you can...  It was-- I just thought it was great.
Oh, gosh, you really think I can write?
Oh, my God.  Thank you.
Yeah, Mom's Camille when she gets up in the morning.
Yeah.
You're afraid of dying? MICKEY  Well...yeah, naturally.  Aren't you? I-- L-let me ask you, reincarnation, does that mean my soul would pass to another human being, or would I come back as a moose or an aardvark or something?
<u>What</u> is this, a whorehouse, or are you my <u>wife</u>?
It wasn't my day.
Orderly.
...you...
He said, and these were his words, he <u>valued</u> our time together, because I was civil.
Waal, because your <u>selling</u>'em... Two years ago, his annotated Dictionary of Cuisine, by Alexander Dumas, went for sixteen thousand dollars. Seller's affidavit of ownership, signed Cary Panz.  P.A.N.Z.  Sounds to me like an Orderly.  Whadja clear on the book? Ten, twelve grand?
Let's just say they got a passion for collectibles...
That would adversely impact my income.
...aren't you afraid of me...?
You said "here's what <u>they</u> want you to do."  Aren't you part of them anymore...?  Aren't you part of the FBI? 'No Girl's Allowed,' or <u>what</u>?  Have you transgressed...?
You want me to solve all your problems tonight...?
M'I gonna see you tonight?
He had nothing.  He lived in a garret. His work was his life, he...
What's up...?
Impossible.
Hold up a minute...
You spend the afternoon in Bed?
...WHY DID HE COME BACK?  WHY DID THE BOY TURN BACK...?
Agent Starling, would you come with me...?
No, no, of course not.
You said the <u>bad</u> news...
...fraid, that's about it, Doctor.
Look at this:
She was there, alone, sir, she was in a burning building, waiting for your folks to come through the wall.  And...
You nervous...?
Waal...
You want to <u>hold</u> him...?
Sadly, no.  And I find that birth is one of the few things in life which study and a pleasant attitude can not amend. What do you think?
My mother told me to ignore the blandishments of charming men.
And how good of <u>you</u> to remember it. Then, this trip, then, is not a return to <u>America</u>...
No, this is <u>pleasure</u>...
If your duty requires it.
I'm a historian.  It is our task to assemble the seemingly unconnected into the obvious.
How so?
How could you know?
I <u>sense</u>...  The faintest <u>whiff</u> of a perfume, whose <u>base</u>, whose <u>base</u>, whose <u>base</u> is "Hamamelis" ... it is <u>witch-hazel</u>--such a clean scent.  No, not a European scent. I would say it is a scent of the New World.  I would say, you have been in America.  Have I struck home?
I'd like to walk home with you, and...
Where do you live?
...and Shirly, let me sleep with her sometime.
...spend some time on the streets.  Ask me then...
Thank you.  No, I know you'd prefer "I'm glad you <u>find</u> me so..."
I hope you'll <u>find</u> it so.  Yes.  It's <u>good</u> to see you regaining your strength...
...and my need for The Institution...
<u>Yes</u>.
Would that add to your <u>mirth</u>?
Yes, to cease to Hope is the Greatest Crime.  The Greatest crime.  Perhaps the <u>only</u> crime.  <u>I</u> never ceased to hope!
And what would be of Greater Help, than to release her, from the bonds of this sordid earthly existence.  DON'T YOU THINK?  IN WHICH THE INNOCENT ARE TORTURED IN WAYS WHICH WOULD MAKE THE ANGUISH OF THE DAMNED SEEM TAME AND UNIMAGINATIVE, DON'T YOU <u>THINK</u>?  BLIND HIM AGAIN, AND PREPARE <u>HIM AND HER</u> FOR THE PIGS! 
Because, baby, you're looking to find love in an institution, that's your only chance....
Yeah, that's too Hip for the Room.
I don't wanna go out there at <u>all</u>...
Every suicide kills two.
...the purpose of the exercise... is it because they are <u>expensive</u>...
...my love...
Then we cannot go.
....because we don't have any mmm...
The Case that I am <u>working</u> on...
And why should we believe you?
But perhaps, there is some, some less radical solution.
The great and <u>beautiful</u>...
I don't know.  Do <u>you</u> know...?
...no.
Your father.  It is not <u>they</u>, who...
What does <u>that</u> mean?
For approval.
I told that woman I'm an orphan.
But... but....but.... you're <u>right</u>.  I used it.  To <u>bargain</u>.  For her <u>sympathy</u>...  I <u>used</u> it--to "whore myself out"-- 
Yes.
I want to do something <u>positive</u>...
But.  He was a night <u>watchman</u>.  That's what he was.  N'They brought back, his hat, his <u>badge</u>, an his <u>timeclock</u>.  N'then they took me off.  I <u>saw</u>... I saw.  Clear as day, do you, do they call it a <u>delusion</u>?  His hat an his badge.  Clear as day, bulletholes and all.
It's funny, when I first met you I thought you were such a weirdo...I still think you're a nut, but you're my nut.
Adam. Dollface. We had a physical relationship that served a purpose and now...
Summer would have been a lot less without you. You're a true friend, Donald.
Make it seem you have this comfortable, mysterious life and you don't give a shit whether she's a part of it. Oh, and bring up India, Talia has this obsession...  Whoa, Donald, play hard to get, not hard to want...Let Talia know that your goofy act is just something you do for the kids....
Wha-at?  What is it?
We had fun. I even got along with Talia-- for about three minutes. I don't know why she hates me so much...
Do you really not believe in God?
Iunno.
I was thinking...if we could mesh my way of thinking with your way                            ] of thinking, we could really do some                        ] great counseling.

Gee, thanks.
Ever since Phil Collins did that MTV anti-drug commercial I refuse everything.
How's my little cheerleader? Now I know everyone at your high school isn't so uptight, come <u>on</u>.
So what was the first day after Heather's suicide like?
Because you're an idiot.
Let me get it clear, Veronica. You want yourself a sweet homeboy for this T.V. show so you can show everybody what a loose, Martin Luther Cosby-lovng place Westerburg is.
What's your damage? Brad says you're being a real cooze.
Heather, I feel awful, like I'm going to throw up. Can we jam, please?
We both said a lot of things we didn't mean, last night.
Very very. The photographs?
Is she dead?
Let's knock off early. Go to the mall. Something lame like that.
The extreme always makes an impression, but you're right, it was severe. Did you say a Cherry or Coke Slurpee?
Killing her won't solve anything.
A well-timed lightning bolt through her window and Monday morning, all the other heathers, shit, everybody would be cast fucking adrift.
Well then, I'll pray for rain.
Stop kidding around. I'm going to have to send my S.A.T. scores to San Quentin instead of Stanford.
Did to.
Can't you see this is a special moment?
Catch a movie? Miniature Golf?
It's over, J.D.  Over!
You're still not listening! I'm not..
It's all over, J.D. Help me to stop it.
That pudwapper just stepped on my foot.
Let's kick his ass.
Hey kid, isn't the prom coming up?
Any contestants worth mentioning?
Turn that back on!
Heather Chandler, Kurt Kelly, and Rupert "Ram" Sweeney all had good looks and popularity, but there's one thing they didn't have: Values, Ambition, and Hope.
That's three things.
This story of yours-maybe the school newspaper will print it when it's finished.
Look who I've found!
waves a pair of new socks around. The family laughing and talking. Pauline is not participating. She is leaning back, looking morose. HONORA looks at her with concern.
I've just had Hilda Hulme on the phone.
pulls his coat on. HONORA gives him a peck cheek.
I spent a wretched night. It would be wonderful if I could get tuberculosis, too.
I just want to be on my own for a while.
starts to cut up a slice of bacon and offers it to Pauline.
holds up a loaded fork. Pauline reluctantly takes it.
I care . . . your father cares . . . we want you to have a good education.
You're failing English . . . you used to be top of the class- PAULINE I'm doing my own writing!
snatches up an exercise book from a large pile.
What do you know? You wouldn't know the first thing about writing. You're the most ignorant person I've ever met!
I've heard your mother on 3YA. The Woman's Session has lots of lively debate.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Rieper. I'm feeling quite fatigued.
Mummy!
That.
It's so beautiful!
Let's go upstairs, Deborah. I wrote the last 10 pages of my opera last night.
Still hallucinating as well. Hmm...
What just happened to me anyway? It looked like a dream but it felt like reality.
No I need to remember. Look whatever it is take me off it. I can handle pain. I can't handle not knowing...
Well that's not necessarily a bad thing is it?
Shh. Don't blame yourself Trevor. Please.
Allison we have GOT to talk about this medication you've got me on.
I'm stumped.
Pitbull attacks.
Sorry.
If it makes you feel better that took every ounce of self control I had. Trevor, I never date patients.
Uh... eighty two?
How does feel to be Mr. Kirsty Hughes for a whole year.
But you had more wisdom than to listen to a false prophet
For one thing there were no skid marks on that bridge, the tires were all intact, from what we could tell, nothing wrong internally with the vehicle either. Like the car had been driven off the bridge intentionally.
Morgue...?
Look Larry I know you never thought too much of me. And I know this all sounds a little fucked up.
And as far as hiding a body goes? I find it hard to believe even the dirtiest of cops would keep a victim's remains hidden simply to get someone to confess. It's absolutely preposterous. Now I'm not saying I don't believe you, I'm....ambiguous. There's quite alot of money behind all this.
Ambulance.
How is our little student doing? Has he learned his lesson yet?
It was an analogy. Your soul is locked up inside you. You need to free it Trevor. You've blocked it from the healing process. That's what we need to do now. Heal your soul. And to do that I you have to give in utterly and without any hesitation or doubt. Do you know what I mean by giving in? It's about trust. Do you trust me implicitly?
Uh... sure, Tawny... what?
I... think we need to talk, there's something really strange going on...
You should give it to someone with only one leg.
LaPlante!
That's for Ga... Ms. Gayley.
Huh?  Whadda you mean?
Well, we gotta work this thing out, John.  It's a goddamn mess an' I'm halfway to doing serious time in the joint an' the TV lady's so stuck on you she don't want it to come out you stole her purse because it might break the heart of millions.  Looka those maniacs, willya?  They love you, for Chrissake!
Same with me, pretending I was you. An impulse.  Why not?  I had this shoe.
I know what he means.  I'm not a prison kinda guy, Miss O'Day.  I'm a goddamn working man for Chrissake!  Maybe I "augment" my income a little with some "business deals," maybe summa the guys I sell to are crooks, how would I know, I'm not an investigator.  You can't make it on a wage no more, not in this country.
I think our best course right now would be to focus on the Probation Officer's report...
I understand.  How often do you see your son?
Mister LaPlante, I really want to help you, but crazy stories are only going to make it worse.  The D.A. is asking your bail be set at twenty-five thousand dollars because you were arrested again while you were out on bail...
Listen, now that I owe you twenty-five hundred bucks plus, how about loaning me twenty for cab fare?
Hey!  Do I have a record?  Have I ever done time?  I mean I been arrested a few times, who hasn't? Parking tickets for Chrissake! Suspicion of stuff!  Have I ever been convicted of anything?
Bernie, how'sa kid?
I am so tired of your bullshit, Bernie.
That's what I'm trying to... to... okay, nevermind.  Just lemme talk to Joey to... to apologize.
Hey, lady, I got faults, I know I'm not perfect but I don't get this at all, your attitude.  I saved your...
You think I haven't figured it out? Just because the cops aren't on to you yet doesn't mean you're home free.  I'm a veteran reporter.  I've seen your kind before, the underbelly of crime.
You media people, you think you can just go anywhere you want, spy on people.
Were you in it?  In the war?
Here we are.  Yeah, that's a possibility.  A movie.  Now you gwan in, tell your mother I got you back on time.  Point that out to her. She was always on my case for stuff like that.  She's still like that, right?
You were saying you don't want a million dollars.
Uh, no.  But I, uh, wonder if you could up support... support a program to help the needy and...
I just remembered.  You were talking about bodybuilding and swearing.
John, I know all about it.
What is it?
He's gotta be a nut!  He saves all those people and swipes a <u>purse</u>?
Said he's not an actor.
I haven't won it yet.  I notice you've got me scheduled on a flight back an hour after the ceremony.
No dead body.  Too bad.  Not too often you guys get pictures of a body even before the cops get there. Exclusive!
There's no face really, nothing to work with.  Big dots, that's all you'll get.
You didn't... get it on with him?
I didn't ask him.
Who?
Any particular brand?
Wife, girlfriend or mother?
How's the new place?
-- hospital.
Right.  So, you have a new place, you've started working a bit -- I'm sure you'll be meeting some new people.
Yeah, things are moving along, but she's still involved with this other guy and it's a little tricky.
And how are things with your lady friend, if I may call her that?
That's terrific.  Don't be afraid to be demonstrative.  You're sounding a lot more confident than when we last spoke.
-- a sense of proportion.
Yeah, that was easy.
I apologize for that scene with my husband.  You must have overheard.
I bet.  Going into people's homes.
Not me, I fell for it right down the line.  Be a good girl and believe all the fairy tales.  He married me because I was pretty.
'"... or I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house down!" And inside their new house, the three little pigs just laughed -- '
Why are you mad at each other?
You know how sometimes Neil bugs you and you just get up and walk away from him?
I've asked him what's wrong.
The same thing -- his business pressures, the whole move and everything.  He's frantic about nailing this new job, worried about screwing over his present boss.
Neil, calm down.
You're thinking exactly what I thought when I first saw this house,
I know it's at the high end of our range --
But it's what we want.
They don't expect to get what they're asking.  Let's make an offer.
You could have a pool to cool off in.
It's a nice pool, isn't it?
Honey, the meeting today is going to be fine.  Don't get in an uproar.
No, I'm not kidding you, <u>Philip</u>.
Sweetheart, this is a very risky time for me right now.  Maybe you don't appreciate that.
Sometimes they prefer a quicker return on their investment.
Oh, space!  -- You said the right thing.
You knew a second ago.  <u>Who</u> started it?
I'd like that.
Hey, I don't have answers for this. I just brought you down here because of the sword.
What do you think?
You didn't see this.  Understand?
That's not all, Lieutenant.  Wait until you see the tape.  It's unbelievable.
Tough.
Detective Bedsoe.
When did you get back?
Yes -- I think it is.
England.  There is nothing for me here anymore.
As friends -- always as friends.
France.
Yes.
I stood up first.
I think my Sarah fancies you, Conner.
She's a treasure she is.
Where do you go when your mind drifts?
Leaving?  For how long?
Aye.
A lucky guess.
Do you always walk around with a sword?
Yes.
If they pushed the rocks you would have found them on the other side of the cavern wall.
We're holding the workers down below.
Impressive -- is it not?  The problem is I can only keep the illusion for a few minutes.  I need more power to hold the form longer.  I need the Highlander.  Where is he?
It does not come off as easily as the young ones.
Fine -- I've waited over three centuries.  I can wait a little longer.
Why did you wait?
I know.
Would you care for some water, Conner?
Yes -- when their troubles can harm them.
My dreams died long ago.
No.  The money, please.
I will, Chief.  Absolutely.
The cell phone is registered to a jewelry store in Beverly Hills.  The phone company shows no unusual --
The best.
Mars, watch the cops!  Kevin!  Watch the back of the house!
That woman's gonna call the cops.
That's why we gotta keep going.  I'm not gonna go in for murder.
Stop it!  They found the truck, Kev! They're already behind us!
Someone should stay with Mr. Smith.  What if he wakes up?
We're fucked until we think of a way out; then we're rich.
Then we might as well die rich.
I'll give you these people.
You got a sniper out there, gonna shoot me?
The cops are comin'!
You got something to say?
Is Krupchek an aggressive guy?  Hot- tempered?  Anything like that?
I heard he's fucked up.  They're taking him to the hospital.
What hospital?
Fuck that!  You think I'm crazy?!
Take it easy.  Just take it easy.  We're here to do business.
They're close.  Let me make a call.  You can see they're okay.
You're hiding, Jeffrey.  You're hiding from the job and you're hiding from me.
I don't know how long I'll be stuck here.
Ow!  Shit!
Mine, too.
He can't reach us in here.  We're safe.
Mommy won't know.  You can do anything you want right now.  Mommy won't know.
Please get away from me.
All three of us will go, but we have to move fast.  Mars and Dennis don't know I'm doing this.
How can we get out?
That's enough.
Did you find Jane and Mandy?
Other people can hear us.  Just call. <u>Please</u>.
Jesus.  He must've siphoned it from the cars.
They have security cameras.  Rooney would see you coming.
We're out two minutes, me and Dreyer.
Chief, it's Mikkelson.
What?
Slow down, Thomas.  Take it easy and talk to me.  Was your father shot?
We're okay.
Your dad has two computer disks.  They have funny names:  Marlon and Al.
I thought they locked you in your room.
Yes.
Can we let go?  You past your shock and all that, we can turn you loose and you won't do something stupid?
We want them.  You will not let anyone go into that house--or anything come out-- until my people recover these disks.
You want . . . Marlon and Al.
These disks . . . where are they?
<u>You want a blowtorch on your daughter's</u> <u>pretty face</u>?!
What happened?
Yes, it is a calamity for us all.
I used to work at the Diplomat.
Ten thousand francs for each one.
Here, here, a thousand US dollars - fifty thousand francs for my family. To let us drive off to the Mille Collines.
If the UN changes your mandate could you stop the bloodshed?
Have you requested re-enforcements?
Excuse me, Colonel.
You're fucking black! You're not even a nigger, you're African!  They're not staying to stop this thing. They're gonna fly right out of here with their people.
Their people?
They fired a rocket at us.
Yes. Where are the Rwandan police?
What is it?
No, Paul, they're afraid. They've demanded to be moved back to headquarters now.
It's a single malt, Glenmorangie. I thought you'd like it. Anything you need, gentlemen, let me know.
Yes, General. I am glad you came by. I overheard something that I think you should know about.
The police are very busy.
I will see what I can do.
I admire you, General. How do you keep command of your men amidst such madness?
Where are my supplies?
Get in.
Wonderful country, wonderful golf. I wonder - will I ever go back? What do you think?
Pack those carefully, put them in my jeep, and guard them.
You lie.
If you do not help me, you will stay on that list.
You have no whiskey?
Yes, sir. What is wrong?
Everyone must leave the hotel now.
Why sir?
We are to meet Mr. Rutagunda.
Our cards, please.
What cards?
Terrible times, Paul. There are bodies everywhere. I cannot stay here.
They do not have your connections.
I will not have them on my conscience. They will stay in my room.
Any luck?
Please, Paul, why do we have to go to the roof?
I will not leave without the twins.
The Diplomat! Tatiana wakens, startled.
Rutaganda's place?
Where's housekeeping? They won't pick up.
The French. They supply the Rwandan army.
But they didn't see it happen, they still have doubts. What we need is another body, and Steven's bloody hands right next to it!
-- what was he doing here?
I wanna know first: to what do I owe this honor? I mean, I never even heard of this guy.
How's a goddamn building gonna send out invitations?
What?
No prob: I'll just hop down the hardware store --
-- no. The basement -- the room with all the controls to this thing: big long iron levers just lying there --
-- not a chance -- there's too much weirdness down there I don't think even bullets are gonna stop.
-- you lose either way, Price --
Good point.
Or an on-line computer.
No. It's just trying to frighten us.
Where did it go?
Yeah. And under other abnormal circumstances, I think this would be the time to seriously jump your bones.
...Jesus H. Christ.
You've got your own TV show?
...birds. Just seagulls or something walking on the glass, goddammit.
Then what the hell are we doing here?
Sure know it wasn't me. And if you say it wasn't you -- then who the hell did, Evelyn?
What are you talking about?
-- I pose you the same question --
No...
I don't know, Ms. Jenzen.
First time for everything.
I think you're gonna miss the bash of a lifetime --
-- even if I give you a million as well?
He was right! Pritchett was right!
This is all maybe getting a little too strange --
-- listen to me, goddamnit --
-- it wasn't me.
No idea. I didn't even know the damn thing still worked!
Of course he did, for God's sake.  Didn't he, Mr. Pritchett?
The basement -- but, believe me, you don't want to go down there.
Pritchett: what is going on?
I feel something.  It's faint, but...it's there...
It looks delicious...
Maybe it was Colleen...
We're going to go someplace new.
What about all my other stuff?
That's father, Aubrey. SEAMUS Well yes I did.  Lived here my whole life.
What's the matter?
Well maybe we don't need to remind her of it.  She has a lot more to adjust to...new friends, new schools...it would be good if she had a stable family environment.
The heater's here.
Just because I have an open mind doesn't mean I'm going to pay some snake oil peddler to come in and shake a voodoo stick around the house.
It just disappeared.  Literally.
She has a...friend.  Colleen.
A friend?
Oh my God where is she!
Aubrey!
It doesn't matter to me.  What do you mean by that?
Are you all right?
You've done your homework, Mrs. South.
Maura.
Well, you know where to reach me. The church is a stone's throw away if you want to come to mass.
Looks like we have some animal hairs in here.  Maybe some kind of a rodent.
I know what I saw.
You'd lose the money-shots.  No.  I'll catch a bus.  Or a cab.  Don't worry about it.  Go.
OK.  Be careful.  And lighten up.  Story of your life could be right round the corner.
What will he do?  What does he want?
Uh-huh?
Uh ... Hi!  Is this ... er ... Joanne Summerskill?
I put some decaf on.  Er ... make yourself comfortable.
Your dream.  You said you were having a bad dream.
What is it?
Sorry.  It was my father's.  It's temperamental.
Oh.  You wanna talk about that stuff.
The bank owns it.  But I'm working on it.
Wow.  Lotta books.  You read all these?
I don't know his name ...  I saw the whole story.  A wounded bird was on his roof.  I could hear its cries from here. He went straight to it.  I couldn't've. I'd be frozen between pity and fear. But he wasn't.  Its pain spoke directly to him.  He picked it up.  Nursed it. Fed it.  And it got better.  Everyday he'd watch the pigeon.  Everyday the pigeon would watch him. I saw him learn. Learn that there was one more thing he had to do to make the rescue complete. And one day, just as afternoon became evening, he leaned over, opened the cage, and walked away.  Didn't look back.  But he heard the sound of its wings.
Every day.
Then you shouldn't even be around it. You know, it's ...
No.  No, you don't understand.  We're not selling it.  It came from here.  We want ...
Everything sold as is.  No guarantees. No returns.
No.  We want ...
Do you mind me talking about your stuff?
But how in God's name ...
Not quite.
Yeah right.  How'd you get this number?
Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well ... I'm fine. Things are great here.  Joey's going to get me a job at the TV station.  I'm meeting lotsa new people.  It's really great.
Good ... Good ... Look, why don't you come over?  You know, nothing heavy, little drink maybe, little talk.  Just see how we both feel?
Really?
This isn't funny.  I'm not into this.  I...
I'm sorr--Goddamn Mario Brothers. Goddamn Gates.  Goddamn Rutherford Auction House.  By the way, how many seconds?
Alex!
Whoa, you better cut a bigger hole than that.
Because I'm tired of not understanding things.  Cops, Mafia, and butlers forcing me to bust my ass to steal something, which it turns out I really didn't steal--it's fucked up.
You sound disappointed.
Count of three?
Anna, I think you better stay....
I'm a ghost.  Boo.
Alex, are you....
Let's just forget it, I mean...
Ta ta, Hudson Hawk.
Did he mention the Mayflowers?
As you know, the Da Vinci Codex, has lived in the Vatican for centuries and will continue to live here for centuries more.
The Vatican is made of constant mysteries meant to be enjoyed, not explained.
Da Vinci made the real directions in a secret script that I decoded. The way the machine is running now, the gold will produce too quickly, clog, and the machine will shut itself down.  Isn't it wonderful?
Way to go, Anna.
Good job, not pretty, but good.
The auction house, asshole.  One night's work and you're free like no ex-con's ever been.  No checking in with a shrink, no community service teaching retards how to play air hockey. It's a great deal, I can't lie.
Remember that guy in the cell next to you who hung himself?
You certainly do.
You killed a friend.  Why should I help you go for the gold?
You know Kaplan, if you weren't the slimiest pinata of shit that ever lived, I'd feel sorry for you.
If you do anything to my friend...
Something short.
Sharp.
With a little jazz.
So if you know everything about Hudsucker, tell me why the Board decided to make Norville Barnes president.
And is this guy from chumpsville?! I pulled the old mother routine --
A sawbuck!
-- and she's dynamite!
What a horrible little person.
-- these were the values that were instilled in me while I was growing up in a little town you've probably never heard of --
-- A Muncie girl! Can you beat that!
...You know! For kids!
Oh, I don't know. Maybe I was just a fast-talking career gal who thought she was one of the boys --
Oh! Hello, Amy -- was it -- I thought she said, Mamie --
We have to be realistic, Amy. You know things have slowed down a little here at Hudsucker --
...I've been watching you, Norville Barnes, even though you've been trying to avoid me --
Just give me another chance, Norville -- I can help you fight this thing. I know this last story was a lie! We can prove it! We can --
Phony, huh?
Why not, it's all true! The board is using this poor guy! They're depressing the stock so they can buy it cheap!
Whatever. That's what sells newspapers.
I've got an even hotter story -- The Sap from the City Desk.
Watch it, Archer --
Yeah, daddy, that's a roger, but we don't sell alcohol.
...What's your pleasure, buddy?
I --
...say, the hula hoop such a success.
...It is?
Say, that was a swell idea!
But, Buzz, you know I never --
Failure to deliver a Blue Letter is grounds for dismissal.
...'Shnook'? 'Dope'? 'Dipstick'? 'Lamebrain'?
No, sir.
Not even behind your back?
You nitwit! I worked for three years on this deal!
Thank you, Sid, but the reason I mention it is, it would require such a small capital investment -- again, you're the expert here --
Twenty bucks says not here she don't find one.
...No money.
Old Faithful.
She must have been beautiful.  What happened to her, Alma?
We'll see if we can't make her well, Alma, you and I.
A man, miss -- an old man who lives in the garden at Fort Holland - with arrows stuck in him and a sorrowful, weeping look on his black face.
Alive?
I think you need some help.
I'd love to.
Mrs. Rand.
Mrs. Rand...
No, this is quite final.  You see, Mr. Holland is a sugar planter.  He lives in St. Sebastian Island in the West Indies.
A year's contract -- a trip with all expenses paid -- that's not so bad, you know.
Don't worry.  I wasn't missed.  The only important man here is the owner.
I don't know.  He spoke to me last night on the boat. I liked him very much.
Why?  Everybody else knows it. Paul saw to that.  Sometimes I think he planned the whole thing from the beginning -- just to watch me squirm.
Does she suffer?  Does she know what she is?
I heard someone crying -- a woman --
I'm not sure I can make you understand.  You know what this is?
I am not a frightened girl.
That's hard to believe, after what happened last night.
I'm sorry...
It's always stood there, Miss Connell.  I can remember it in my grandfather's time and my father's. I'm afraid it will have to remain.
You didn't drive her mad.
I told you.
I have no defense.  So far as I know -- it is true.
The night you came to me in this room -- to comfort me, to help me -- I turned you away.
Ah -- that's where reason took hold.
Insulin shock treatment is an extreme measure, Mr. Holland. But -- as Miss Connell pointed out when she suggested it -- this is an extreme case.
Of the nature of Mrs. Holland's illness.  And, of course, the events which led up to it.
Dr. Maxwell is right, Mother.
Well, Jeffries, why come to us about it?  Why don't you go up to the Houmfort and put a stop to the drumming and dancing -- that's what causes all the trouble.
Gotcha George, not a problem. Tomorrow. Hey, you want to start covering the old filmed entertainment sector yourself?
Overpriced bomb, cost over $6 million -- no stars, and no one's into the horror genre these days anyway. I'm advising the company recommend reducing positions there. It's disaster films that are gonna stay at the top.
I wasn't star--
Oh not again Elena! If we've got problems, why can't you just come out and talk about them.
-- And you haven't moved out yet. It's because you're too lazy, Ben. Too scared or lazy to either deal with us or simply make a decision --
Dinner in ten minutes.
In the basement over at Janey and Jim's. With that weirdo Mikey. Not even a TV on. And they're on the floor and he's got his trousers down though thank goodness she's still dressed. Well, I really let him have it!  ... and Wendy came home peacefully... Hey, should I dress for the Halford's now, or - give me your -
Oh, just dropping off a coffee cup. Jim left it, last time he was over. It was on the dash of the car. You were, you know, reading, thought I'd just catch some air. Let's eat.
What's for dessert?
Elena, what are you're talking about?
This just isn't the best moment for this.
You're not going to --
Elena.
Oh you know, for a minute I thought it was --
Hnnn.
Well it's good to see you -- we miss you around the house and all, but this St. Peter's, it's top of the line, eh?
Here.
Have I noticed anything? I'm not married to her Benjamin, you are. I think you've probably a better vantage point from which to observe her.
Damn right, but where the hell were you?
Talking to me, dad?
Well, then forget all this stern dad stuff.
Actually it's not about work, it's advice about --
Oh for crying out loud Ben, you don't mean to tell me that your marriage is going down the drain now --
But what?
Wendy, of course. I'm sorry. You must think I'm ripe to be checked into Silver Meadows.
I thought you quit the band - I never hear you practice anymore.
I suppose my reluctance was the group aspect of it -- I've never been much of a joiner, although I still consider myself a somewhat religious person --
I hope you changed the water in that bong from last night.
Paul, cancel your mental appointments, baby. What are you, like still stoned from last night?
Paul, let me enlighten you about something. You and I exist on two opposite sides of a great existential divide, that being your pathetic virginity on the one hand and my astonishing number of sexual conquests on the other. I'm off to get laid. See you.
How can you do that man?
Aha! I could sense the vibe.
Shit. You're not planning --
You oughtta read this Hood, Nixon, our leader, all ye need know about the travails of life. Check out the Checkers speech stuff.
Francis. You gonna leave the seeds in there? In the binding like that?
Major.
Tonight? Jim, he's been out of it since he was born.
Sure I do, you know, like your aura. That you give off.
It's beyond mere physical attraction.
Did you tell Sandy?
When worlds collide.
Is this Charles?
Um, ten-o-five. Why? Where are you?
Sandy, you scared the shit out of me.
We -- we have to go to the guest room. We can't stay in here. What if Mikey? My parents?
How much closer would you say you were?
Duggar called him?
Walter Byrd killed Kay Connell.  Her things are in the house.
No.  But I covered it up.  I lied.
Thanks.
I'll stick it in the evidence locker...
Are you sure about that?
What do you want to talk about?
You know I remember that.
Fred Duggar?
I'm not expecting anyone.
That's not what he thinks.
What is it?
What if someone finds out?
"She was nice."  Wow.  That makes me all soft inside.  Ever occur to you she didn't love you back?
She loved me.  She wanted to see me every night.
Stuff.
Just stuff.  I don't fucking remember.
I don't know.
Thought I smelled something.
Best friend?
I don't know.
You don't know.
My arm!
This an accident, Walter?
Who made us what we are?
Surely you know the one who made you...
Then there is nothing.
Then God does not exist...
Lestat! You knew Lestat!
Where is she? Where's Claudia?
Your melancholy eyes...
Lestat. Oh, God forgive us.
Louis, look at me.
A beautiful child! Is that what you still think I am?
What do you want from me?
Give it to me!!!
Vampires. We thrive on blood.
What have I done?
You must get into it. It's the only safe place for you when the light comes.
And if I don't?
But we can live without taking human life. It's possible.
As did the one who made me.
Oh God Lestat. I felt peace. I felt an end to the craving.
I didn't want to kill her.
You remember how I was, Louis.. the vampire Lestat...
You'd have to have a lot of tape for my story. I've had a very unusual life.
You're not lying to me, are you?
Yes.
It's over, I'm telling you...
I want off this island.
Jeez, Ray, fourth and forty, throw the bomb.
I don't know, man. Maybe we should keep going, find a phone --
I thought you were out of town!
There's nothing between Will and me.
Work hard, huh? He's breaking your heart just because he can.  And I don't want to have to say I told you so...
Oh!
Think about this, Julie. What did you actually see?
It's okay...He doesn't believe me. That's his right. I'm starting to think I'm crazy, too.
Nice move.
Oh, stop it! He's dead. You killed him. Now, get over it. We gotta think here.
Julie, the boats are gone, the phones are down. There's no way off this place.
Ray, we're just friend.
Every guy in history who tried to pick up a girl did the good-friend thing first.
We'd have a long weekend just to sit in the sun, drink fruity drinks, and swim, and...  You know...
It's...the anniversary. That's what's going on...Take it easy on yourself.
I'm trying. I really am...Sometimes I don't even know why I came up here in the first place.
You've got a better chance of getting hit by lightning.
Julie? What's wrong?
It's...him.
Oh, Will! I'm sorry.
Hey, you don't have to appologize to me. I'm the one. I understand.  I'm going to take a walk and dry off.
Worse comes to worse, you can stand there and watch me.
Is there a problem here?
How'd you like to win a Magic 96.7 Quicky Getaway?
How's the water?
What is up with that weirdo?
He is exhausted.
I'm here. The General is here. You are not alone.
The enemy is in retreat. There will be no more fighting here.  I came here to visit the crypts. My wife was buried here. What happened to the bodies?
Another sad task. We'll bury her tomorrow.  I think we'd better lock the door for tonight. It will make them less uncomfortable.
I know it must be hard. But you have relatives in London --you've got a whole world of living, ahead of you --
If Mr. Albrecht is right, we'll all be free in a few days.  I suppose you'll be going on to Athens?
Thea -- you're hiding something. Why do you suddenly speak of your father? You told me once you had never seen him -- didn't know him --
When I close my eyes, I see Miss Wollsten. I can't think of anything else.
Suppose, she isn't dead. Suppose it was a cataleptic attack?
How do you know what my father thought - -
Mr. Davis seems a good prospect ——young handsome, sympathetic -- ready to listen to you and feel sorry for you - -
You wouldn't tell that ——
Was she ill before that girl came into your household?
There is something evil about her.
Theodosia --
I can't.
Why in the world can't you?
Come on, we got to get this up. He's coming.
Mr. Carter, Merry Christmas.
We're all excited around here.  My brother just got the Congressional Medal of Honor. The President just decorated him.
I told you –– I'm your guardian angel. I know everything about you.
What's the matter with him. I never saw Nick act like that before.
You'll see a lot of strange things from now on.
Well then, why am I seeing all these strange things?
Don't you understand, George? It's because you were not born.
Poor George . . . Sit down.
Where? I don't see a thing.
A boy?
Oh, you mean the kid that had his ears slapped back by the druggist.
That's right. Not only that, but he gave his school money to his brother Harry, and sent him to college. Harry became a football star –– made second team All American.
Now, you've probably already guessed that George never leaves Bedford Falls.
Splendid! Is he sick?
Oh, dear, dear! His life! Then I've only got an hour to dress. What are they wearing now?
Hey . . . hey. Where did the Building and Loan move to?
Thank you very much.
Of course it's the place.
George Bailey. Yes, tonight's his crucial night. You're right, we'll have to send someone down immediately. Whose turn is it?
Mother . . .
Look, Daddy . . . paste it.
Old college graduate now, huh?
Hee-haw!
Oh, now, don't rub it in.
Came back three days ago.
Hmmmm . . .
Oh, stop that grunting.
George! George!
Mr. Gower, do you want something . . . Anything?
I wonder what's eating that old money-grubbing buzzard anyway?
What do you mean, and be bored to death?
Mary . . . Mary, I'm sorry. I've got to go.
Huh?
Yeah –– yeah . . . sure I will.
Well, what do you know –– wife.
I just did, but they said you left. This is a pickle, George, this is a pickle.
About an hour ago. I had to hand over all our cash.
Just a minute –– just a minute. Now, hold on, Mr. Potter. You're right when you say my father was no business man. I know that. Why he ever started this cheap, penny-ante Building and Loan, I'll never know. But neither you nor anybody else can say anything against his character, because his whole life was . . . Why, in the twenty-five years since he and Uncle Billy started this thing, he never once thought of himself. Isn't that right, Uncle Billy? He didn't save enough money to send Harry to school, let alone me. But he did help a few people get out of your slums, Mr. Potter. And what's wrong with that? Why . . . Here, you're all businessmen here. Doesn't it make them better citizens? Doesn't it make them better customers? You . . . you said . . . What'd you say just a minute ago? . . . They had to wait and save their money before they even ought to think of a decent home. Wait! Wait for what? Until their children grow up and leave them? Until they're so old and broken-down that they . . . Do you know how long it takes a working man to save five thousand dollars? Just remember this, Mr. Potter, that this rabble you're talking about . . . they do most of the working and paying and living and dying in this community. Well, is it too much to have them work and pay and live and die in a couple of decent rooms and a bath? Anyway, my father didn't think so. People were human beings to him, but to you, a warped, frustrated old man, they're cattle. Well, in my book he died a much richer man than you'll ever be!
Hello, Mary. I just happened to be passing by.
Well, I see it still smells like pine needles in here.
George . . . George . . . George . . .
I didn't want to marry anybody else in town. I want my baby to look like you.
Sure, sure I am.
Come on, you guys.
Bring her to port a little.  That's it -- steady.
Is she responsible for the punch?
No.
If you're beached, why are we doing this?  For practice?
Yeah.
Why not?
Want to talk about it?
Sean!   Catch the rope!
It's still there!
Good morning!
Abandoned?  It's a little early in the season for that.
Rich people.  Home port is Newport, Rhode Island.
The woman passenger on the boat that blew up.
What camera?
I don't know about him -- I'm going down to the dock, maybe go sailing.
Okay, not bartending.  Why on the water every day?
May I have this dance?
Too late, it's written.
Is that what it is?  Dollars? Money?  I'll pay for it.  Take it out of my salary.
Come on, let's check the bite radius.
Okay, so that's it.
Is there one in these waters?
Sound.  Like sonar, or radar. They home in on irregular sounds, unusual sounds, any rhythmic low- frequency vibration.
Late.
Mrs. Silvera?
Thank you.  I'll tell him.
Nothing, huh?
That's what I said.  Is there any of that hand cleaner stuff?
Found one of the missing victims from that boat deal.
Hi.  I closed a sale today, without Len.  That's $1200 commission, if the papers go through.
That's great.
What?
...Everybody wants the job.  No one wants the authority. Except Hendricks.  Fine.  He can go out there in that precious boat, and when he looks whitey in his big mouth he can just call me.  Call me in New York...tell him to kiss my ass....
Hello, hello.  It went well, I thought.
I know, I know....
It's still a good idea.
Martin, could you wait here for a few minutes while we make up our minds about something?
There's a bunch of Kids day-sailing that way.  Turn them back to port.
Harbor Air, do you read?  Over?
I told you, remember?
My cousin will be here tomorrow.
Tina Wilcox.
That's what I want -- a gaff rig.
The wind drift is lateral.
Nope.
But first, a little juice....
It comes here from Cable Junction.
Untangle it and let's go -- We don't need a blackout on the island.
We'll be over by the lighthouse.
No way.  Everybody's going sailing. If you don't want to take me, just say so.
Not tonight.
They're turning around.
Eat Cheerios.
We're going to have to cover the entire lagoon.
Pre-opening jitters.
Don't forget you have your brother.
Don't let him get you.  Just continue your patterns and pretend he's not around.
You called, Doctor?
Honey... you all right?
You know, on our honeymoon, we should go scuba diving.
That we swim.
Michael, the sub's dead.
Are you coming...?
Michael...
How the hell did it get in here?
Don't think about it.  It's over.
Oh, yeah.  Really nice.  Who's your designer?  Sassoon Shark?
Here.
Finally.
How's your patient?
I need more pressure in the shark tank.
Michael, take deep breaths.
That's what I've come to ask you. Is there any large place that has a strong current of water flowing?
What did you just say before? About water flowing through them?
I can have them walk backwards.
I told you, something's upset them.
Sharks are man-biters, Mister Hutton.  Not man-eaters --
Three hundred million years of evolution have created the greatest butcher the world's ever known.
It's one of the world's greatest creatures.
I want that shark alive.
Shark bait.  Draws them over for closeups.
Lunch for Whitey.  Something to munch on in case things get dicey.
Give me a ride?
I'm Neo-Senephrened out.  Think I'm catching a cold.
I'm a water-skier.
I know!  We can take the gondola ride!
Sean, this is ridiculous.  You're acting very immature.
Take it up!
Ahhh, ahhh...
Did you see that?
Yeah, well I didn't!
Hey, what's goin' on, little brother!
Yeah, we'll find something for you.  Shoveling shark shit or something.
Took it this morning.
Sure.
But you always let me....
No fair, I'm not armed.
No cooking while you're here...No washing dishes...No cleaning....
You want to try your hand at something...?
No, no...It's too dangerous....
Don't be such a Grandma...I was always climbing something....
You just got here....
I'm worried.. We haven't had our....
I want you all to come to Amity this summer.
I'm not saying you're wrong, just that there are other possibilities....
How can you just take the plane like this?
I don't know how....
What are you doing?
Got picked up by a tribe of head- hunters....
You're impossible....
There must be plenty of women who would be glad to go....
There's nothing to be sorry about.
I made them, man....
They won't fight with me....
It's not a bad life, Jake....
How many?
We're out of money, partner.. We wrap it up, write it up and turn it in... How come your heart sounds stronger than mine?  You got two of them...?
My name goes on that report.  It's a half-assed job, I don't get my doctorate.  Neither do you....
How long?
Bring her to starboard.
I am...You must know something about him....
I've got about a half dozen...I'm going to tag them.  You hearing anything?
You fall off a horse, you get right back on or you don't ride again....
I live to hear the sound...You all right?
'A Moray eel....'
What the hell are you doing?
No way....
Who grows more beautiful....
I told you....
That bad, huh?
No, Jakie, no. I-I-I-
As I said, Sergeant, you nearly ran into <u>me</u>? What's the problem?
I'm sorry to worry you with this, but we had a real serious robbery, and we- 're chasing a white V.W. van? You guy came up an the computer, so as a matt- er of routine we have to check. Could you tell me who's driven it recently?
How about any guys on your staff?
Not for me ..
How's the new residence?
Maybe?
This looks promising .. I think this one could be it?
Maybe not? I'm feeling lucky ..
Don't start again. If you win a bet, you can't keep winning it ..
Then give me that Zippo.
What are you doing, Ross? I've had that 15 years! ..
Listen to me saying what?
Well .. I didn't know that ..
Ease off, John ..
What about Citrine?
Where's your watch?
Hair on her hand. Plus Jen- nifer had raven black hair.
I never asked if he could "see." I just asked one or two of the stud- ents if they remembered anything?
I'll sign anything you want. <u>Please</u>. Bring here her .. <u>I want Helena here</u> ..
Week or two.  Musta been on the ker- osene.  Stinks like a diesel engine.
Yeah, in and outta Frisco on the big boats .. Every lead we had went right out to sea .. Night, night, Freddy T .. John ..
Vehicle references.
I may have said some- thing. I don't recall.
I was hopin since we spoke that you might have remembered something that would give us an idea where she is?
As she's a member of my staff, may I ask what this is about?
If I came to the diner with you, would you bring me back?
No.
Do you pray?
Have you known her long?
Really? What did he say?
Why can't I stay with you?
How you doing on those shoes?
No it isn't .. It's Californian ..
You know.  I don't think we need to do the thing where we tell each other everything!
Oh -- don't forget tomorrow we have dinner with Wade Cooksey.
The power move is to go unannounced.  Black suit, right?
Okay, this is working.
Well, no you didn't --
What do I do?  How do I spin this?
No.
You've never been alone and you can't be alone --
No one has ever dumped me.
"It's okay to eat fish, 'cause they Don't have any feelings...
You hear those courtesy laughs, Jerry? There is a seething wrongness at the edges of this party.
Oh come on --
Wonder what he said.
Hello?
It's all going to work.
He's asleep.  Watch out for that lamp.
Do you have something to drink?
Well, good evening.
Look, the other night, I want to apologize.
I mean, the other night was... I felt like you understood something I could barely even say, something way down deep in the murk --  -- but we have a company here to think about.  I won't ever take advantage of you in that way again.
You walked out on a job for me, and I won't ruin that.
We'll see you soon, honey. Bye.
Yeah.  It wasn't like my marriage to Roger was so great, even before --  Jerry?
Well -- this would be goodnight.
Same to you.
If I said that, would you stay?
You want...
Why fucking not!  I deserve it.
You know how much those Well Child exams cost --
Because I'm worried that you're putting your faith in this guy who, because of the way things are going, may not have an emotional marble in his head.
Ten seconds, Rod.
At last I find you.
Yeah.  And it might have even worked too.
Well, boo-fucking-hoo.
That's your word?
I got there from "coin," dude. Coin, coin... kwaaaan.
First, single mothers don't "date." They have been to the circus, you know what I'm saying? They have been to the puppet show and they have seen the strings. You love her?
The kid is amazing.
Well, just stay healthy. I will show you the kwan.
Don't I know.  Now go home to your wife.
Damn right.
Why not --
I think so.
Gorgeous.
A year-and-a-half later, we were both in Hawaii for the Pro Bowl. Now I've always hit a wall at 18 months.  Every serious girlfriend lasts 18 months.  It's like --ka- boom.  The curse of 18 months.
"Stay calm?"  I'm freakin...
You'll lose.
Hey, man, you know they have big balloons built into cars?
What?
A friend. We were vacationing. Eric wanted to see the island and the dinosaurs, so Ben found a guy who would take them parasailing. They never came back.
Fine...and when the Tricyclatops comes after you, don't come crying to me.
Where's Dad?
I thought you were an expert.
It was this strap alone that saved my life. Got caught on a rock as I was falling.
Obviously a superpredator.  Suchimimus. that snout.
I don't remember that on InGen's list.
Know what this is?
Dr. Grant if you'd just sit tight, we'll explain this all in a jiffy.
I have never been on this island!
Just a little bit too much, I think.
You broke that idiot's jaw for no reason other than your boredom.  Tell the truth, Roland.  Aren't you even interested in knowing this expedition's quarry?
It's the lawyers.  The lawyers are finally killing me.
What?
Isla Nublar was just a showroom, Ian, something for the tourists, Site B was the factory floor.  We built it first, on Isla Sorna, eight-some miles from Nublar.
Okay, Karen is expecting you in half an hour.  You only have to stay with her one night, she'll put you on a bus in the morning and your mother will be at the station when you get there.
Very hurtful.  Your mother tell you to say that?
No.  Richard talked to his parents.
What?
What is that?
The radio rig is inside.  It runs directly from the geothermal generator, so power shouldn't be a problem.
So, you two were just, uh, telling old campfire stories, were you?
It was a payoff and an insult.  InGen never--
Trespassing, sabotage -- you could go to jail just for being here, did you know that?
What?
So do it a favor and put it out of its misery!
No.  I'm quite certain you can't.
Look, we have two choices.  We can hike back down to the lagoon, where we can sit for two days, in the open, next to a heavily used water source while we're waiting for your boat to arrive, or we can head for the village, where we might find some shelter and we can call for help.
Because it exists.
Lighten up, Ian, you sound like a high school vice-principal.
All right.  I'm satisfied with the evidence we have right now. I feel vindicated.  John Hammond will too.  Do you have enough to publish?
Maybe.  Maybe not.
Ian's a very good friend of mine.
The door security systems are shutting down.
How many lines of code are there?
Uh - - about two million.
What?  No menthol?
Imbalance, disorientation, labored breathing.  Seems to happen about every six weeks or so.
Pretty sure.
Did I say jerk?
I have samples all over the kitchen. 
There you are.  Out you come.
But you can't think through this one.  You have to feel it.
The taphonomy sure looks that way.
Oh, Ellie, look.  They're noisy, they're messy, they're sticky, they're expensive.
Oh Ellie.  It's so beautiful.  It's the most beautiful thing I ever saw.
Not just every six weeks.
- - the undigested state of the berries because it's - -
What about the lysine contingency?  We could put that into effect!
C'mon on, this way.
When people try to control things that it's out of their power - -
It's anti-nature.
Uh - - thumb!  The same way.
It changed.  Why?  Okay, back over your wrist.  Because and here is the principle of tiny variations - - the orientations of the hairs - -
You're telling me that we're facing a $20 million lawsuit from the family of that injured worker and Hammond couldn't even be bothered to see me?
In a box under my seat.
John, we - - what I'm just saying....
Listen, ahh - -
These look kind of familiar.
I'm stuck.  The seat's got my feet!
So am I going to help you with your foot?
Come on, try some.  Take a bite.
Go, go, go, jump!
Machines hate you?
I didn't say you were scared.
Oh my God!
Not just kids - - for everyone.  We're going to open next year.  Unless the lawyers kill me first.  I don't care for lawyers.  You?
I, uh, don't really know any.  We - -
It's safe?
What's that?
Timmy, let go!  You're gonna have to let go!  Count to three.  I'll catch you.
You're gonna get electrocuted  electrified!
But this is nature!  Why not give an extinct species a second chance?!  I mean, Condors. Condors are on the verge of extinction - - if I'd created a flock of them on the island, you wouldn't be saying any of this!  have anything to say at all!
I don't understand this Luddite attitude, especially from a scientist.  How could we stand in the light of discovery and not act?
I'm sorry - - I'm sorry - -
I don't know, I don't know.  I'm sorry - -
Why are we hurrying if there's nothing wrong?
You're gonna get electrocuted  electrified!  The power's coming back!
I don't think the people who live around here would like that very much...
Logging? We'll need an environmental impact study for that...
I think we're lost.
A house?
Sorry.
Doesnit sleep?
None of that's true?
Wait a minute. Let me see that. She hands him the file.
Me too. I'm drunk.
I thought you said Krueger burned to death.
I used to go hunting with my father when I was a kid.
What's that?
You work in the insurance department?
Preliminary investigations may already be underway.
Just what you've published.
I read the one about the penal colony.
An empty tomb?
What an extraordinary request!
You must make the time.  Where do you go off to in the lunch hour?
No, sir.
The <u>Orlac</u> claim.
You're a friend of Eduard Raban's.
I was having an affair with Eduard.  He didn't tell you?
Do you think people in the New Town care what happens over here?  This will always be the ghetto.
You're shocked at the thought of Eduard tossing a bomb through a window.
I have no right to be, I know.  My experience with real life  is practically nil.
Why were you given notice?
What seems important to these people is not determined by the amount of work it entails -- you're far from understanding the authorities if you believe that.
Gabriela! -- you did get away.
I know how they reward failure. If they saw this I'd be rotting in the quarries by the afternoon -- with all the others.
Eight -- and seven months.
I don't think he really had any. He had no family either.
Do you?
Why are you so aggressively unimaginative?  Eduard is no longer the only casualty.
... A piece of paper ...
-- You seem amused.
I believe we've exceeded his expectations.
What's the matter?
You must have read about it in the papers -- there was a terrible cave-in.  It wouldn't have been so bad, but even the Medical Officer for the district was killed!
This is the cross-reference of clerks who've worked on Orlac claims?
They keep switching us from department to department.  He doesn't mind because he can't sit still.
It's not our fault.  We're naturally nervous.
Hi - Carl Denham. I'm A big admirer of your work, sir. I've loved all your discoveries. I really want to work closely with you on this incredible find. It'll be good for you and good for me.
I hope it fits ... Mrs Denham's a big lady.
Father It's somewhere south-west of here - we need to inform the museum ... · organize an expedition -
We're leaving.
I tell you it doesn't exist!
Exotic lands, primitive people, dangerous animals ... That's what the public expect from a Carl Denham picture! Lead us into the mountains, Sir!
Are you nervous Jack?
Why?
Why? She's a junkie.
Sorry. 
Well it's more than loneliness. Hate. People hating me -- and watching me and following and waiting to hurt me -- you know? I'm all screwed up.
Arlyn and Jane commited suicide. He said they commited suicide.
Like for you to look for the man.
Yes.
Tom Grunemann. He wrote you some letters.
Will you let me ask you some questions?
-- Tuscarora --
Just phone calls, right? They ring, you answer, they don't say anything, just blank. Kids getting kicks. Burglars looking for an empty apartment. I mean there is nothing that proves --
-- you perverted hypocrite square bastards.
Try some other ways. 
No, I said what did you think.
-- Us city folks? The sin, the glitter, the wickedness?
Oh. No. Not that way. I'd say it was more -- I don't know --  -- too bad? Pathetic?
Then maybe Arlyn Page knew the Dumper too.
How?
Just let me know when you are going out and where --
Arlyn was a junkie; I'm not on junk!
No, you can find some other way.  Explain it to me. Bree, show me any sense to --
I'm still scared.  I mean different but still.  Look, I made it very clear from the start, you're a yokel, you don't excite me, you don't even interest me, and so I only have one question which is what the hell are you doing in my bed?
Yeah.
Mm.
I am.
Look -- yes. I mean thanks, but -- don't you think we better be realistic?
Look, why should it be yes or no? Can't we keep it going and see? I mean we can keep in touch and visit each other and see. People do that, that's realistic.
All right, suppose it wasn't Tom Grunemann; where does that get you?
It's where it doesn't get me. I've got nothing left that connects to anything.
I read your report. I had to go along with it -- the idea of this being a wild goose chase, Tom being nowhere around --
Well as a matter of --
Call-girls generally keep a book, you know, a list of their clients. Sometimes, if a girl retires, she'll even sell it worth good money. Jane McKenna had a black book; when she died it was stolen. I've been after it a long time.
Just send me a money order.
Well --
Then how are you involved?
You knew the subject Thomas Grunemann. How well?
Gov, want to leave me that one. How come he got to play with this one, anyway.
The subject got emotionallv disturbed; he just dropped out. There's thousands.
We'd expect him to work in cooperation with you. He'd report to each of you and to our Company's New York office, to Pete -- Pete goes there on a regular schedule back and forth, and --
Does that distress you?
In real life when does he hit you?
Show.
Huh?...Oh God...What time is it?
Will she pick me up after school?
I'm sorry.
I hate it.
Now listen to me, young man. Do you know what I had to go through to put this goddamn food on the goddamn table?
See you in the morning light.
Uh huh...
Like a principal?
Where will my bed be, where will I sleep?
Objection!  I must ask that the counsel be prevented from harassing the witness.
Yes, your honor.
And did you have a close personal relationship?
And how did you find his work?
What?!  What do you mean, I don't understand.
Mr. Kramer, nobody even thinks about leaving their job until after they get their Christmas bonus.
Yes.
How long was that?
Oh?  What do you call it then --a success?  The marriage ended in divorce.
You just don't get it, do you?  I - am - really - and - truly - leaving - you.
What about Billy?
Okay, I understand and I promise I won't try and stop you, but you can't just go...Look, come inside and talk...Just for a few minutes.
Hello, Ted.  You look well.
Joanna, go be a mother.  Get married, have kids.  Don't get married, have kids.  Do whatever you want.  I don't give a damn. Just leave me out of it--and leave my baby out of it.
Ted, if you can't discuss this rationally--
All right, Jim.  You said I was running this show, right? You said no decisions without my approval, right?  Well what the hell is this? What's going on, Jim?
Hiya, Phyllis.  These are the Revlon contracts.  I thought you ought to check them out.
Oh, for God's sake, Kramer. You have got to be the world's most naive human being.  Murray has gone in and changed every single ad you've done on the entire Fire and Ice campaign. Every layout...Every idea...Every single thing, right down the line.
But it doesn't work that way. A major decision was handed down by the Appellate Court in 1969--in the case of Haskins vs. Haskins.
Yeah?
No.  Uh, uh.  Tell him I asked for it Friday.  I want it Friday. Period.
How often do you see Mr. Kramer and his son?
Don't worry.  I plan to have something within twenty-four hours, John.
Ted, all I wanted to know was where--
He's okay...Thel, can I ask you a favor?
Can I do anything I want?
We are simply respecting the terms of the Seventeen Point Agreement.
To protect. To serve you. Chairman Mao wants you to feel that China belongs to you now.
Dalai Lama.
Have you heard the terms of the Seventeen Point Agreement?
Of the Tibetan delegations sent abroad, all have been turned away.
Yes. Most of the Chamdo region is now in Chinese hands. There is a report from Chamdo which makes quite clear that, unless some settlement can soon be reached, Communist troops will soon be marching on Lhasa.
I want at all costs to avoid this. Do we have news from the delegation in China?
At dawn, you were born. One eye was closed, and your sister opened it with her thumb. We gave you the sweet drink.
Is that big?
It is an island. American territory.
Where is Alsace?
What can I do? I am only a boy.
What is the size of our army, now?
I am scared.
Shall we consult the protective deities, Holiness?
I have always asked for plain information. Just the truth.
They will take Lhasa next.
Of course, please, this way. Your servant may use the kitchen.
Ah, Dalai Lama, thank you for coming so late.
You have a lot to learn about organization. How to draw out people's opinions. How to make key decisions. Train your young Tibetans. When I make contact with you, I want to reach you through a Tibetan.
I have news. The Regent has resigned his post.
Well, some say. It's not for you to worry about. Another will be chosen.
Do you think I must?
I'm on a big mountain and hitting at the bad men.
She carried a basket in her arms, a big, heavy basket, and the old monk cautiously approached. She opened her basket and showed what she had. Heads. Human heads. Only the heads.
Do you remember the day I came to your monastery, when I was a baby? And you comforted me?
It is possible, Holiness.
You are unharmed?
No.
You're a beautiful woman.
C'mon Hector.  I know you're crazy but you can't--
<u>No</u>.  If you don't kill him instantly, I'm dead and you'll only kill him instantly if you get his brain, which is about the size of a cherry.  And even if you <u>were</u> on target, a bullet might not penetrate his hide.
--<u>Who</u> <u>is</u> <u>he</u>?
I keep telling you, they <u>can</u> come on land, I don't wanna wake up in the middle of the night--
Yup.
The more he thrashes, the better.
Hector.  What you just did... there was at least some sort of a death wish going on.
I'm an empty man, Kelly, wealth has robbed me of the dream in life, I sit here broken, a hollow sack--
Didn't even <u>sound</u> good?
And how would we neutralize him?
How would <u>you</u> know, what--
Baby crocs?
Listen, uh... Hank and I think it best if you stay on shore.
No.  U.S. Wildlife is on their way.
You know they say the brain confuses fear for passion.
I wonder if he's some kind of mutant.  That bear had to be surprised.
Thanks for the... bandaid.
Maybe.  Don't mush it.
You calm down!
You wanna kill yourself, that it, you looking to commit some kind of divine suicide?
Are we crazy?
He doesn't seem to be swimming.  Is he swimming?
He's mooing.
You sure?  I don't mind...
Hank.  The little cannon you brought, get it.  Guard the shoreline.  Otherwise, we're done. We made the I.D., our job is finished.
We shouldn't even really be doing this.
I'll take it!
He just kinda gurgled.  He was pretty much dead.
Not yet.
What?
You like Jack?
Kevin.  How's it going, what's happenin', family good, great, nice to catch up, get out.
A tooth they say couldn't have come from any bear.  They say it looks prehistoric.  Like maybe a dinosaur.
I'd like you to check out this lake.  See--
Really?  I never realized he was so psychic, how could he detect that, did he tell you there's somebody else?
It was just a quick thing which we thought was over, and and...
Boy, is that smart...
Agent Starling! Telephone!
Wear it, don't ever leave it in your purse. Dry fire it whenever you get the chance. And do your exercises.
Safe, SHIT, he's got a gun! Getmeout. GET ME OUT!
How do you mean, Dr. Chilton?
But then he had to cover up, make her seem just like all the rest of them. That's what Lecter was hinting!
Might I suggest tucking your pants into your socks? To prevent mouse intrusion.
Okay, Miss Starling?
Excuse me, but I really do need to talk to you. This was Mrs. Lippman's house. Did you know her?
Your instructors tell me you're doing well. Top quarter of the class.
I hope so. They haven't posted anything.
We're trying to interview all of the serial killers now in custody, for a psychobehavioral profile. Could be a big help in unsolved cases. Most of them have been happy to talk to us. They have a compulsion to boast, these people... Do you spook easily, Starling?
Maybe you've got a knack for this... I guess we're about to find out.
If we act too anxious, he'll make us wait. He'll let the Senator keep hoping, day after day, until Catherine finally washes up. That'd be the most fun of all.
What would it take?
You'll back me up with some paperwork?  Then I'll try. But wouldn't this have more weight coming from the Senator herself?
That's why they're all so big - because he needs a lot of skin! He keeps them alive to starve them awhile - to loosen their skin, so that -
I try to be a student, Dr. Pilcher.
That expires in one week. You're not real FBI, are you?
Dr. Lecter, if you'd please consider -
Jack Crawford must be very busy indeed if he's recruiting help from the student body. Busy hunting that new one, Buffalo Bill... Such a naughty boy! Did Crawford send you to ask for my advice on him?
Five... so far.
Partially, yes. But Doctor, that's an active case, I'm not involved. If -
Do you know why he's called Buffalo Bill? Tell me. The newspapers won't say.
Then please - do this test for me.
Why don't you tell me about "Miss Mofet?" You wanted me to find him. Or do I have to wait for the lab?
Do you have something you use, when you need to get up your courage? Memories, tableaux... scenes from your early life?
Life's too slippery for books, Clarice. Typhoid and swans came from the same God.  Tell me, Miss West Virginia - was she a large girl?
No. Tell me why.
I - ran away...
Why, Clarice? Did the rancher fuck you?
There are three major centers for transsexual surgery: Johns Hopkins, the University of Minnesota, and Columbus Medical center. I wouldn't be surprised if Billy has applied for sex reassignment at one or all of them, and been rejected.
On what basis would they reject him?
I thought you might want your drawings back... Just until you get your view.
Clarice... you're hardly in a position to accuse me of lying.
I didn't get more than a few miles before the sheriff's car found me. The rancher was so angry he sent me to live at the Lutheran orphanage in Bozeman. I never saw the ranch again...
Thank you, Clarice.
Starling.
I have no plans to call on you, Clarice, the world being more interesting with you in it. Be sure you extend me the same courtesy.
Better known to his friends as the Death's-head Moth...
We leave in the morning?!
Anyone lookin' to pick up our trail, would see it as a sign of our passing...
What?!
And what were the consequentialities of European culture you didn't bother with?
Much further?
And my compliments to you...
When? How?
"Some"?
He knew the penalty for breaking regulations.  He ought to pay without sending you to beg.
Yes. Go ahead.
How far is it, scout?
Colonel Munro sent him. He was one of our Mohawk allies.
No blood vengeance? No re-proach or insult?
I ain't your "scout". And I am in no damn militia.
That is sedition! Treason!
And what is that?
Might I enquire after the situation, sir, given that I've seen of the French engineering from the ridge above?
We must... stop... soon. Women are... tired.  You... understand?
Gold could be arranged.
Is the hatchet buried between the English and my French father?
Where is that sun?! It has gone behind the hill.  It is dark and cold. It has set on his people, they are fooled and kill all the animals and sell all of their lands to enrich the European masters who are always greedy for more than they need.  And Le Subtil is the son of his tribe. There have been many clouds and many mountains. But now he has come to lead his nation.
My master requires the fort be destroyed.  But, for you and your comrades, there is no privilege that will be denied. None of your men will see the inside of a prison barge. They're free to go so long as they return to England and fight no more on this continent, and the civilian militia return to their farms.
My colors?
I am deeply touched by such unusual and unexpected generosity... The fort is yours under the condition that we be given until dawn to bury our dead, prepare our men and women for their march and turn our wounded over to your surgeon.
Well, I'll be on the golf course in the morning.  Then, if I don't have any babies to deliver--
What do you want me to say? That it all sounds mysterious?
I don't know.  I've been back and forth with Narragansett Naval all day, consulting with the best people in maritime medicine, the best people in viruses...
Doc eat already?
It's got Hazy!
Jesus Christ...
You did good...
There probably wasn't anything wrong with his suit...
You think I should hang around more with the crew?
I guess I figured if I was in their shoes that's what I would've done.
How do you feel, DeJesus?
But it's a delay!  How long? A day?  Two days?!
Personal effects...
Hey, Bo...when're you going to be off that thing?  I want to find out tonight's NBA scores and check the weather.
You read Russian?
What happened?
Bad as he is there's no way we can make our quota with- out his sad self out there. You just can't do it.
How far away is she?
No...he's really sick.  I heard him last night.  The company will take that into consideration...
Bitch!  Look what you did!
So how long do you have to wait 'till you see a return?
Let me tell you about Hatchet Harry. Once there was this geezer called Smithy Robinson who worked for Harry. It was rumoured that he was on the take. Harry invited Smithy round for an explanation. Smithy didn't do a very good job. Within a minute Harry lost his temper and reached for the nearest thing at hand, which happened to be a fifteen-inch black rubber cock. He then proceeded to batter poor Smithy to death with this; that was seen as a pleasant way to go . . . Hence, Hatchet Harry is a man you pay if you owe.
Bacon, see what we got.
A cocktail, you asked for a cocktail.
We made a deal for everything inside the cabinet.
Chris.  You come to collect something, Chris? Should I have something for you?
Mind your language in front of my boy.
Yeah?
OK Gary, we call each other Kenny, all right?
This is dangerous shit, Dean; we don't even know who lives in there.
Listen, I don't care who lives in there; all as I know it's got to be preferable to death by Hatchet.
What is the point in that? Even if it was a bug they would have taken it with 'em.
So we have a bit of a problem, don't we?
Well enough. I have been buying gear off one of them for a couple of years.
Well, what do you want us to do about it?
Where the fuck are they going? To butcher a sheep? I thought this was a robbery.
Who's this fat man, then?
You see it's not easy to take a seat at this table; the money involved has to be a hundred grand upwards and there is no shortage of punters.
Well, what did he say?
You and me, Tom.
I am not interested in what you would rather; I want to keep going. I am also offering you the money, so we don't have to turn them over because you can borrow.
All right, it's Plank. Is Willie there?
Sawn-offs are out, Tom; people like to have a bit mare range nowadays.
Of course you will look mean, Tom, you will look really scary.
What have you come as?
It's the mother of fuck-ups, stupid!
Where did you get those from, a museum?
What's left over?'
The money, the gear!
What do you mean?
I don't know what the big deal is.
You can fix old cars. Mr. Washburn told me that the cars they're making now are all computerized--
You don't sound too enthusiastic.
I am, sir.
Who's "they"?
Work hard, be good at your job. Sir. Do whatever they tell you.
Do you think you've been discriminated against on this post?
Why don't you start with that?
It's not our job to get involved in your personal life, but when it interferes with the training here--
You're dismissed.
How's business?
Colt Peacemaker.
That's not the point.
Whole different story; isn't it?
There's not a soul in this county isn't sick to death of your bullshit, Charley. You made yourself scarce, you could make a lot of people happy.
Oh. Right. And you're in--?
Rio. BUNNY Right. This kid, Hosea Brown? Does tire 40 in 3.4, soft hands, lateral movement--the whole package. Only a sophomore--
You didn't--uhm--you didn't have one of your fires, did you? The stuff I left in the garage--some of it was my father's--
Tanks, huh?
You own this place?
It's a lead mine.
I don't know why I'm talking to you, you've got that thing on your head.
Maybe.
This is the stuff we picked up the other day, right? The rest of this is all .30 caliber--
They were using M-1's, yeah--
Seriously.
They stopped training infantry there in the late '50s. It was just a playground for the jackrabbits till they gave it to the county last year.
This was a rifle range way back when. But we figured it isn't Army land anymore, it's your jurisdiction.
That where he was shot?
That's right.
Over the years, this is the one place that's always been there. I loan a little money out, settle some arguments. Got a cot in the back- people get afraid to go home they can spend the night. There's not enough of us to run anything in this town- the white people are mostly out on the lake now and the Mexicans hire each other. There's the Holiness Church and there's Big O's place.
Don't tell me lies, Enrique. Que paso?
Es mi novia. [She's my girlfriend.]
When we backed you--
Sam! Hey podner! You caught me playing hooky--
Sam! Quite a do the other day. It meant a lot to folks that you said something.
Don't think the Rangers are likely to find out any more than they already have.
We're building up tourism, Sam--
Thank you.
I don't mean Fernando.
You mind if I ask a few questions about your husband? Roderick?
He had the club out on the old trail road--
So you must remember Sheriff Wade.
You gonna stay out here?
How much you got left?
You're going to smoke an acre and a half of marijuana?
I've heard Wade was a bit tough on the Mexicans--
Most people did, yeah.
You've got your mother, your kids--
Pilar--
Two years.
Pilar--
You have any idea when your father died? Eladio?
They can't pull this on me. It isn't fair--I don't believe this--
Yeah--
What's this I see? Is that whiskey in them glasses on the Bar? Roderick, I'm gonna have to cite you for a violation of state law--
Like in nothing.  Nobody.  Nix.
Who did this?
I don't want him getting in the way.
Please.
Why did you wait so long?
Will you come to him on your knees?
Yes.  They weren't close, but they saw each other once in a while.  I think Philip believes all that stuff with the tarot cards.
When do you want me to start?
Swann said he could do stuff, yes.
I told you --
I was grateful to him.  I owed him my life.  And he loved me. He couldn't always show it, but he felt it.
I was so afraid.
Are you all right?
I'm here, Harry.
...yes?
I'm a private detective.  I was hired to follow somebody for a few days.  A guy called Tapert. Insurance fraud.
No.  I'm saying they were always fake.  The saints, the messiahs, they were just illusionists.
You tell me.  No?  I thought you'd maybe have a theory.
Nah.  You're driving it too carefully.
Are you sure?
You're a detective, with no clues. Where else are you going to look? I'm going to keep this brief.  Here's thirty thousand dollars.
What for?
And then... because I was getting too close to something --  --or someone, you called Swann
Shut up.  We've lost enough lives already.
What's her problem?
My God.
Or murdered, like Nix.
It's me betrayed him.
Nobody's better off this wav!
He did something with the ground.
I don't know.
There's other guys as good as me, Loomis.
Have we met before?
Only I forget.  They give me pills, you know, to keep me... even... and... I forget things,
Fuck you.
You could still help me do that.
No!
Bob, it's me.
You'll do it?
My husband's here for work-he's a photographer- and I just came along...I'm not really doing anything right now, and we have some friends who live here.
Thanks. I'm sure your mid-life crisis will work out,too.
Not really. How long are you here for?
I'm here for the week.
A Soul's Search: Finding Your True Calling - are you reading this?
I don't want to go home.
But the first time I saw you was in the elevator.
Really?
Oh.  Well... they were dancing on the couch with that weird English guy who kept talking about hanging out with the Sex Pistols on Kings Road...
We established that we have no communication.
That's nice. My parents were always traveling, they weren't around so much.
What happened to your toe?
It's bad isn't it?
Do you ever see him?
I'm going to Daikanyama, do you want to come walk around?
Well, I guess she's more around your age...  You guys could talk about things in common, like growing up in the fifties.
Well... have a good flight.
Yes?
Mr. Kazuzo sent me.
It's really hard to reach you... Did you get the carpet samples? I like the burgundy.
What are you talking about?
I have to go, Adam's tormenting Zoe, I'll talk to you later. Are you going to be Ok?
Do you want to- 
Ok. Maybe I'll walk down with you.
I went to a temple today and I didn't feel anything.
Will you please stop smoking?
A Soul's Search: Finding Your True Character and calling? Is this yours?
Mmm, I love Cristal, let's have some.
Oh, wait, can you hold on one sec?
Hmmm.
Did she waltz in or fly on little bat wings?
Yeah, I appreciate it.  Thanks, Josef.
I can't believe Will killed him.
I'm gonna have to get a restraining order.  What a nightmare.
You need to believe in something besides yourself.
Must be a spare set.
She's been stalking you, Peter.
Listen to me, I love you, Peter, I'm trying to protect you!
Nonsense, it's all of our home.  So how's work treating you?
Yes.
I can take care of myself.
Your court order, Dr. Allen.
It's the patient's request, doctor.
If you really believe in God, why is it so inconceivable that his enemy is just as real?
But it's true.  I have no faith.  It's strange.  When that gun was pointed at my face tonight, I was surprised, but never frightened.  It was as if I knew nothing could possibly happen to me and...in that one moment I didn't care about anything.  Not eve my own life.
So all that bullshit about God and faith.
You raised me, like a son.
Don't worry...about the transformation, Maya.
So, if Christ won, that means, what does that mean, Father?  That Satan...
Peter...Peter Kelson.
I saw you on television yesterday.  You were brilliant.
That there is no such thing as evil with a capital "E."
Not the most popular opinion, but yes.
Where do you get off pretending to be my secretary?
Why did he try to kill me?
At the exorcism, Birdson boasted that Satan is about to take over the body of a man.  You are that man, Peter.
What?!?!
You're about to become the anti-Christ who is born unholy and becomes the door to eternal suffering in this world.
I don't understand what's going on.
But I was baptized.  And I certainly wasn't born of incest.
The only baptism he ever performed in seven years as pastor at Bedford.
And if what you're saying is true, what would happen to me?
I'm scared I'm slipping back.
We're going to do this.
No oxygen to the brain.
Why didn't you just go along with Townsend.  Get rid of me.  I would've...
So, what does it mean.  The ark sank and the sun set?
I know who he is.
We need all the help we can get.
I'll be at Bedford tonight, if you need me.
No, the less mystifying.  Good and evil are only illusions.  There is no such thing as evil with a capital "E."  That suggests some third party bad guy pulling all the strings.
Would you sign it for me?
Hey!  Mr. big shot.
So, Viznick's got a meet with his lawyer in the ayem.
What's up?
nothing.
I don't know why I keep hoping you'll grow out of this tomboy thing.
What?
Yeah.  Can't wait to see him  I just saw Quincy.
Yeah, you met her?
No I don't.
Okay.
So that means it's alright for you to act like that?
...we moved back here when Quincy was about five, after Zeke was traded. Neighborhood was a little more mixed back then...
Until the Black family down the street became the Black family next door.
Oh, me too.  I used to cook for my friends' parties and things back in Atlanta.
You're a caterer?
You know, girl, long as I've lived next door, I've never seen the inside of this house.
What?
That was nice.
I don't know sometimes.
Yeah, brothers are lined up at my locker.
How'd you get him to say yes?
I told him you looked like me.
You do.
And what am I supposed to say to the man?
You only have one game left and you haven't been recruited.  Munchkin, I wanted it as bad as you did, but we have to face reality.
I was just playing ball.
I know.
Yeah, four years ago.  They had me staying in this tiny-ass town with like fifty people.  I'm not playing, there was about a thousand goats running around, and it gets dark at four o'clock.  Then the whack club I'm on loses three games in a row and I get blamed.  So they fire me.
So...does it hurt?
I don't know.  A lot.
Man, forget you then, stupid.
Didn't know you cared so much.
Hey.
Yeah, the DJ's kinda whack, though.  So who is this clown?
Figures.
You finish the reading for E-con?
Then prove her wrong.
What are we playing for?
Didn't realize you were watching the clock.
Look, this party's whack.  You ready to go?
Oh, Kerry, this is Monica.  Monica, Kerry.
Talk to your new girlfriend.
Least she had time for me.
Stay!
Least you got your priorities straight.
I'm going through a lot of shit right now, more than you have time for.
Yup.
Oh yeah?
What do you mean?
A rest?
Strong enough to get you down the aisle?
It's a trip, you know?  When you're a kid, you see the life you want, and it never crosses your mind that it's not gonna turn out that way.
So why'd you give up ball?
you woke me up to tell me that?
You're out of your mind.
You once said the reason I beat you was because you wanted me to.
With who?
What is this?
You scared me.
Sorry.  You okay?
You know how much higher the play level is in the NBA?  Give yourself time to develop, Quincy.  Get an education.  The NBA ain't going nowhere.
Why?
I messed up, okay, I know that.  But I ain't that kid's father.
I ain't a damn liar.
Good.
Quincy.  I know you left school early to throw your middle finger up at me.
Don, you got hit by lightning that time in Tahoe, you went on vacation, I don't think braces is a good idea --
You smell like trouble --
No, no, no. I'm fine. It's small, I wanna keep going --
You fuckin' don't do that. You don't do it, you cocksucker. I'll fuckin' kill you with my barehands.  Go. get the fuck fuck -- we're going back and we finish the show --
I know -- and I can't really explain that, but I have a feeling there's something, some situation between them, like they don't really know each other much or well, something like they don't talk much anymore --
Uh-huh.
My mother had breast cancer.
Yeah, hey. Chad.
I'm dying, Claudia.  I have cancer. I have cancer and I'm dying, soon. It's metastasized in my bones and I --
Your mother wants to hear from you --
What?
Well if you keep listenin' to the music that loud you're not only gonna damage your ears but your neighbors ears.
Claudia: Why don't you let me handle the questions and you handle the answers, ok?
Bit messy.
Yeah.
Oh, it'll be fine, I'm sure, Claudia.
Many times, in damestic abuse situations the young lady is afraid to speak, but I have to tell you that, being a police officer, I've seen it happen: Young woman afraid to speak, next thing you know, I'm gettin' a call on the radio, I got a 422 --
It's not my boyfriend -- and it's not anything -- it's over.  Really. It's not.  He won't came back.
Do you wanna go tonight?  I mean, are you working?
Billingsley's?
To not do that.  To not do that that we've maybe done -- before --
I didn't mean...it's seems vulgar or something, I know --
That felt good to do...to do what I wanted to do.
Wanna kiss me, Jim?
please, what is it, please --
I want a shot of tequila too.
I'm fine. Yes. I'm fine.
Richard, shut it and keep it down.
GIVE US YOUR MONEY.
Put me on the payroll, find out, find out wassup --
I'm trained, I'm ready to go, you wanna buy some candy to help underprivelaged youth in the --
They don't have substitute teachers where you go to school?
No Can Do.
Oh, you're a rapper, huh?  You got a record contract?
I'm almost done.
Just throw some money around. Money, money, money.
-- the kind of love that makes you feel that intagible joy.  Pit of your stomach. Like a bucket of acid and nerves running around and making you hurt and happy and all over you're head over heels....?
What?  What does that mean?
"It's a dangerous thing to confuse chidlren with angels..."
If you're happy with Phil taking care of him and helping you, that's fine, but contact Hospice to arrange for the body --
...ah...
I don't know...I mean, he's around, he's here, in town, y'know, but I don't know...he's a tough one...very.... Do you have a girlfriend, Phil?
"yeah."  the fuck do you know?
I think you have the wrong number.
Alright.  Thank you.
That's fine.  It's nice to meet you.
If you're up to it, I've got us set up in a suite upstairs --
So boring, so useless --
This is how you wanna spend the time, then go, go, go -- you're gonna be surprised at what a waste it is -- "The most useless thing in the world is that which is behind me," Chapter Three --
Hollywood, mainly.
Are you close?
I wouldn'tve asked --
Oh, yeah.  No, no, no.  They wouldn't --
They wouldn't?
For six months.  I'm the day nurse...
Um...soon tonight...I think, yes? Tommorrow...I mean...very soon...very...
I'm really sorry.
I am calm.
Are you lyin' to me?
I live alone.
No I Said.
I didn't do anything.
And what about screaming?
You just woke up.  And what'd you have a party last night, the way this place looks?
You on any medication?
Been drinkin' today?
No. No. Stay down, Marcie, sit back down on that couch --
Come home soon after the show.
I love you.
Was there anyone that I know?
It's over becuase...for all the the right reasons I hope, what I said.
I don't.
Why, well I think we've, we both don't know...what do you mean?
I'm asking you.  I'm asking you if you know why Clauida will not speak to you....please, Jimmy....tell me.
Yes you do....you do and you won't say.
I'll get it because I'm a good actress, Richard.
....it's alright....
yeah.
That's it.
I got an audition, I won't make it here 'till two, c'mon, I'll see you later. Love you.
You coulda been in front --
Hi.
...fuck you mean, it's raining frogs?
It's raining frogs from the sky.
....what the fuck, what the fuck....
He is your brother!
Your Majesty...
I grow closer to my target, your Majesty.
Then you are a fool -- a fool who has never lost a son.  What gives you the right to judge me, to play God with the lives of others?  Is it because you are so much holier than everyone else?!
And people close to him, who --
In a year, maybe two, I could teach him enough to --
Now.  You were saying?
The mask is terrifying... especially when unexpected.  Do you notice?
Aramis -- the King wishes to see you.
The greatest secret of life is who we truly are.  Now I must give you that secret, which has been kept from you your whole life.  It began on the night when Louis was born.
Who?
That must be Raoul!  Raoul!  Look, d'Artagnan's come to visit...! What's wrong?  You look awful!
Die?  What...?
Perhaps not as much as you might imagine.  When tutors answered every question except those about who I was.  When I was imprisoned in a way no other man had ever been, I knew there was something different about me.  But a king...
Phillippe...?
Then there is one more thing, of an even more personal nature.
There is more to love than he knew, or that you know.
I want all these passages sealed! Another stupid idea of my father's! Seal them all, every one!
Even the bedchamber passages!  Let none remain!
... You knew you had a double?
Not once have I ever asked anything for myself.  I ask now.  Forgive this man, this prisoner... your brother.
What number did you tear out?
Well yes, of course, Majesty, and I'm sure they are content... except that... well, they are starving.
Ah yes, the riots.  We have food stocks on the wharves right now, no?
The food doesn't please you?
We ran the i.d.  I could have told you that.
If what you're saying is true, then why would he have killed two police officers? A man like that would want to lay low, if he was planning some kind of damn sabotage mission!
Why didn't you call for back-up! What were you thinking, Jesus!!!
Sarah Williams left the bar with Trudell on her own.
These crowds are going to make it a bitch!
When did you join the force?  You know, the police force, the place you work...
Nineteen eighty four.  What fucking difference does it make?
Outside hacker?  What the fuck are you talking about?
And he took a swing at you?
Yeah...the guy was psycho - I was just tying to protect the girl...
No Zydowski I didn't read today's paper - it's just going to irritate the hell out of me.
Something I don't already know?
Who is it?
Well you figured wrong!  And now I'm public enemy number one.  You have an answer for that?
I had to get away!  My life was in danger!
Six months ago, a police lieutenant named Charles Fletcher was found dead in a hotel room - he blew his brains out - left no note, you may have heard of it...
Yeah.
Well where are ya, what are ya, drunk?
No...I'm in some trouble...
Just what did you get yourself into, Jimmy?
I hope you haven't lost your touch with this stuff.
OK, I'm logged on to the municipal network.  I'm showing sixteen people with the name Sarah Williams in L.A. county.  None of them live in Hollywood.  Do you remember the address?
Are you going to be alright?
Where did you learn to fight like that? JIM  I read a book.
Ditched you?
Remember when you asked for a study on him, I refused. Same goes for now.
How are Molly and the boy?
It has to be a book the Tooth Fairy would know Lecktor has in his cell.
Aniline dyes in the inks in felt-tip pens -- which is what Lecktor has -- are transparent to infrared. The Tooth Fairy's ballpoint isn't...
Where?
Somebody hurt him?
If you can't look anymore, I understand...
He's working on the single print index. What time is it?
No other possibilities?
The mark? Yes.
Run it.
What'd it say?
Tell me now.
He's very careful, very... designed when he chooses.  If we find out how he finds them, then we'll find him.
Because a steel door and deadbolt were there when they were killed.
It's getting late and...
It's the guard in the storeroom.
It does, doesn't it?
Can you give me an idea of the conditions...
The activities of nocturnal animals.
I'll probably go back to it someday.
Ready to tell me what kind of 'outing' this is?
I'll get my purse.
I want to see you, too, Francis... Should I come over?
YOU GIVE ME HER AND THE SHERMANS! YOU BETTER GIVE ME BOTH!
What am I doing here?
Yes.
No. I don't want to see you.
Look at the screen. That is William Blake's 'The Great Red Dragon and The Woman Clothed with the Sun.'  Do you see?
Oh, God.
You did very well.  I apologize for the crude images.  Next time I'll have film stock that doesn't need lights.
You will tell the truth?
No.
Linda King's desk.
She doesn't have a Rolodex.
Now I'll bet it has his home address there, too
I don't want to do that,
The Commissioner was saying you were the one that caught Dr. Lecktor three years ago.  He killed nine people, didn't he?
Nine that we know of. Two didn't die.
What about the dog?
Was the dog wearing a collar with the Leeds' name on it?
I said you are fine, he should leave you the hell alone.
Huh?  Will? Is that you?
Me, too. And very erotic...
And... where are things?
Today's Wednesday. By Friday I ought to...
That's not true.
I'll come inside with you, if you like, but Mr. Crawford said you'd probably want to be alone.
Are you George Sherman?
I was in the psychiatric wing. It bothers you, finding out I was in there... doesn't it?
I told my dad before he died, I'd take care of Mom. And I'll do it.  This guy wants to kill you?
With a knife.  I found a curly piece of metal in the clothes of one of the girls. The kind of shred a pipe threader makes. I was taking a look at steam fitters, plumbers. It took a long time. In one place there was a resignation letter from a man named Hobbs. I saw it and it was..., peculiar.  I was going up these stairs to Hobbs' apartment. I was halfway up when he shoved his wife down at me. She was dying.  I sent the officer with me to call a SWAT team. But I could hear kids in there and screaming. I couldn't wait.
What kind of coffee do you like?
Yes, I thought so.
No.
May I keep the file?
I want to help you, Will. You'd be more comfortable if you relaxed with yourself. We don't invent our natures, They're issued to us.  Along with our lungs and pancreas and everything else. Why fight it?
You should, Will. God's terrific!  He dropped a church roof on thirty- four of His worshippers in Texas last Wednesday night. Just as they were groveling to Him and singing a hymn.  Don't you think that felt good?  He wouldn't begrudge you two measly murders.
Caspiar?  I haven't heard of that.
I'm -- Fonzie? GEORGE NO!  The Fonzie!  The crazy breakout character!  The guy that all the kids impersonate and put on their lunchboxes!
Are you makin' fun of me --?  This is RIDICULOUS!
Look, I'm sorry.  They're assholes! But we work in a creative business. You can't predict what people are gonna like --
WRONG!  You haven't given them any clues that it's a parody!
I can't move my arm.
What are you talking about?!  We just met an hour ago.
What do you mean?
Do I wanna go to Memphis and get married?
You're NOT DYING!
GET OFF!
My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --!
Sure, because your new stuff's a bunch of crap.  Kaufman, people are sick of you.  The wrestling... the hoaxes...
It is apparently not working.
Look -- I gotta be clear with you. Tony Clifton is NOT Andy Kaufman.
We had a deal!!
Look... I don't know what your problem is...
Isn't Tony Clifton going on Taxi soon?  Maybe that'll chill him out.
Why...?  Andy, why...?
What's in Memphis?
"Bob"?  BOB!  Bob bob bob.  Bob what?
I'm just doing my job.  You gimme that Juris-my-dick-tion and you can cram it up your ass.
He had an accident.
No, it's all right.
How?
Just get me outta here.
Yes.
All right --
We found him, Trinity.  We finally found him.
How long?
Who's coming for me?
Stand up and see for yourself.
I'm not sure, but if you don't want to find out, you better get out of there.
What are you doing?
I know what you're trying to do --
Yes.  She's very old.  She's been with us since the beginning.
The beginning?
What did she tell you?
Morpheus, the Oracle... she told me --
I'm going to make the call.
What?
Of what?
They're watching you, Neo.
Get this thing out of me!
A black cat went past us and then I saw another that looked just like it.
We can't leave him!
No, Neo.  That's not true.  It can't be true.
Why?
What are you doing?
Morning.  Did you sleep?
Which way?  Which way?
What just happened?
It's obvious that the girl doesn't want to accompany you, isn't it?
Well, we got $40, and we wanna buy...
Uh...can we give you a check?
Jewish...
Yeah.
Take it easy.  I only asked because maybe I could, you know, let you have a little something.
Hey...no more good times like before.  Until you come back.
Waddaya think?
Hey...you got nothing here.
Let's get out of here.
I swear to God Charlie...my arm still hurts from the car accident...that's why I didn't go to work.  I swear it.
You threaten me with my uncle? After what I'm doing for you?
Take it.  I'm doing it for you, stupid!
Charlie, twenty-eight bucks is nothing.  The only way to do it is through your uncle...think about it will you?
No, I just want to help myself, that's all.
Don't you move!!!
Hey, shut up.
Disgraceful.
Oh Michael, look...
Be seeing you and Johnny tonight... here...right?
Diane, how are you feeling?
Fine.
I know.
In a little while...I'm gonna have the opportunity of opening my own place...not here...much nicer than this...uptown...sort of nite-club and restaurant and everything.
Hey, where you been?
...but it's the same thing, all the same...they're in there by having something on somebody...and when that doesn't work...they fight...Our life has honor...we have no show to put on because we do what we have to do.  They know where to come when they need us.  I realize this during the war...World War II...Vito Genovese... during WWII he worked with the government, taking care of the docks...
Teresa.
Nothing.
"Francis Macomber."
Well...with the hotel that's ten... fifteen...
Maybe, who knows.
Charlie...?
Anything specific?
It was nothing.  I'm almost finished.
Take your time.  I don't care.
I'm going to take that apartment uptown.
You know why...with my parents.
You've been running round too much. Bet you've been forgetting your medicine.
Lower the fuckin music--I can't hear nothin.
Scumbag--
Isn't it enough to be on this earth sixty-five years without having to be reminded of it.
What, honey?
From the Korean War.
Of course.
You know, we're going to give this party for you whether you like it or not.
That you've been to Susan?
What do you do that for?
Bill's birthday is the day after tomorrow.  There is a provisory by- law in our charter.  Per the discre- tion of the Board, Corporate off- icers can be retired at age sixty- five.
I didn't say.
Cold.
What an odd pairing.
'Yes' to the deal?
As close as a deal could be.
I'm not interested in the details. And I'm not interested in the big picture either.  What I am inter- ersted in is how my Board got conven- ed behind my back, is entertaining a further proposal from a man whom it offends me to do business with, moreover has the audacity to present this to me like a prize fish, and I am expected to clap for it like a performing seal.  No, thank you.
Well, I guess he's found one.
We'll do it together.  I'll clue you in.  Timing's got to be right.  The old man says it's up to Joe.
Quince, you can't unscramble scrambled eggs.
You wait here'n to take us?  Like you bus driver to dere?
She knows you real self?
Good morning, Mr. Parrish.
-- And call my family, I'd like them to come over for dinner tonight.
'Love'?  Oh, man, I've got troubles of my own.
Yeah, it's like you know every inch of each other's souls -- and then you're free.
Not the one I met this morning, hit- ting on me in as nice a way as I've been hit on in a long time, but the moment you find out I'm my Dad's daughter, you act like a stranger.
I guess what I'm trying to say is -- I'd like us to be friends.
Goodnight, Joe.
Yes?
I came to see you.
Very well, I'll watch.
Watch me do what?
Well, now I am sorry.  For intruding on you this afternoon.
I mean I appreciate that.
Yes?
Did you like making love to me?
More than you love peanut butter?
I love you in an evening gown.
We know so little about each other --
What will we do?
...I'm sorry, I'm a little discon- certed, that stuff between you and Susan -- uh -- threw me.
And - uh - I  guess, 'goodnight'.
I guess so.
Of course.
Yes, Bill.
I thought you'd heard a trillion times --
You were just curious?
You tell me, Bill.
I couldn't sleep.
Yes, and stop repeating everything I say, and turning it into a question. Spooning, fooling around, God knows what.  You arrive on the scene -- why you picked me, I still don't under- stand --
May I remind you this is not just a dispute with a putative suitor, this is me.  So watch it...Bill.
-- I have the feeling that, all in all, what I made this voyage for -- has served its purpose.
How perfect for you -- to take whatever you want because it pleases you.  It's not love --
An offense --
Am I dreaming this?  Are you a dream?
'...I know, it's none of my business.'
I don't!
Where are you?  Are you there?
What the hell are you talking about?
How're you doing--?
Thank you, Quince.
Eddie?
No, I'm going to stay down here, keep my finger in the dike and maybe by Monday, the waters could recede.
So what's wrong with that?
It'll come back, Daddy.
I'm sorry --
Nothing to be sorry about.  That's the way with men and women, isn't it?
How'd you know?
I've got to go --
Sure, I'll give you the name of a doctor.  ...And I don't want to examine you.
MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99 85.
69.
Hiya.
How long have I been here?
This isn't your room. You're in 304. I Fucked up.
This isn't my room?
Leonard, it's Burt from the front desk.
And he says you're gonna wanna hear what he's got to say.							   *
Who did this to you?
Interested in buying one?
Do you remember me?
Yeah, I remember you.
Take the money and walk away!
Guess I don't have to worry about him anymore.
You decided to help me. Trust yourself. Trust your own judgment. You can question everything, you can never know anything for sure.
He went to meet somebody and didn't come back.
I told him about your car.
That's easy for you to say! You can't get scared, you don't remember how, you fucking idiot!
Mrs. Jankis, what do you want from me?
It's good.
Things change.
It's weird, but if you don't eat for a while then your body stops being hungry. You get sort of shaky but you don't realize you haven't eaten. Have I told you about Sammy Jankis?
Well, the other day you made it sound like you thought somebody might be trying to set you up. Get you to kill the wrong guy.
Think so? You don't know? Didn't you write it down?
I'll ride with him. You follow.
What's wrong with this one?
What do you mean "bad news"?
No. Don't worry, I'm a cop. Everything'll be okay. Is he still breathing?
Sammy was a con man. A faker.
I never said he was faking! I never said that!
No. You took them out.						  *
Okay. We clean him up, untie him and			   * march him out with a gun in his back.			  *
* Thank you.							    *
I was the kids' godfather.
What do you think?
Get me Air Support...  We'll be airborne and assault the ambush...
So...?
We want it back.
Bodeguita del Medio.  It's the <u>only</u> place for mojitas...
Havana?  Cubans don't like us or my business...
Were you born in Havana?
You know how improbable this is...?
...'cause we have no future...are of today and not tomorrow.
'Cause we <u>guarantee</u> every load.  Anywhere, for any reason, it comes up short, we make good.  Your operations will, from now on, run risk-free.
...to fall back on.  You know, a fail-safe.  Insurance.
Something like that.  The odds catch up with you.  The odds are like gravity.  You can't negotiate with them.  So...at some point, you should cash out, take your money and run...
Really?
Is this the protective male talk?
This is the talk of a man...if he were your husband...he would never put you at risk.  He would never put you within a thousand miles of anything that could hurt you.
José...
He tried to..."do business"...with you.  Around ten.  His place.  Be there.
How 'bout this?  How'd Neptune know where to hit us?  Huh?  Whose Op sec's got a leak?  Yours?
You got something to say, José, let's hear it.
How lucky's Miss Universe gotta be?
Stevens?
And we didn't come down here to audition.  Business auditions for us...  ...and know who we are and know they want their load run by us <u>before</u> Nicholas calls.
And specialize in very fast go-fast boats for coastal runs.
To the limit.
No.  Havana, Louisiana.  Don't we have a meet?
...where you're makin' a move on the wife of Archangel de Jesus Montoya?
Do you <u>believe</u>...I have forgotten I am a cop?
Too fast.  Too many moving parts.
Detective Crockett.
Guy's involved in a "meet"...
Meet and greet.  "I flash you some of mine, you flash me some of yours?"
OMGs, Mongols, Nazi Low-Riders, prison gangs?
Get into business with this crew, identify them.  Illuminate their network.  If you're lucky, discover their source, how they penetrated us.  We'll indict and take it from there...
Never heard of him.
Who said, "go exploring"?  We want this staying on track.
Break your encryption?  Hack your e- mail?  Employee databases? Somebody on the inside?
What flowers?
...even if they could run the identities you built to EPIC, all they'll find is more cover... Trust what you built.  It's quality, girl.  We're cool...
Why?
Define small.
You set this up!
Uh-uh.  No predetermined places and times to meet.  Give me their heading and radio codes and I will talk to them directly with the longs and lats and time which will be a last minute deal...
What the hell did you do?
Alonzo...
You're hoping to get a look at what?
Beg pardon, ma'am?
Lotta rich women back there...
You're not looking for the Statue of Liberty at all.
He's got taxi fare.
You think I'm lying!
Maybe we should take a little nap, see what happens?
That is one hell of a shirt. I bet you paid a pretty price for it, am I right?
For what?
How would I know? You gotta tell a person these things  A hustler? Picking up trade on the street like that -- baby, believe me -- you need management.
Miami Beach is the only place for a real hustler. Florida has more rich chicks per square yard than any resort spot in the world. They lie out in their pagodas and pergolas waiting to grab the first jockstrap that passes.
What of?
Just when everything's going my way, you gotta pull a stunt like this.
I mean New York's one thing, but can you see this guy, imagine it, running around the goddam beach all suntan and he's going in swimming, like, and then somebody yells 'Hey, Ratso' -- how does that sound to you?
Am I tickled to find you, boy! Come on in and let's get a look at you. Turn around. Good strong back. You'll need it. So you want help -- take a seat, relax, tell me about yourself. Cowboy, huh?
Well, uh, I'm raring to go.
Instant V-goddam-D.
This Pensacola teeny-bopper -- jail bait -- but built? Ten bucks she wanted. Three of us made a deal for, twenty-five, see, big goddam bargain?
Where?
It's there!
What?
No, don't let her!  I'll... How about Peg? Robbie?
Where you staying, Dad?
How do you like it?  Istanbul?
About ten kilometers.
Two miles! Minefields over there. Do you know where this campground is or not?
I'll pay extra
No, I'm not afraid.
Good. There's nothing to be afraid of. If you co-operate with us, you will be on the plane for New York tomorrow... yes?
Yes.  I think so.
Well, you see Billy, it don't really matter right now if it's 2 kilos or 200 kilos. The Turks love to catch any foreigner smuggling - it shows the world they're fighting the drug trade.
New people sometimes get on his nerves.
And you?
What they give you?
That doesn't seem so bad.
He wasn't even in the car?
No... It looks like your going to have a new court.
You gotta be fucking crazy!  You got stabbed in the ass once too much, sweetheart, cause you're gonna end up in Section 13, that's what - not the 'catacombs.
What time is it?
Just got some news on Bell.
You can't take anything seriously.
Vilyum, I am Necdit Yesil.
Peter...
Weird shit...?
Fine.  You want me to call your supervisor?
Excuse me, I'm talking to you.
We'll be back at the platform in...
Oh, man, there you go again.
What's Manny doing? I can't see him anymore.
It would take a minute or so.  You won't last that long out there.
Who know?  We get lucky, maybe a couple of 'em'll be ours.
Evolution doesn't work that fast. Something pushed that thing to take the leap. We need to find another specimen.
Keep going. We'll tell you when to stop...
Honey, just leave it.
Great crowd.
Oh, no, you were-
It didn't bite me.
It's me. Can you hear me?
So, you're saying this is like those bugs that -- that look like twigs or leaves or...
It worked before...
Your arm, you can't...
Siri, sandblast that thing. It looks like Trump Tower.  Those mounds are supposed to be made of dirt and excretions...
What?
What is it?
Your legs just sing grand opera when you move, don't they?  It's not going to hurt forever, Paul, I promise you.
But what?
The swearing, Paul.  There, I said it.
I guess that means it's okay.
No. No, it isn't, it's--  --oh pooh, I can't think of any words. Would "great" be insulting?
Yes. I told you I was your number- one fan.
Well, I hope you like it.
Perfect.
Yes.
I really value your criticism, but maybe you're being a little hasty here.
That's right--when I was growing up in Bakersfield, my favorite thing in all the world was to go to the movies on Saturday afternoons for the chapter plays...
--cliff-hangers--
I've known from the very first book that Misery had to be born of nobility and I was right!
Oh, Paul, can I read each chapter when you finish? I can fill in the "n"s.  Will she be her old self, now that Ian has dug her out, or will she have amnesia...?
I've never had meatloaf this good, what do you do to it?
Oh, you. I just picked things up over the years.
Are you kidding? If anyone ever told me that one day I'd be having a candlelit dinner with Paul Sheldon in my own house, I woulda checked both legs to see which one was being pulled. Will this do?
I know you do. I love you too, Annie.  And you're right. We are meant to be together. And I know we must die. But it must be so that Misery can live. We have the power to give Misery eternal life. We must finish the book.
But the time is now. Soon others will come.
You'll know everything in a minute. Get the champagne.
Did I do good?
Not quite. I just called, and they said he checked out five days ago. Isn't that a little strange?
Nothing unusual about Mr. Sheldon's leaving, Buster--you can tell by the champagne.
No, see, he always ordered a bottle of Dom Perignon when he was ready to go. Then he'd pay up and be out the door.
I'll bet that old Mustang's pulling into New York right now.
Buster.
Answer me a couple things?
If I can.
Did they win?
Nyah!
And you're happy about that?
I would've thought the hardest part was exercising restraint.  Curbing that pressing need of your to get your gun off.  You were in such a hurry to knock off that 747, you never figured out where the virus really was.
Oh, Hunt, please! One can't hold Nyah responsible for her actions..
More like two-two point two million.
So Ambrose has Bellerophon and McCloy's got Chimera.
And the check's in the mall.
How're we doin', then?
No.  You just looked as if you did.
Think you're the only one who can pick a lock?
Would you mind if I'm on top?
Working under adverse conditions.  Highly adverse conditions.
There's nearly 2 million in London.
And six billion in the world.
No.  You can be a thief and have a conscience:  Not me.  Why did you have to tell me about this!  What do I have to do to get away from this guy?  When you're with him, he messes about with your head every waking moment..even now I'll be at some out-of- the-way-place, a tin of caviar and a bottle of Crystal shows up at the table, with two glass, God knows how he finds out at any given moment where I am in the world but he does.  And it looks like he's done it again.  You know his definition of a  true paranoid?
Have you met them?
Where do I meet you?
Easy, easy, easy, shhh!
What?  You told me to get out of here.  I thought you were here to collect me.  I was so relieved.
Then you'll have to kill me before it's too late.  Before I start killing people.
Why did you phrase it like that?
Like what?
Right now only Ambrose knows that.
In order to do that, I've got to figure out how he plans to make money with it.
Very.
You mean that leaves Miss Hall.
Yes, I gathered as much.
Yes.
I'm with an old friend now, Dmitri.
Yes, he knew.  Just..
A visit from an old friend.
'If?'  My, my, my...the five hundred people on Bruny Island that you deliberately infected with <i>Chimera</i> needed it as well.
But why tell us?
Talking's good, walking's better.
Take off your coat.
I'm going to get it for him.  Whoever the mole is, I think goes by the name of Job, at least part of the time. 1 can't find him, but if he knows 1 have the NOC list, he'll find me.
Jim was my husband. I want to know who killed him.  I want to get the son of a bitch who did this.
Claire...Hey...
Whoís dead?
<u>Are you intact</u>?
Heard a lot about you, Hunt.  Donít disappoint me.
Passport, visas - you know the drill. We'll work the exfiltration thru Canada, debrief you at Langley.  Throw the Prague police a bone, you know toss them a few suspects.  Follow me?
We've lost enough agents for one night.
I don't quite follow you.
The arms dealer.
How about if we just go quietly into the bathroom and I wash your mouth out with soap - you pathetic button down bureaucratic asshole.
Certainly Ethan.
This doesn't sound like the Luther Stickell I've heard of.  What'd they used to call you?  The Net Ranger?  Phineas Phreak?  The only man alive who actually hacked NATO Ghostcom.
I can't just hack my way inside.  There's no modem access to the mainframe, it's in a stand-alone.  I'd have to be physically at the terminal.
Now I want you to hold onto it.
I figured I'd let 'em reinstate my back pay, give me a promotion, check out my office at Langley and <i>then</i>, maybe, talk about it.
He was a good guy for a long, long time. Just - not long enough.  Gotta catch my flight.. So.  How's it feel being a solid citizen again?
Oh man...I don't know.  I'm gonna miss being disreputable.
Because I can deliver the actual NOC list.  The one you have is not only worthless, it's certain to be equipped with a homing device to pinpoint your exact location.
Okay, boot it up and in anywhere from thirty seconds to ten minutes you're gonna have Virginia farm boys hopping around you like jackrabbits.
Mm - Hmmm...
Tell you what.  How good's the RF scanner you used in the car?
Merci.
He's got it.  Saved your ass again Jack.
In position.  Jack open the door, let the package roll.
Higher.
Sarah eye on the package.  Jim, Iím coming to you.
Would you remove your hat please?
I thought I was going to see Max.
I'm willing to take the chance.
Yeah, well, Jim, fact is I've got more than ninety days leave coming.
..the next day I managed to drag myself to the safe house, must've just missed you..anyway, I checked our aliases.
You knew I liked the rentals at Liverpool Street.
A meeting tomorrow on the TGV, enroute to Paris.
Tight security.  No guns.  Real plus.
No, in your...ear piece. You have a lovely smile . Can you hear me now?
Thank you, Rose.
I don't wanna talk about it.
I don't know what you mean.
What are you doing here?
Why you looking around so much?
Yes. Do you want...
Gimme the big knife! I'm gonna cut my throat!
I'm making you a steak.
Loretta.
I was raised that a girl gets married young. I didn't get married until I was twenty-eight. I met a man. I loved him. I married him. He wanted to have a baby right away. I said no. Then he got hit by a bus. No man. No baby. No nothing! I did not know that man was a gift I could not keep. I didn't know... You tell me a story and you think you know what it means, but I see what the true story is, and you can't.  She didn't leave you! You can't see what you are. I can see everything. You are a wolf!
He made me look the wrong way and I cut off my hand. He could make you look the wrong way and you could cut off your whole head!
Me neither.
What?
Snap out of it!
What do you want to do now?
How can you ask me that?
Let me go home.
You've gotta get outta here.
What the hell are you talking about? We're engaged.
A week. Two weeks. No more.
Who is he?
We haven't spoken in five years. There was some bad blood. I want you to call him and invite him to the wedding. Will you do it?
How was your plane ride?
I don't know. But Johnny, how did your mother recover? She was dying.
I have no secrets from my family.
What! How do you know?
Well. I don't really know where to start.
Hi.
Alright. This is your penance. Say two rosaries and... be careful, Loretta. Reflect on your life.
The breath had almost totally left her body. She was as white as snow. And then she completely pulled back from death and stood up and put on her clothes and began to cook for everyone in the house. The mourners. And me. And herself! She ate a meal that would choke a pig!
Who was that?
That was my father-in-law, who has a wrong idea in his head. Listen, Johnny, there's a question I want to ask you. And I want you to tell me the truth if you can. Why do men chase women?
Well. There's the Bible story. God took a rib from Adam and made Eve. Maybe men chase women to get the rib back. When God took the rib, he left a hole there, place where there used to be something. and the women have that. Maybe a man isn't complete as a man without a woman.
No idea.
Loretta...
You're forty-two years old, Johnny, and Mama is still running your life.
What happened?
There's old saying my mother told me. Would you like to hear it?
I'm a housewife.
We could go to my apartment. You could see how the other half lives.
It's a house.
I live in a one-bedroom apartment. What exactly does your husband do?
He's a plumber.
What are you talking about, Raymond? Cosmo can't own the moon.
And you were a lamb. As soft as milk.
She's got it.
She looks like one. Yes, she does.
Halt!  Who goes there?
I am...  And this my trusty servant, Patsy. We have ridden the length and breadth of the land in search of knights who will join our court at Camelot..  I must speak with your lord and master.
Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?
Well, who is your lord?
The same!
How can we not say the word, if you don't tell us what it is?
Now stand aside worthy adversary.
A scratch?  Your arm's off.
I've had worse.
Victory is mine.  I thank thee O Lord that in thy ...
You stupid bastard.  You havn't got any arms left.
What is your name?
Now what happens?
Who are you? TALL KNIGHT We are the Knights Who Say "Ni"!
What with?
Look, you're a busy man ...
Too late.
... You silly sod.
... but a two-thirds majority ...
Shut up!
Good idea, O Lord!
If she ... weighs the same as a duck ... she's made of wood.
What is your favorite colour?
What is your quest?
To seek the Grail!
Who's that then?
Well taken, Concorde!
Er, Well ... the thing is ... I thought your son was a lady.
Herbert.
But, Father.
No ... just keep him in here.
The Castle Anthrax?
Well, look er, I ...
Sir Gawain.
No, no, this cannot be.   I am sworn to chastity!
Back to your bed!  At once!
Stop saying the word!
You tit.  I soiled my armour I was so scared!
Brave Sir Robin ran away.
Come on, man.  There's love and there's ...
Aye, she may say that to you, but the woman can say what she wants.
Aye.
I can't move to tidy.
What's your name?
Yeah.
No doubt you've heard the rumors.
My concern is for the reputation of the Monarchy.
It's the Queen's decision.
Tell her the Prince of Wales wishes to speak with her urgently about matters concerning the press.
I said, are you deaf as well as stupid?
Do you?
She'll need to sign dispatches before she retires.
I am a blank sheet.
You're injured.
The truth is, the Queen would be safer doing her duty and returning south to her public.  John Bull loves her and John Bull is her best defense.
I promised to protect her from people like you.
She'll think I betrayed her.
Ma'am.
You are well?
Then why do you persist in doing it?
Am I not safe enough with you, John?
Yes?
Not at all, Dean.  Good of you to spare the time.
The cartoon or Her Majesty's absenteeism?
Surely, you're not suggesting we dispense--
From whom?
From Princess Helena and other members of your family.
You ordered all members of the Royal Family to attend you at Balmoral.
Thanks, Albert.  Think you could print up those schematics?
We vere thinking there might be tricks. You know, surprises that you'd worked into the game...
What's the question mark?
Talk to me.
Did you play ARCADE last night?
Hmmm.  He said you were going to have dinner?
Nick...
Have you played the game yet?  It's incredible!  I was just...
Listen to me!  Greg never came home. I think the game has something to do with it.
No, wait.  Just listen.  I hooked it up earlier tonight, and it said my name.  As soon as I turned it on, Nick.  It said my name.  How could it know?  And then, I asked it where Greg was, and it said, "In here".
It is.
So how did it know my name, then?
Sorry.  Maybe I need the Valium.
It doesn't necessarily mean she's...
Maybe it is alive in a way...some sort of electronic intelligence.  It's like a computer virus that developed a personality or something.  It's self-replicating...it mimics life.
Go outside, get your car, and meet me out front with the engine running. And make it quick, okay?
What?
I don't want anything to happen to you.  I care about you.
Which way do you think Level Two is?
Okay.  It's West.
The clock's already ticking.
Shit...
What is it?
I know.
So how did you do it, Alex?
It's the wrong way!
What did he do to you?
Mom?  You're alive...
Can you say anything but "cool"?
I'm going home.
Oh, Jason thought it would be a good idea for me to meet the Cowboy. Should I wear my ten gallon hat and my six shooters?
Okay, but you don't know what you're missing.
No problem. What's on your mind?
Okay.
Wow!
She wants to know who's staying in her apartment.
His name's Wally Brown .... great guy. Been in the business since forever.
Right. See ya.
There was an accident. I came here.
I think so. I was just taking a shower.
Betty.
Hi. I'm inquiring ...well, I heard a sound last night that sounded like a car crash and I want to know if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive.
But it said #12.
Nothing. I do remember the car crash... I told you... I remember the glass ... I think about that sometimes ... I remember walking here, sort of. Now I remember this place and you. That's about it.
Mulholland Drive?
"So... surprise"...
"Before I kill you."
C'mon help me in. I'll open the front door.
Rita... I want you to stay here and you don't have to give me that money.
Yeah, what for?
Nothing... I don't like being out in the open like this.
Yeah... just .... Dr. Scott's got 'im. You remember Dr.Scott.
Well he said...  you know in his way... you know what I mean? Besides the guy gettin' rolled up under the kids car which busted him up pretty bad, there was this little knife-like torn piece of metal, you know, off the car body, rolled out and slid up through this guy's neck and just kinda slit his aorta, you know, but they didn't find it right away, so the guy's losin' a lot of blood, you know, to the brain - all this time cause it was just like this thin little puncture wound on the surface of his neck that kinda sealed itself, he said, while inside the aorta is bleedin' pretty steady all that time. So, Dr. Scott's laughin' you know like he does 'cause he knows we want to talk to this guy. He's laughin' you know and shakin'... Son of a bitch couldn't stop laughin'... It was kinda contagious 'cause pretty soon we were all laughin'...the nurse was laughin'. You know how he is.
Nope, not yet. Their fingerprints don't match up anywhere.
Where at?
So man, that's unheard of ... an accident like that ... who coulda foreseen that.
Unreal ... so, you're looking good. Whatcha doin' these days?
Doesn't it bother you to see this kind of brutal death ? I mean , I can understand the old man's infatuation with the stuff, but not you.
I'm working on it.
Then you didn't give him any passwords of any kind ?
Then he isn't embezzling either is he ?
What's the trick here ?
How long till the room fills ?
Then how come Matt and I showed up as guilty ?
What do you mean ?
How can you just take a life ? I mean it's a life, life is so precious.  How does it feel ?
What do you do with the company, if I might ask ?
This is cute.
Well, I'll see you at the next staff party.
That's very funny, sir. You are under arrest.
Okay, NOW I'm worried. What exactly is on the other side of the door ?
Either you'll be shot with bullets, impaled with a large spike, or nailed like a super model. Basically you're fucked any way you go.
Be very, very quiet...
Not down here. I'll start trusting you when I feel there the time is right. It's not personal, it's just survival.
You think I'm that easy, Bitch ?
Zach, how old are you, son ?
Zach my boy, I can spend your yearly salary in a blink. I have had that kind of money all of my life. If I wanted to, I could fly to Paris for the afternoon.  My father formed this company over seventy years ago. When my brother became mentally challenged, it was put in my charge. Now running a bank of this size is very stressful. I need to relax on what little down time I have. A yacht club will not quite make my blood pressure decline. Understand ?
Thank you, sir. I was really hoping for shares, or possibly cash... but this, this is really personal.
That was rather.... disappointing.
Yes sir. It turns out we put an innocent man into the "park" and he was not the one who stole from the stamp machine. That is also about the time when Bruce began refusing.
That mail room kid was the longest lasting "guest" yet ! Maybe we can alter the computer records and make another "guest" from the more athletic of our staff.
Sir ?
Fantastic ! A little faster sweetheart.
He has a phone pole sticking in his chest, I think we don't need an autopsy.
I've got five bucks that says someone dies here and now.
Maybe you should get over fears.
There ! There ! Did you see ! They're still alive !
So what's next ? No one's ever made it this far before.
Come on, I'm serious. Look at Wilma. She's this frail little thing, and Fred, I mean Fred Flintstone is this BIG guy. He has to be hung like a horse, and THAT's why Wilma puts up with his B.S.
Yes.
Hi. I brought some wine.
Would that impress you ? I mean you're the kinda woman that probably has Ferrari written all over your personal ad.
Are you okay ?
I am equally impressed with your knowledge of the market. How long have you been with the company now ?
No they're not. I wanna be a writer, I wanna be just like you.
This is California, anything is possible.
Don't mention it.
What about giving the other guy a break.
Look, sergeant I know I said some things last time that I shouldn't have said at all but...
Do you wanna be a hall monitor all your life?
Visualize a spare?
No it's okay, I understand, really.
Dad I'm kidding, you can have the room.
Seriously?
Hi Dad.
Totally groovy huh?
Totally.
If I eat it I'll throw up.
Well you should at least try a little bit.
She can spread her wings, right here in Pennsylvania. You don't send a child alone to Los Angeles, she could come back with her ears pierced, her legs shaved and God knows what else.
Maybe he's wet?
It's okay really, I was just a baby.
His name's Harry Sultenfuss.
I am Vada Margaret Sultenfuss. My mother was...
Umm...didn't you ever wonder about me?
It's just a corpse.
What's the matter?
He likes you.
Thanks, but I think I'm gonna stick to my mom, she led a fascinating life too.
Give it back Nicholas!
Don't wake up Vada.
And you're gonna solve the mystery?
Getting off please.
A big difference, if someone found it we should keep looking, if they didn't we're just wasting our time.
Let me see if it changes colors on me.
Maybe it'll fit my pinkie.
Come and get it.
What do you think?
Right.
And you'd be my cousin?
That thing you said about your nose...it was a stranger's nose...well it's not...it's...I mean...it's yours...you know?
Ten bucks.
What's it for?
You're a good man Nicholas.
And you certainly shouldn't settle for anything less that you deserve.
How about Nick? Did he take good care of you?
How's this for a solution. We'll take a drive over to his place, you can introduce yourself....
Well, I've come this far...the least I can do is knock on the door.
Yes, what kind of arrangement? I'd be very interested to know what kind of an arrangement we have.
So what's wrong?
Oh, are you a hairdresser?
Sort of?
Lizt was my parents' favorite, they were Hungarian.
Ahh, why don't I come in first thing in the morning and you can check out that left blinker for me.
I don't know, Dad doesn't either.
Margaret's my middle name, but everybody called her Maggie. Los Angeles, have you ever been there?
Why not now?
But Dad'll never go for it.
Let me hold him.
Do you know him?
Well, thanks for your help Mr. Rosenfeld and I'm sorry my mother wouldn't go out with you, I'm sure she would have had a really great time.
Of what??
God I guess i'll have to introduce you now.
No.
I think it's still available.
Harry?  I was just wondering, if there is anything wrong with Vada.
I don't think so, I think she's confused about death.
Oh Hi, what can I do for you?
Nothing, I was just wondering what you were doing.
I just had a terrible thought Harry.
Yeah.
Rock?
Want to what?
Shelly?
VADA!
Dad?
Goodnight Vada.
You never cared before.
Maybe I should go over and yell at him.
In the garage.
Ahh, that little Chevy was your mothers favorite car.
It's okay. Mr. Bixler, I finished all the books for summer reading.
How are you gonna get the money for this old house if you're not working?
How much does it cost?
What do you get for that?
No. Well, guess i'll go home and finish off War &amp; Peace.
I paid the money.
I wrote a poem too.
Mr. Bixler,  I love you.
Oh, Vada...
He likes her.
Who's winning?
You know Vada, you shouldn't let those girls upset you.
He's allergic to everything.
I think you'd make a fine writer, did you ask your Dad?
Big Ringo fan.
No, I'm divorced.
A girl's always gotta look her best.
Yes, Vada I think you're very pretty. You've got these great big sparkling eyes, the cutest little nose, an amazing mouth.
Uh huh, why?
I like my name.
This is Danny and Ralph, they own the Dino Raphael salon in Detroit.  We used to be married.
I won, I won!!!
I'm hemorrhaging.
Thomas J?
I knew he wouldn't come.
That was Grammoo's. It's a phrenology chart, they used to study the bumps in your head to see if you had a good personality or not. Come here, i'll diagnose your head.
No. Grammoo said she's in heaven.
Woah!!
I do, she's real funny.
You can't marry a teacher, it's against the law.
Uh huh.
But, I don't know how.
Close your eyes.
Say something it's too quiet.
Is Newsday a real interview, or just some cute guy you're setting me up w...
No, no, the opposite.  That's my best friend, Michael O'Neal. He sounds desperate to talk.
Blood oath.
He can't do that to me!
You've been working on this, huh?
This is my whole life's happiness. I have to be ruthless.
Beyond reason.  The feminist warrior will rise up in this kid, and she'll be standing over his sleeping form with a butcher knife, selecting from a short list of body parts!
All I've heard, from the day I met Michael, is Julianne this, and Julianne that...
My heart's in my throat, here. Right off, I have to ask this monstrous favor...
This is a very presumptuous and burdensome fav...
The bridesmaids are my only two female relatives under forty. Identical twin debutantes from Nashville, who are basically vengeful sluts.  With amazing bodies!
That's why Michael and I were the wrong fit.  Right from the start.
Do you get nervous in small confined spaces?
I mean, he loves his job.
Have you sized up the groomsmen, Jules?  As M. of H., you get first fuck.  Don't pick the short, hairy, rich one.
Except for the hot affairs we'll have twice a year.
It's no big deal, she just gave you the wrong keys that's s...
I had the craziest dream last night?  Walter and Kimmy had asked your boss to...
And your point?
Does that make it right...
Oh, yeah.
... your one chance for true happiness?
Course, if it's later rather than sooner, I'd hate to be you at six o'clock.  You've got a lot of explaining to...
He needs someone incredible, someone really close, who he can trust...
It would only be, maybe, six months? Or three or four? It would mean so much to him...
You lost twenty-five dollars once before that, too, near Christmas time -- I remember that real well now. December 9th, to be exact.
No.
Don't feel that way, honey.
Don't worry, I'll take care or it
Thank you-- Yes, I am.
Well, Bye, Bye now. We have to go.
Haven? Hell,' we've been playing poker together since we were fourteen.
Well, it's probably because it would help him.
Whose word?
Where'd he ever see us?
He got killed at a turkey shoot.
Your brother?
You go out in the woods and shoot targets -- Whoever shoots the most wins a live turkey
Ester and me did;  My niece picked then. She's just here from California.
Hi, Sherry.
Yes, ma'am. How are you today?
Okay... you get to sleep. I'll see you in the morning. Good night.
All they got is advertisements. Just like L.A.
What did you say?
Well I've been following him around Just listening to him --He says he can really win -- I bet he can too - -
Well, he's really amazing.
Listen, your Aunt Ester just died. I'm... sorry... Listen, I really Feel bad now about last night...We had no...
No.
Nashville.
Green?  Not Owen Green. Owen Green embezzled money from your grandfather
Listen. Maybe I should go...
When did you start singing?
Well, can you tell me why?
About three years.
I'd really like to see you.
I don't know who you are.
What?
I'm twenty-eight
Oh.
Oh.
Fifteen minutes?
Sleep. That's all I need. Don't want to waste no time sleeping. You married?
You sound different. Is that really you?
For him?
An album.
Sorry I'm late.
How long have you been together?
Oh, you meet them at parties and stuff.
When you study the martial arts, they give out belts that come in different colors to signify what level you're at in your training. Am I correct on that point?
That's what Tim said.
Mickey!
Congratulations on the Curtis Fox case, Scagnetti. You put an end to a nightmare. The ladies of this city can get to sleep again, and they have you to thank.
Or what? You'll wound me? I can blow you in half and you know it.
How come you never talk?
Ah...fine. Let me make an adjustment here, and we'll be ready to rock 'n roll. Oh...uh, the dumbass at the donut place put a chocolate cream filled I asked for in your box.
My problem Mickey, is that you don't exactly inspire empathy. I'm all alone on this. I need your help. I want what the prison board is doing to be the focus of our follow up episode. Now I have interviews with chairman of the prison board Dewight McClusky about this issue. And I'm tellin' ya, Mickey, he looks bad. The two psychologists they used for their psychiatric kangaroo court won't talk to us, which always looks bad. I have an interview with both the judge of your trial, Bert Steinsma, and the psychologist and author, Emil Reinghold, both of which discount the notion that you're insane. You put that all together, and what the state is doing becomes obvious. But the network isn't satisfied. They feel the show needs another element. It needs you. In order to put the show on the air, I need to get an interview with you. You haven't talked to the press since your trial. Now, a few days before you get transferred to an asylum, you grant an interview on television with Wayne Gayle. We're talkin' a media event here. Every son of a bitch out the with a TV set's gonna tune in to see that. We'll make their motives so blatant, we'll shame 'em into dropping the whole thing. At least for a little while, the publicity would keep them from just giving you and Mallory lobotomies. Well, whatta ya say?
So, Mickey, tell us what you do for fun.
Okay...okay...I'll buy that. We'll move on and come back later.
Well, riddle me this, Batman. How do you feel about the fact that you're never gonna see Mallory again?
Mickey, can I talk to you alone?
'Every week by forty million people. I am a respected journalist.' Have you won any awards?
Don't touch those triggers! Please. I think I've already proven that a live Wayne Gayle is much more better that a dead...Way-- Gayle. I was your passport out of jail, not Duncan Homolka. But me! I'll be your passport outta---
No fuckin' way!
Yes.
They can't because neither knows if the other is a deranged senseless killer like the Knoxs. So, you may as well make the first move.
Here's the layout of the laundry room.
I'll say enough to destroy this wing.
What's the big deal? Take out my chocolate cream filled, put one of these roasted coconut---
Okay, guys, we're here. L.A. County Jail. Julie, just park in the front.
Wayne---
Roger, enough with the fucking donuts! What did I tell you. Stop bothering Mickey, and get behind your nagra.
Yeah, we met. They're good men.
Nothing for me. I'm leavin'.
Why?
Same here. Let me introduce my crew. Scott...Roger...and Unruly Julie ...this is...I'm sorry. What's your title again?
It sure is.
No, no, no, no, no, no, I mean only two guys.
Why don't we make it three deputies and you?
Why don't I have Mickey thrown back into his cell and we can forget the whole thing?
Man, the darkest thing they got in there is Coca-Cola.
Where' you goin'?
Out.
What's the matter, Doris? Business bad?
You know, Doris - you'd make some guy a swell wife.
Okay.
What d'you think?
What did you say your name is?
Guess you must be lookin' after my boy. I'm Duff Anderson.
She got herself a husband now. They don' want him 'round. And I tell you, man, I got no use for him neither.
People seen him 'round.
Guess I don't.
No. I'm new in town.
Yes, aren't you?
I guess it's hard working on the road like that.
That's fine with me. Keeps me out of trouble.
You would, huh? If I was you, baby - I wouldn't go 'round stickin' out my jugular vein.
No, on the porch.
Look, Duff - most of the men I know - they're kind of sad. When I met you the other day I had a feeling that you're different. That's why I went out with you. I thought we might have something to say to each other.
'Been up north?
I didn't know you had one.
Surprised?
How old is your boy?
Four.
Your boy.
What d'you mean?
Don't push me, Duff.
Smells like something crawled in there and died.
You know how to box?
Huh?
How come you keep askin'?
I keep thinking about him.
Don't, Duff.
Don't ask, baby - huh!  How much money you got with you?
Water pump's busted. I don't know if it's worth fixin', but I need that car.
Just of getting hurt. They can't touch me inside.
Where're you going to go?
Okay.
How 'bout the key?
You gonna sit at home the rest of your life? Jesus!
That's right.
Good-bye, Frankie.
They all got families to support.
How about a drink?
Great.
Most folks around here got no use for nigrahs. Got to understand them, that's all. How you doin', boy?
How often does he get like that?
It's just that I hate empty rooms.
Sure.
I guess I'll make me some trouble in that town.
I'll be a monkey's kid sister! What d'you want to do a thing like that for?
Ol' Doris sure goin' to miss you.
Just give him a couple of months. A girl like that, she don't know any tricks.
Sure. Got a sixteen-year-old girl.
Is she good in the hay? No point marryin' her just to find out. Is there, baby?
If you don't quit it, Will, I'm leaving.
Got a thick feelin' here.
Better now.  Where 'you at?
Whoa.  No way.  You can't enter the kill zone.
So don't pull this cowboy shit now. You'll give him a target.  You'll get yourself killed.  Just keep talking.
I will.  Inside.  There's no other way to get the gun off the girl's head, Nate.
I've had quite enough or I wouldn't be playing such games with beautiful strangers. Aren't Peter's illusions to your liking?
Peter said you came to kill us. Is that true?
My man's coming to get my ass out of here. That's good enough for me.
A little incestuous, but at least it's original. Who's the guy in the halloween costume?
We did a pretty good job of pissing them off.
Then you'll have to persuade her to tell it to you.
Then I'd ask you what your terms are.
First sign of free will, Sense/Net usually slags 'em.
Dixie McCoy
Sorry, bullshit. We haven't even begun and you're already jeopardising this operation.
Could be your A.I.'s calling card.
Offworld. The A.I.... this "Wintermute" thing evolved on a computer mainframe on the satellite Freeside. If you attack it from within the matrix while Molly accesses its original programming we can cripple its defence systems.
That could work, but the timing will be a bitch.
Yeah, well it's working.
Good question. He may not have intended to. The girl in question is Lady 3Jane. She's very important to us. The third clone of Lady Jane Tessier.
What's inside me, Wintermute. What did your doctors do to me?
Ah, Herr Case. And how is the artiste tonight?
As far as they know, that's absolutely true.
Don't patronise me, you fuck. I was skating figure eights in this matrix while you were still peeing in your chinos.  Hey, Kid... you expecting company?
I'm surprised you still are. Should'a told me you had an A.I. running probes at you.
Yo.
It's mutating... spreading like a disease.
You can make your move when it comes after me.
It'll flatline your ass.
Take a look. Son of a bitch won't feel a thing until it's too late.
One minute eighteen and counting. What about the access code?
Wait... You hear that?
His name's Armitage. He's very anxious to meet you.
Why should I want to meet him.
Because you've exceeded your shelf life, Case. Word on the street is you're a dead man walking. Nice time for an employment opportunity. Travel to exotic locales.
I'm going in.
When I was fifteen Sense/Net iced my old man's credit record over some computer error. Once that goes down, that's it. He lost his business... everything. It destroyed him. I had to hustle arcade games for chump change. Dixie McCoy found me, figured I was a natural. He taught me the wires for a piece of the action.
You scared the shit out of me, man. You were dead for fifteen seconds. Totally flatlined.
When they did my eyes, I made them promise I'd still be able to cry. Sounds stupid, doesn't it?
My God... these people are insane.
: Because he's Guy Perkins.  Listen, you want to walk to Na- Na's and get something to eat?
Well excuse me.
Jos, that's not what we're --
Bridgework?
'Nita, this is about reporting, not accessorizing.
Transitioned?
: Wait. Do you know any gay guys?
How many times have I fired her?
Geller, we've been over this. You're a great copy editor. Maybe my best copy editor. You're not a reporter.
A flack jacket.
But I don't want it straightened out.
Have you been there?
Have you been to any parties?
Do you even know these kids?
Depend on it. No s. Your subject is plural.
What if I say no?
That's your story!
He's my teacher!
Maybe because we're not supposed to be having sex with bananas.
It's just for a couple of months.
Do you remember high school?
Jos, you've been to college, you're successful, you wash your hair now-- you're not Josie Grossie anymore.
Not the happiest of souls.  "Art is a form of catharsis, and love is a permanent flop."
Oh I don't think so.
So what are you thinking for college?
God, I would love to think I'm an interesting teacher. I mean, I had maybe one or two teachers in high school who had any passion at all.
Boys.
That's sad, isn't it? He had to sit on that wall all by himself. He deserved to have somebody.
Our penguin, right?
Do you think you'll find her?
No, I'm alone.
The person I cared about wouldn't have done this. Everything out of your mouth has been a complete lie. I don't know you at all. For all I know you could hate Dorothy Parker.
That is so sad --
Into our group.
We'd love to transition a gay guy into the group.
Hey Monty--you think we'll get any business today?
I think maybe people are scared off by the tiki torches.
Change is scary. Robbie, let me tell you a little something about the mail business. I've been in it over thirty years. And in those thirty years, the only thing that's changed is the Elvis stamp and some gun laws. People are bored! They wanna shake things up!
We followed your instructions.
<i>                                   ... Let's draw straws.</i>
<i>                      Jack said we should work together.</i>
Yes.
I know.
Coming...
When he left, he took a lot of equipment with him.
<i>                      -- It's a bat. --              Will it bend? -- It's a rat. --              Will it break? -- Perhaps it's the head that I found in the lake.</i>
I told you I want that room unpacked.
Oh, please...
Come back here!
Where's Jesse?
She's a neighbor, I drive her to school.
Elm Street?  You telling me you moved in to that big white house with the bars on the windows?
You hit that ball pretty good, Walsh.
I'm sorry...
How come?
Hi!  You didn't have to wait.
You shouldn't be fighting with that jerk.
No, that's okay.  I was just...unpacking.
I figured you might like some help.
Sorry.  Schneider id it to me again.
I feel like a jerk.
You should eat something - you'll feel better.
Why won't you talk to me?
I'm afraid to go to sleep, I'm afraid to stay awake - I'm ruining your party. They're gonna put me away for sure.
You created him - you can destroy him. He lives off your fear.  Fight him, Jesse!
Jess?
I'll get it.  Please, I don't mind.
Don't "hi Mom" me.  What are you still doing up?  It's past one!
He's full of shit.
Honey, you'll wake the whole neighborhood!
Can we talk?  Just for a minute?
Girl, what are you doing?
Watching TV.
I can see that. You watch too damn much TV.
I think new York was just what I needed.  So many people.  I never feel alone.
You pulled me in somehow, didn't you?
When I was a little girl.  Three or four. If I had a nightmare, I'd bring my Dad in. The dream would always get better.  He always used to tell me about it the next day -- he used to think they were his dreams. NANCY When did it stop?
You like gymnastics?
Now who's gonna take the word of a crazy junkie chick like you?
Puttin' in soem late hours, I see.  If you're trying for O.T., you're in the wrong place.
Don't hold back on us, Max.  We need all the help we can get.
Yeah, but here you are.  How'd I get so lucky?  I thought you were trying to forget I was alive.
You'll get to meet them all tomorrow. They're...survivors.  In a way.  All severely sleep disordered.  Insomnia, narcolepsy, bedwetting...
But nightmares are the common thread?
So I've been told.  Practically an obsession of your.
Didn't get much sleep.
Most authentic Mexican food in Springwood, which isn't saying much.  your parents still live around here?
My father an I...well, the family just seemed to fall apart.
That's right.
I can't believe I just did that.
Nancy...
What are you talking about?
I wonder if you could tell me where the...?
What do you think of the guinea fowl?
Lovely to meet you.
Wait a minute.  What about me?
That was such a great evening.
Yeh -- unfortunately, things are going to be pretty busy, but... okay, let's give it a try.  Four o'clock could be good.
Hi.
Ah no -- that's the point -- they're private villages -- only the people who live round the edges are allowed in.
It's a disease I've got -- it's a clinical thing.  I'm taking pills and having injections -- it won't last long.
I shouldn't have done that.  I shouldn't have done that.
Well, there's a question -- without an interesting answer.
I have thought about you.
Would you like me to take you through your lines?
Damn.  'And Wainwright...'
'Certainly.  And little Johnny?'
Well, get a message through to him too.
I'm sure you'd be great in Henry James. But, you know -- this writer's pretty damn good too.
It's one hell of a job.  What do you put on your passport?  Profession -- Mel Gibson's bottom.
Oh please sod off.
Wow.
Rita Hayworth used to say -- 'they go to bed with Gilda -- they wake up with me.' Do you feel that?
You can stay calm -- it's the perfect situation for you -- minimum input, maximum publicity.  Everyone you ever bump into will know.  'Well done you -- you slept with that actress -- we've seen the pictures.'
That's spectacularly unfair.
Absolutely -- you're clearly very busy.
You disappeared.
Thank you.  Shall I...
You were saying...
I hoped there might be -- but no, I'm assured there aren't.
Liar.  She hates surprises.  What are you ordering?
Well, that's the signature -- and above, it says 'Dear Rufus -- you belong in jail.'
Nice one.  Would you like my phone number?
... get fired.
No!
Good decision.  All actresses are mad as snakes.
This painting isn't the original, is it?
That's nice.
By the way -- it's you.
Well, yes -- usually -- I'd just changed to go home -- but I thought I'd just deal with this final call.
Unless it's illegal in the UK to serve liquids below room temperature: I don't want you going to jail just to satisfy my whims...
Ah... yes, enormously.
Right, right.  Ahm -- did you enjoy making the film?
I suppose so.
Excuse me -- it's your mother on the phone.
No, it doesn't.
Definitely no comment.
Buggered?
Don't give a damn about the famous girl.
No, don't think I do.
How about Miss Flintstone?
It's not yogurt -- it's mayonnaise.
There never will be, you know, unless you actually clean your clothes.
Groovy.  You should do more of this stuff.
And she's in your house.
No -- you're right.
I wouldn't go outside.
How was she?
Yes.
We've got a security camera in this bit of the shop.
But you have no proof.
Is it true McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped yesterday?
Sh-sh-she did! Everybody did!
Yes, ma'am...
How 'bout turning off that music for a while so a man can hear himself think?
I wanna report a robbery!
Oh, I had them removed.
Very well. What is it you're proposing, Mister McMurphy?
So do I!
Mr. McMurphy, you had no right to take these men out with you!
Put him in Doctor Spivey's office!
What we're gonna have to do is pull this ballclub together for our next play. 'Kay!
W-w-w-what is it, M-M-Mac?
H-Hey, M-Mack.
'K-Kay, M-Mack!
What is it, kid?
Candy? Hell no, Billy, she's just a good friend, that's all...
Ahhh, Billy...
Yeah, Mack?
They went that way.
You boys seem to think you've got a champ in there, huh?
Ya deaf! I said pass the ball!
I refuse!
McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped...
Yeah, buddy?
Yeah, it's cold!
My turn.
Jesus God...
He's not!
Yup! Worked right outta Depoe Bay for just about every season since I was able to haul my own weight.
Come on, Doc, you know as well as I do what's been comin' down in that loony bin.
Candy. Candy, over here.  Hey, Doc, time out.
It's just medication, Mister McMurphy, good for you. Now down it goes...
How do ya know that?
You think it's funny, huh?
Up an' at 'em, Taber.
Bullshit. You ain't got no way out!
Somebody's coming!
Ah believe ya, brother. Ah believe ya!
Hey, how ya doin', cutie?
Fine, thank you.  Here, please take these.
Okay, Mack!  Whoowe, Candy girl, are we in an insane asylum or ain't we?
Hi ya, big boy? How's it goin'? Like it in here?
I thought I might donate it to the mess hall.
Yes, sir, it's a mighty nice fall day...
Tha's your problem.
Bet you ass...
What kind of crap is that???
Hey, Billy, stop cryin'. You don't have to cry... You ain't got nothin' to be ashamed of. She ain't gonna tell you mother... stop crying...
Oh, there you are, Mister Turkle.
Oh, I see. He was a very sick man. Very sick.
You better believe it, you sweet little thing. You better believe it...
Yes, but...  He was having an affair.
No, she wasn't my sister.
Your mother.
You don't understand.  The man I'm supposed to marry is on that plane.
Nobody here has any idea which way he went?
So, what's the story with your friend?
No...
Congratulations.
Thanks.
Amazing.
This is his fiancee.  Who's this?
Damon Bradley...
How could you do this to me?
Are you okay?  You want some help?
So?!  Is there something wrong with loving somebody who's safe?
So?
Uh, I'd rather not say.
He's out by the pool right now.
Do you want me to do it?
I just wanted to keep an eye on you.  The guy's a total stranger, remember?
I know the feeling.
Well.  Congratulations.
Thank you.  So, since I have a few more days of vacation left, I was wondering if maybe you'd want to do something sometime.  I mean, you know, if you don't have... other plans.
And I can't believe you are so stubborn and so blind as to let some stranger, some phantom you've never even met destroy it.
That's not the point.  And what if I had wanted to?
Aren't you going to tell me who you are?
Really?
Well, to-- new friends.
Hmmmm... Well, the scampi sounds good...
So, what are we waiting for?
I don't know, Kate.
You don't have any idea?
Come on, it's not so bad.
Look how big it makes me look.  I look like an Alp.
I know.  You're right.
Have you seen him with someone?
So?
Well, you don't have to get snippy with me.
Anna, I'm Faith.  You don't know how happy I am to meet you.  You see, I'm trying to find someone, and--
All of the sudden, I'm feeling kind of nervous.  God, I hate blind dates.  Why couldn't we just have arranged marriages in America?
Peter found him?
Joan Collins stayed here.
Kate.  Thank God you're there. I need help.
Maybe if I kiss him I'll feel it.
So...
No.  Well, I don't know.  Well, maybe.  Later.
Damon Bradley?  That's why you're here?
She said she knew where to find him, and then she grabbed my car keys, and--
I have to talk to her.
I make it twentysix twenty-three. You're fifty short, Skins.
So do I, Charley. For your sake.
Then don't.
Come on, kid. I'll buy you a drink.
Working hard?
But going in that church, I'd be stooling for you, Charley. You make a pigeon out of me.
I've got to cover a bet there on the way over. Anyway, it gives us a chance to talk.
You don't mean you're thinking of testifying against— 
Wow... .
What happened?  What happened?
Oh, I thought you was gonna go to work— with all them muscles. 
I'm with Terry.
Everybody knew him. He got around.
Aah, he's a bottlebaby, he talks to himself, the joke of the neighborhood.
You training to be a nun or something?
Maybe they just didn't know how to handle you.
Do you like pigeons?
I'd better go in.
In a saloon?
No thanks... .
Were you really a prize fighter?
I had to scrap all my life. Figured I might as well get paid for it. When I was a kid my old man got killed—never mind how. Charley and I was put in a place—they called it a Children's Home. Some home! I run away and peddled papers, fought in club smokers and—  But what am I runnin' off at the mouth for? What do you care?
Terry!
What do they do for you, except get in your way?
Yeah, yeah... .  This Father Barry, what's his racket?
You've been off in daisyland, honey. Everybody's got a racket.
You don't believe in anything, do you?
I won't eat cheese for no cops, that's for sure.
I'm tryin' to keep you from being hurt— What more do you want?
Edie!
I don't rate it.
Pigeons... .
How can you be with Charley and Johnny Friendly and still be with me? Either way it's a lie. It's like there were two different people inside of you. You've got to be one or the other.
I don't want to hurt Charley— I don't want to hurt you...
I never mentioned the word before. In his agony he grips a glass standing on the night table.
I didn't say I didn't love you. I said stay away from me.
You're all packed.  And here's your bus ticket. You're on your way back to St. Anne's.
Who is he, Pop?
Who is he! Edie, you're so softhearted and soft-headed you wouldn't recognize the devil if he had you by the throat. You know who this Terry Malloy is? The kid brother of Charlie the Gent, Johnny Friendly's right hand, a butcher in a camel hair coat.
I don't want to hear it in there.
—It started as a favor— for my brother— you know they'd ask me things and it's hard to say no— a favor— Who am I kiddin'? They call it a favor but it's do it or else. And this time the favor turned out to be helping them knock off Joey. I just thought they'd lean on him a little but— Last night with Edie I wanted to tell her only it— stuck in my throat. I guess I was scared of drivin' her away— and I love her, Father. She's the first thing I ever loved.
What do you want from me, Father.
You go to hell.
Those blood suckers. How I'd love to fix those babies but—
O.K. O.K. Without the bird seed. What do you want?
If I licked him I would have had the title shot instead of him— boy, I was ready that night.
Listen, this ain't for publication.
Yeah. My own blood— and they sell me out for a lousy bet— I had it in me to hit the top and—  Boy, if I wanted to, the things I could tell you about them guys— 
Well, I better get going. Hit those stairs again.  Was that a looping right or an uppercut the first time you caught him?
Yeah, I'm kidding, I'm kidding. You don't think I should turn him in... .
Hit me again.
So-so, Johnny.
Aw, you know I don't like to count, Johnny.
You come from Green Point? Go back to Green Point. You don't work here no more.  Here, kid, here's half a bill. Go get your load on.
Nothing happened, he says. Some operator you got yourself there, Charley. One more like him and we'll all be wearing striped pajamas.
You mean Kayo Nolan, the old timer? He doesn't know much.
I can't believe it— a small fortune.   You can't buy me— you're still a bum!  'Bye, Edie. Lord have mercy on Joey. 
Leave her alone, you fiend!
But does it have to be in a cemetery?
You wouldn't understand.  Seeing a cemetery on a night like this can stir in the mind the best ideas for a good horror story.
But there're so many wonderful things to write about, Bob.
All right.  Don't worry, I'll be right beside you.
I can't imagine anything dead playing that music.
Those creatures..!
My old boyfriend Tommy would never have gotten me in a mess like this.  At least <i>he's</i> got brains.
I love you Bob. I really do. Forgive me?
Oh, yes, a religion of sorts.
I would have time for my own pleasures!
The <b>moon</b> is almost <b>gone!</b>
Hahh, there is always time... All in good time...there is <b>always</b> time.  You shall have your pleasure.  <b>THAT</b>... I <i>decree</i>
The time...is short.
Yes, Master.
You know better than that.
We don't know of anything, Master...
I have promised both The Wolf Man and The Mummy a reward.  It could be that <b>you</b> are that reward.
Aannnnaahhnn.
That's funny, Adele.  How many more times you gonna gimme that one?
Listen, Adele, the reason I called, that party is today instead of Sunday. About eight-thirty, like only a few hours from now.  So you'll have to get hold of Buddy, whatever he might be doing...
I want to speak with you, please.
You do the sawing of the box in half trick with you inside?
I'll say one thing for Jack, he was never ugly or mean, or drank too much. He was very considerate, lights on or off, if you know what I mean.
Jack came out of a bank he just robbed in Pasadena, couldn't get his stolen car to start.  Battery was dead.  He looks over, sees Buddy sitting in a burgundy Bonneville, goes up, offers him a thousand dollars for a jump. Turns out, Buddy was casing the same bank and saw the whole thing.  Buddy says, I'll take the thousand, but we're leaving in my car, not that piece of shit you come in.  They musta robbed fifty banks together.
I know exactly what you mean.  It's just a feeling.  You know, I could go for some wine tonight.
Yeah, but what happened after she drove off with Glenn?
I been thinkin', if I was Glenn, I was up there to take down the Ripper, where would I go?
Is that Snoopy?  In the purple doo rag?
Just hung up.
Now that's a really big house.
No doubt the man's got some big-ass security system.
Let fate decide?  What're you, the fuckin' Dali Lama now?
My sister believes in fate, but not hell.  That's why she stopped praying for the lost souls since you don't hear that much about purgatory anymore. But every day she asks her boss to pray I don't fuck up.  Whatta you think, you think there's a hell, Jack?
It wasn't about getting laid.  I just wanted to know what might've happened if things were different.
You find out?
I'll make you a deal.  Get out of here. Right now.  I'll do the job with the Snoop, meet you wherever you want and give you half.
You remember Buddy, don't you, Richard?
In the trunk, yeah?
When I was seeing Carl Tillman, I didn't know he robbed banks.
And what happened to Carl?
Is that what you would've done?
We'll talk another time, Karen.  All right?  I'd like to know why Foley put you in that second car when he didn't need you any more.
I'm at Adele Delisi's.
What-- we already talked to her.  That's a dead end.
You're gonna use a ram?
Leave it where it is.
I could walk out of here.
I told you, man, Super Bowl Sunday.
Who?
Detroit, you must be pretty busy.
Who was the friend?
There a problem, Foley?
How much for your company at chow?
Snoopy Miller, famous fight thrower.
Look, Snoop, I don't know what Glenn promised you or what you think you're gonna get, but the deal is me and Buddy get half of whatever we take from Ripley, understand?  How you and Glenn cut up the rest is up to you.
Let's go outside and talk.
Soon as we leave here.  Stop home and pick up what we need and go do it.
That what they're wearing these days to break and enter?
Jack, you don't use a gun, do you?
For your breath.  You could use it. Squirt some in your mouth.
Jesus, you sound like my ex-wife.
You're full of interesting facts, aren't you?
<i>Network</i>.  Yeah, she was good.
Peter Finch.
You're sure easy to talk to.  I wonder -- say we met under different circumstances and got to talking, say you were in a bar and I came up to you -- I wonder what would happen.
With Robert Redford, when he was young.
Get your hands up and turn around. <u>Now</u>.
Who was it answered the phone?
You won't do that.
Why not?
I'm a sales rep.  I came here to call on a customer and they gave me a hard time because I'm a girl.
Is that how you think of yourself?
I like your hair.  And that suit.
I had one just like it -- well, it was the same idea, but I had to get rid of it.
It smelled.
It's not a game.  Something you play.
I don't know.  I hadn't worked that part out yet.  All I knew was that I liked you, and I didn't want to leave you there, never see you again.
To warn her about Chino.
You coming back?
What about <i>my</i> motive?  Now I can say I fucked a US Marshal.  You think I will?
You just did, for Christ sake.
Some people are going out of here. What if I told you where and when?
Okay.  How many going out?
Looks like tonight.
I don't know.  I never used a gun.
Of course not.
You goin' right back to work?
Gentlemen.  I think we've calmed down now.  Haven't we, Jack?
Maurice Miller, couple of his friends.
For a time.
You don't remember me, do you?
Do we have a gun in the car?
The two guys you were with -- that one, that isn't Maurice Miller, is it? I've seen Snoopy's mug shot and that didn't look like him.
Ripley?  You mean the wall street guy?
And is Foley a part of this?
Gee, I wonder why not.
Really?
It's a guy you know.
You there?
I don't have to prove shit to you. The Ripley job is <i>my</i> job.  You're either in or you're not.  You wanna pop some crack dealer pissed you off, that's your problem, not mine.
Why'd he have to do that to that girl?
How's it going?
You know your divisions.  You like the fights?  Like the rough stuff?  Yeah, I bet you do.  Like to get down and tussle a little bit?  Like me and Tuffy, before she got run over, we use to get down on the floor and tussle.  I say to her, "You a good dog, Tuffy, here's a treat for you."  And I give Tuffy what every dog love best.  You know what that is? A bone.  I can give you a bone, too, girl.
You fit another Chanel suit in here?
It's a --
Can't.  I gotta drive out to Glades, then I'm meeting Ray Nicolet at ten.
Hello?  Yeah, she is.  Just a minute.  For you.
You like the wild ones, don't you? Tillman, Nicolet and now Foley.  You know, I've always said there's a thin line between the cowboy cops and the armed robbers, all those guys that love to pack.
So what I want to know is why Buddy still calls his sister every week even after she turned him in.
Out for the evening?
He's in Florida.  Palm Beach.
Foley's got it.
Are you sure they're here?
Red...Strange?
You're Walker, right?
Hale-what?
Where's that lizard?
Auxiliary field at Haleiwa, ten miles north of here.
Land of the free.
Sorry you're gonna die -- cause I'm gonna make it.
We'll get separated over the target, but you and I will rendezvous for the run to China.  I'm on your wing.
Lieutenant... I'm Danny Walker.  I'm Rafe McCawley's best friend.
I taught him to drink beer.  He taught me how to fly.
How's everything?
Sorry.
Colonel, to f-fight you need strategy. To have strategy, ya gotta practice.  And to practice it, ya gotta play --
Good luck over there McCawley.  I admire your decision.
How often you fight like this?
Every other Sunday.  I'm heavyweight champion of the West Virginia.
Thank you, 'Mam.
You take care, Dorie.
No, he...got some news today.  He'll be okay, he just didn't feel like coming tonight.
We're all going away.
What else can we do?
I need to tell you something.  I didn't know what it was to lose somebody, to see death and find how much it scares you. That you haven't lived and loved enough. I didn't understand.  Forgive me.
They were bringing back a ship full of wounded and needed extra nurses along.  I wrote Colonel Doolittle, and told him I needed to see you before you go.
It must of been a convincing letter.
Uncharged torpedoes have different balance.
If we achieve surprise, they will offer little resistance.
Well which of those three ya want fixed?
Fook ya!
You have something to say, Yamamoto?
What's Peggy Sue going to do at your lodge meeting?
Grandpa, if you had a chance to do it all again, what would you do?
Do you have to wear that hat?
How do you like my hair?
Hey, you're a hip chick. You look like you stepped right out of Life magazine. Any time you want to borrow it again, just ask.
I feel ridiculous. Maybe I should go home and change.
You're kidding...? Carol, you have beautiful hair.
Lucky lady. Hi.
And we're here on the couch...
Charlie! Am I dead?
How could you forget? We talk about seeing other people and you forget?
Looking good out there.
You're pretty charming when you want to be.
I'm sorry Charlie.
I just can't trust you anymore.
That's just it. You can always get to me. There's this window in my heart and every time I leave it open, you climb in. Unless I close it now, nothing's ever going to be different!
How'd you know about that?
Just take a look at it. 
I love you.
I've got to go now.
Hello, Charlie.
We think this party might cheer her up. Just make sure you know what's expected of you.
Sorry. These fountain pens are so tricky.
Hey Terry, what is that?  Did Peggy make it up?  I've never seen that on Bandstand.
Right now you're just browsing through time. Choose the things you'll be proud of. The things that Last.
It was Beth's idea.
I was impressed with what you said in English class today.
This is great reefer.
A ray of oneness piercing the solitude. Falling bodies in the ecstasy of flesh. You'll be a chapter in my memoirs of desire.
I'd love to.
You think so?
Ssh. He's great.
Peggy, let me ask you something.  You're not... expecting are you?
I think they're going to deregulate it.
Listen Dad, please. Buy IBM, buy Polaroid, buy Apple Computer. No, no. Not yet. Buy Xerox!
But when John F. Kennedy's elected President, men'1l stop wearing hats.
What's the matter? Did you two have a fight?.
Would you get that, dear?
That's a good girl... I hate to see you so upset.  Tell me, sweetheart. Are you having problems with Charlie? You mentioned something this morning.
What are you doing?
Look at Kenny Rossi. Isn't he dreamy? I wish he'd break up with Arlene. She thinks she's so great.
You think this'll cheer Dad up?
You look exactly the same.
He's not here. We're getting divorced.
The only time people like Dolores used to pay any attention to me was to laugh at me or insult me. That guy, Doug Snell, who shook my hand when we walked in, he used to call me a four—eyed worm.
I guess part of us never really leaves high school.
Congratulations on the math contest, Richard.
I'm not doing any tutoring this year. I'm too busy.
You have a blind grandfather. One day you're going to invent a machine that reads books for blind people. I read about it. You're going to be famous. You're going to invent a lot of things.
Come on, Richard, I'm serious.
Give me some credit, will you?
Richard! They don't have any! They never heard of them! Isn't that wonderful?
Jogging. I was running, now I'm jogging.
Look, I'm desperate. I'll try anything. But what if you can't snap me out of it?
Silicon is from sand.
Hey! Do you have any idea how much those beakers cost? I usually charge for hypnosis.
When I was young I thought cats were the girls and dogs were the boys.
I was building a doggy door.
What do they do up there?
What's wrong?!
You nervous? New town, new school. I know it must be pretty hard for you...
Your Mom and I loved each other, Geoff. Don't ever think that we didn't.
Geoff, this is crazy. Zowie didn't die.
Your momma's worried sick over you. You take off in the middle of the night, you don't show up for school. What're you trying to prove?
Mom...
I don't know what to do, Bob.
What's wrong with my face? You want to know what's wrong with my face? I've got a skin condition. Next question, Bob? No more questions? Fine. Now can you help me find the complaint?
Thanks, Walter.
You're going to the office?!
I'm not going to die.
You want me to give up? Let this thing turn us into <u>victims</u>?
Mr. Beckett, I'm sorry...
Defined by Webster's as harmless.
The law says people with disabilities cannot be terminated, so long as they can perform the duties required by their position...
Beckett? I'm sorry about... what's happened to you. It's a fucking kick in the head.
There is no relevant precedent.
Then we establish how Wheeler's boys recruited you after law school...
We proceed, representing your estate.
Opera?
Want to hear my favorite aria?
Yes. On my torso.
I'm late, I have to pick up Amy from her afterschool but I want to talk to you about that Hansen thing.
Something like that.
I guess it was 1984, 85.
Miguel has not been infected. As I said, we weren't aware of AIDS, then, or how it is spread.
And it's your contention, that when the partners were made aware of the lesions, they jumped to the conclusion you had AIDS and fired you.
Well... One time, Mr. Wheeler's secretary, Lydia, told me Mr. Wheeler had a problem with my earrings.
What did you say?
You had contact with someone who has AIDS, and you're worried.
Uh.... No. Not really.
Okay, Mr. Laird. Explain this to me like I'm a four year old: Did Andrew Beckett win your lawsuit for you or not?
Did that thrill, impress and overwhelm you?
And I hate to rush you out of here, but...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... do you think... ? You think <u>I'm</u>...  ... gay?
Two men making love... ? Now tell me again... <u>why</u> is that disgusting?
Yes, we did.
Attorney for the plaintiff?
This would be a good time to break for the day...
Wait a minute. The man was fired for incompetence, not because he has AIDS. You didn't know he was sick, did you, Bob?
... to suit their personal desires, and the rest of us have to live with it.
Jesus.
What about other homosexual facilities, whatever they are?
Bob. You're trying my patience. Andrew Beckett is making his private life our business. We gave him Kronos. Did he say, "I'm sick. I might not be able to see this through?"
... keep them from that area, on grounds of relevancy.  What, Bob?
Don't wanna miss this.
Gonna lose everybody out here....
Audrey? Oh, Audrey....
You mean...tonight? With all those things still out there?
Liquid oxygen canisters inside. Start ripping them out. Quick hits only -- try to make it last.
Tell me about the sounds. You told them you heard something right before....  If you don't talk to me, Johns'll take another crack at it -- at your skull.
I got the quick-and-ugly version.
An' now you're worried about a repeat of history?
One or two.
So where the hell's God now, huh?  I'll tell you where! He's up there PISSING ON ME!
Confusin' me with Johns now -- fear was <u>his</u> monkey. I only deal in life and death. All that stuff in between? Some shade of grey my eyes don't see.
Just a suggestion, but perhaps we should flee.
What, switch what?
Amazing. I'm Johns.
Better keep moving....
What, you think I'm doin' this to prove something?
How many?
Let's board this up and get the hell gone. They seem to stick to the dark, so if we stick to daylight, should be all --
You mean, if he learns that you're gonna royally fuck him over.
And here you got two mornings every day. Wow, were you <u>born</u> lucky?
Look, we gotta think about everyone now -- the kid especially. How scared is she gonna be out there?
Oh, don't use her like that, for a smoke screen.
How much?
We're just burnin' light here.
So what the bloody hell happened, anyways?
I mean, I mean, chrono shows we're 22 weeks out, so gravity wasn't supposed to kick in for another 19. I mean, I mean, I mean, why did I fall <u>at all</u>?
You know who Muhammad was?
Frightening thought.
Where's Mr. Johns?
New Mecca....
Said "looks clear."
What're you jaw-jackin' about? Girl's not cut.
Not if I'm the one.
Look, it's hellified stuff -- but no different than those battlefield doctors when they have to decide who lives and who dies. It's called "triage," okay?
Kept calling it "murder" when I did it.
Take it.
Cornelius, if you have a moment today, I'd like to discuss this expedition of yours in more detail.
Dr. Zaius --
How did you know we'd come here?
Indeed, the very fact that these tools are unknown to us could suggest a culture in certain ways almost equal to our own. Some of the evidence is uncontestable ...
I apologize.
Your conclusion is premature. Have you forgotten your Scripture? The Thirteenth Scroll?  'And Proteus brought the upright beast into the garden, and chained him to a tree, and the children made sport of him.'
Seal the cave?
But what about your theory? The existence of someone like Taylor might prove it.
Cornelius has developed a brilliant hypothesis -
Nothing will grow here .... there's just a trace of hydrocarbons, and most of the nitrogen is locked into nitrates.
That way.
Any particular reason?
Taylor -- quit riding him.
Hmph.
Good morning, Julius. How's our patient today?
Awww, it still hurts, doesn't it?
Huh?
He's trying to form words.
Sorry...  I was thinking of Stewart. What d'you suppose happened?
Okay. You read me well enough. Why can't I read you?
But I'm not prepared to die.
Scarecrows?
No cigar.
Shouldn't we be moving on?
Sorry, Lucius. You'll have to stay here and guard the horses.
Always giving orders. Just like every other adult.
Lucius.
Yes, Sir. But this -- creature is a special case.
You destroyed his memory! His mind! His identity! And, you want to do the same to me!
Well...do you acknowledge kinship with any of these creatures?
With one of them.
What about it?
When were the Sacred Scrolls written?
Tell him to pull back!
Which one?
He doesn't know.
But there's the doll, sir.
...You keep pouring out that suppressing fire, Barnes. I don't wanna be caught out there with my ass hanging out you hear me?
Uh... Bob. Like to speak to you. Take a minute.
Bob, I gotta bad feeling about this, I... I'm telling you I got a bad feeling, man, I don't think I'm gonna make it... y'know what I mean?
Hey Taylor, you don't know it but I saved your ass today. I killed a shit-eating dog. 
You gonna wipe your ass dis time?
Don you worry Bunny, youse a killer anyway.
Yeah.
But what'd she actually do?
Barnes got it in for you, don't he?
You okay man? Neck botherin' you?
They don't know shit Barnes, and chances are we gonna run into something.
Excuses are like assholes, Taylor - everybody got one.
The Good Lord works his revenge in strange ways.
Squad? I didn't know we was still referring to this platoon in terms of squads sir. 
Same as an hour ago. Remember? I'm the steady type.
A very small service. It doesn't even ask for thanks. How long for?
Indefinitely?
I don't know.
Thank you.
Would you mind?
Your liquor laws..
It might be worth a Martini to you.
You're drinking it.
There isn't one.. That anyone would believe. I went for a walk after dinner, down to the ocean...alone... I came up and went to bed. I didn't sleep very well. Then there was a thunderstorm. And it began to rain. I went across to close the French door. That's the first time I saw him out there.
There wasn't any plane.
So there is. You don't want to go to bed. I don't want to go to bed. Let's go somewhere and hear some music--have something to drink-- something to eat--even dance.
Is this the best you can do?
All right--following me.
Nothing matters.
Take me where I haven't the courage to take myself.
I run over to Victoria.  Play some golf with some people I know.  Do it all the time.  That's why I have a cabin cruiser.  Custom- built.Forty knots.  Mr Clark Brandon an almost gentleman of almost complete leisure.  Member of six golf clubs.  Broke 70 once on the Shaughnessy Heights Course.  You have to be good to do that, And if you look out of a front window of the Empress Hotel in Victoria, in a few hours you can look right down on Mr. Brandon's boat, the Valkyrie.  Came alone?  Sure.  He always comes alone.  Mr Brandon's a rather lonely man.
Do you have to leave the note?
Funny, I never thought of you that way.  You were so close too.  We were all pretty stupid about you.
If it was an accident, you could have told the truth.
He'll come back...They always come back when you give them money.
I guess I'm a little screwy.  Maybe I could believe it.  Should I try?
Mitchell was dead enough.
Magruder does.
Me?
I think you mean that.
Yes, Miss.
I was born in New York City. I grew up. And here I am.
I'm sorry, that's all there is.
That's an evasion and you know it.
Care for a stroll outside? Beautiful morning. The air is like wine, the sky is a deep blue.
Down below's Stanley Park. On the other side of the trees, there's a beach. You can see it.  Steveston's over there. Coast Guard station.  There's the Yacht Club, and beyond it, the docks. The over on the other side of the inlet, there's Grouse Mountain. It's about 4000 feet high. There's a restaurant on top of it. Very nice restaurant.  I'm sorry we couldn't have met in pleasanter circumstances, Miss Mayfield.
Who hasn't--one way or another?
You understand perfectly.
I'm about to be very silly.  A man passes a girl on the street--a very lovely girl--his eyes meet her eyes, and something reaches out and takes hold of his heart-- and then she goes on and is lost in the crowd--and he says to himself, "There goes my lost love"-- and it's true--if he never sees her again, it's still true.  Of course, after a while, he forgets-- or almost forgets--because after a while we forget almost everything.  But this man is a copper.  He gets orders--routine orders--to go to a place and investigate a murder-- and everything points to a certain girl.
He looks at the girl, looks into her eyes--
Jeff.  Shall we go now, Jeff, and get it over with?
That's something I can't spare you.  But I won't do it myself.
You've got a couple of hours, maybe.
There's an empty taxi across the street.  If you're so anxious, take it.  He'll know the way to the police headquarters.
Sometimes.
Mr. Reed, please, for Mr.  Brandon.  Very well. Have him call. Mr. Brandon is in his office now.  Mr. Reed stepped out, Mr.  Brandon.
Private eye?
What have you got on Miss Mayfield?
Leave that one lay.
Who told you my name?
I would.  Fancy waking up every morning with that in your lap.  Wonderful thing, money is.  Remember what Somerset Maugham said about it ?
"Money is a sort of sixth sense that gives meaning to all the others." Very appealing, especially to a poor man.
You do a lot of real estate trading, Brandon?
Good afternoon, Mr. Campbell.
Passkey?
I'm a very observant man. You had something in your bag this afternoon, Something that causes you to hold it in a particular way. Something that made a particular sound when you put it down on the bar. You went out with Mitchell. None of us ever saw him again.
That's not enough.
How clumsy. I'd never forgive myself. Good night my dear.
You could have got in that room, just as you got in here. How do I know you didn't kill Larry?
I needn't keep you any longer, Mr. Clarendon.
If you'd seen the blood on his head--and some body had to carry him out to sea--
What's the face for, Driscoll?
I'll know when I find it.
So?
No suicide.
Did we ever really think it was suicide?
I was in love with him... which shows you the quality of my brains.  Why don't you ask her about the gun?
Remember that time, didn't I? Good morning Mrs. West.  Does your visit here mean you've changed your mind?
Mortar shells are not funny, either.
It does.  May I go now? 
I don't understand.
You'll have to take my word for it.  We don't make slides until we have perfect prints for comparison.
"Superintendent J. Mckechnie, Vancouver Police Department. Vancouver B.c. Replaying To Your E.P. teletype classification No. 2684 incomplete.  We advise identification possible.  Elizabeth Kinsolving, arrested Greenwater, North Carolina, January 8, 1948, on a charge of murder.  Signed, FBI., Washington, D.C. H. Cleary, Inspector in charge."  Have ye any comment, Killaine?
There are people in this world who don't think a police badge is a badge of honor.  I'm not one of them.
So-so.
I've always been a heel. I guess I always will be.
How about your new friend?
Right.
He's a little unhappy.  I hope he wasn't a nuisance?
I see.  Are you a socialist, Mr. Penfield?
Yes.
So I can go ahead and be a historian without feeling like a poseur.I shall be fulfilling a citizen's duty.
If you like.  But don't be too modest, James.  The citizen's duty is to remember, not necessarily to write books.  You are highly qualified.  You're a responsible journalist doing what sounds to me like a very demanding job.  Every day you take decisions that depend on your sense of history.  A genuine tyranny would have to get rid of people like you.
She'll be here next weekend.  Why don't you come too, James?  I'll                       * show you the marshes properly.  If you're lucky you might even see the first of the geese arriving from Siberia.
Didn't Evelyn Waugh say that the country under Atlee seemed to be under enemy occupation?
Working hard on that book I was telling you about.  Coming to the meeting?
No.  I'd want to--
You know the lingo.  Jolly good. So your language will have to be simple, not stupid, mind, but simple, very, very simple, and always remember it's an American readership.
So it's all worked out perfectly...
Good theory.  But I like my mother. I have no aversions to what she does.
No, there's a fourth.  Numbness. You do everything right, but you feel nothing either way.
Who?
C'mon.  I don't want any Jones about this.
To the Fleet.
To the Fleet.
Get way.  You'll see when I'm ready. First I want you to reflect on my noble behaviour, on how your interests are closest to my heart, how I lay awake at night worrying--
...an innocent interest, and found out that last year Vogue ran a series called 'Mothers and Daughters' Number seven, Anne and Susan Barrington.  Being a decent loving friend I went to the files and made a copy for you.
According to this, the daughter goes up to stay quiet often.  You'll need to get yourself invited for the right weekend.
Susan and I are very old friends, James.
You're a piece of shit
What period?
It goes from Henry VIII.  Henry VIII, Edward IV, Mary, Elizabeth I, James I, Charles I, Charles II, James II, William and Mary, Ann, George I, II, III and IV, Victoria, Edward VII, George V, Edward VIII, George IV, Elizabeth II.
I've got to be going.  I've got a meeting tonight.
No.
Ploughman's Lunch.  Traditional English fare.
What have you got there?
We'll see what we can do.
It's because he desires you.  The women get all the breaks at these conferences.
So what's the biggest?  Waimea?
How you figure?
Sure, it's a blast, but listen, I sorta screwed up my knee yesterday--
Don't screw around man, pull it!
One thousand feet.  Pull the goddamn cord!
You gotta tell me where she is.
No games, Bodhi.  Pull the cord! Now!!
You sure he isn't out back?  You mind if I go take a look?
Look, I don't know anything about your dog, okay--
All the food groups?  Avoiding sugar?  Caffeine?  I see to it that my people maintain cardiovascular fitness.  We stay off hard liquor, cigarettes...
Punk.  Quarterback Punk.
Smart.  You burn time in the vault.
So you're gonna coast to retirement, when you could nail these guys and go out with come dignity.
Candle wax.  Car wax.  Mustache wax? Could be anything.  Guy's waxing his mustache at the beach.  Gets sand in it.  Wipes it off with a shoe.  Shoe scuffs the counter.
Surfers use it on their boards. They rub sand into it for traction.
Aw shit.
Did he rob it?
Yeah, or cashing a check.
This gonna take long?
People are expendable to Bodhi.
Betadyne doesn't hurt.
You've been pushing too many Pencils, Dillon. Had enough?
You don't know how much I missed this, Dutch!!! Once you get this in your blood, you never get it out!!!
It was all bullshit. All of it. From the start... you set us up, got us in here to do your dirty work.
Guess I've picked up some bad habits from you, Dutch. Now don't argue with me, you know I'm right. Get to that chopper and hold it for us. We'll be along.
... Right, I got a score to settle for the Bro...
You saw what?
What have you got in mind, General.
Mr. Harris, we know you've purchased at least twenty percent of our stock.  We also know you plan to file a formal bid for a majority share.
We're on the verge of closing a large navy contract.  Double is ridiculous but we can assure you a healthy profit on your shares.  We would give you a promissory note...
I like your hat.
Storage, I think.
You've got a lot of nerve.
Of course, yes.  After the <u>expected</u> filing period is over, I'm going to recommend to the board that we accept your bid.
You looking' for some company?
Nice car.  Yours?
What's your name?
Edward.  My name is Edward.
Why?
Every place has hookers, but if this hotel has hookers, they don't look like they're...
I think he wanted you to tip him.
Where are they?  Shopping together?
You really are a very beautiful girl.
Did you sleep well?
No, I don't "got it".  Even the farmboys back in Georgia come to the door when they're taking you on a date.
Hello?
Was someone rude to you?
You still mad at'm?
I'm sure that's true for some of them.
Clean the slut up, take her out, huh?!  What are you trying to prove!?  I'm not a piece of meat for you to offer to your friends!
I don't know what you're talking about.
I'll whisper some of the main parts of the story to you.  But you'll be surprised how much you understand.  The music conveys the story more powerfully than any words.
If you'd gone on about how much you liked it, I'm not sure I'd have believed you.
Bill, we're businessmen, not the damn mafia.  I'll see you in the office.  By the way, about your car...
I'm here.
You're being ridiculous.
You spent it on drugs, didn't you?
No, let's go to work.  Okay?
That crack is burning a hole in your pocket.  There isn't even milk in the fridge.  The rent's due.  Now come on --
'Lo.
I'm getting dressed now.  I'll be over.  Bye.
So whatta' you going to do in San Francisco?
Yeah, what?
Is that all?  You just fold back the bedspread?
I'm just going to my room.
I didn't want to get it messed. I got shoes too.  Wanna see?
Yeah, mine too.  Is it like, y'know, normal?
Miss Vivian... there's a salon here in the hotel.  Instead of worrying unnecessarily about table manners, why don't you just have your hair done instead?
If we surrender, and I return with you, will you promise not to hurt this man?
I killed him myself.
With pride. What can I do for you?
Of course you will.
Well ... you were dead.
I believe you -- So what happens now?
Frankly, I think the odds are slightly in your favor at hand fighting.
Why is that, do you think?
-- I do not accept excuses.  I'm just going to have to find myself a new giant, that's all.
It's you.
Perhaps not. I feel fine.
Have you any money?
What's the difference?  We've got him. Help me here. We'll have to force feed him.
Where did you get that?
The Eel doesn't get her. I'm explaining to you because you looked nervous.
Do you want me to go on with this?
I don't understand.
What? What?
Now I think you ought to go to sleep.
Okay.
Rise and report.
You mean you wish to surrender to me? Very well, I accept.
I tell you once again -- surrender!
No.  To the pain.
She's been like that ever since the Fire Swamp.  It's my father's failing health that's upsetting her.
Now, where is that secret knot? It's impossible to find.  Are you coming down into the Pit? Westley's got his strength back. I am starting him on The Machine tonight.
Who are you? -- Are we enemies? Why am I on this wall? -- Where's Buttercup? --
-- anything you want --
Hah?
We're really in a terrible rush.
I need him to help avenge my father, murdered these twenty years.
He's dead. He can't talk.
Humiliations galore!
You don't know any way you'll trust me?
I was eleven years old. When I was strong enough, I dedicated my life to the study of fencing. So the next time we meet, I will not fail. I will go up to the sixfingered man and say, "Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die."
You know what a hurry we're in.
Let me explain-
Now, a clever man would put the poison into his own goblet, because he would know that only a great fool would reach for what he was given. I'm not a great fool, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But you must have known I was not a great fool; you would have counted on it, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.
What's so funny?
You guessed wrong.
Guess what.
I think this would be a marvelous opportunity for you, Roger.  Up to now, you've always been associated with musicals, and...
Enough.  It's better.  Please, Lambchop, it's better.  Stop. You're hurting it again.
But sir, I'm not condem ...
I assume you are making those cartoon noises to attract my attention.  Am I correct in my assumption, you fish-faced enemy of the people?
You have forty-eight seconds left. Hurry.  Hurry.
In looking at your books, I've discovered that ...
This is hardly a time for levity. I've discovered a serious error here in the accounts of your last play.
You were saying that under the right circumstances, a producer could make more money with a flop than he could with a hit.
Well, it's very easy.  You simply raise more money than you really need.
You've done it yourself, only you did it on a very small scale.
See?  You could have raised a million dollars, put on a sixty thousand dollar flop and kept the rest.
Oh, no.  No.  No.  I meant no scheme.  I merely posed a little, academic accounting theory.  It's just a thought.
No, Bloom, you don't understand. This is fate, this is destiny. There's no avoiding it.
I'm not going to jump on you!
What can I do?  What can I do? You're getting me hysterical.
They certainly do.  They certainly do.  Come, let me take you to lunch.
I don't know.  I think so.  I feel very strange.
They'll say, "Oooh, wah, wah, wah, ooh, ooh."
Here comes the Times Drama Critic.
Bloom, Bloom, maybe it's not true.
You think out of all those Hitlers you could find just one...
Vaaaat???
Five o'clock.  Killed a whole day playing hide-and-seek with a crazy Kraut.
Now ve take the two fuse leads, attach them to the terminals of the conductor and ve're in business.
Do you need us?
Ulla, I'd like you to meet my partner and associate, Mr. Leo Bloom.
We make love?
Finder's keepers.
Smasheroo.  Smasheroo.
Mr. Liebkind, Mr. Liebkind.
Lorenzo Saint DuBois.  But everybody calls me LSD.
Oh, in show business.  Well, let's put it this way, my next job will be my debut.
I told them we invaded England.
Committing myself to what? You sure talk like a Policeman.
How do you know she didn't make a call?
She was tired. She said she had a long drive ahead of her, in the morning... Yes, now I'm remembering very clearly because I'm picturing. When you make a picture of the moment in your mind, you can remember every detail. She was sitting back there, no she was standing up, with some sandwich still in her hand, and she said she had to drive a long way.
What?
She isn't still here, is she?
Sick old women are sharp. Come on, I won't disturb...
There's an old saying, "First customer of the day is always the most trouble!" But like I said, I'm in no mood for it so I'm just going to treat you so fair and square you won't have one human reason to give me...
I called her sister, Mr. Lowery, where she works, the Music Makers Music Store, you know? And she doesn't know where Mary is any more than we do.
She left Phoenix a week ago yesterday. And no trace until...
Mary had been there, one night, and had left.
He didn't mention the money.  What he said on the phone isn't important, is it?  He was supposed to come back after he spoke to the mother, and he didn't! That's what I want you to do something about!
Please!
Is something wrong?
I don't know where. In your store, somewhere in your town... anywhere.
And you thought she'd come up here, to me? If she had, what reason would she have for not calling you?
I was getting to that!
What do you know about it?
I ought to call the police right now!
She haven't even called you?
You want me to stay here?
She'll need both of us.
He'll be back. Let's sit still and hang on, okay?
You want to run out there, bust in on Arbogast and the sick old lady, shake her up and maybe spoil everything Arbogast's been building for the last three hours.
Sam, I'm going.
Just wait here?
Our Deputy sleeps.
Maybe I am the seeing-illusions type.
I wonder so many things about her now.  Why she never told me about you...  Funny, when you think there's an answer to everything, you think you know all the answers.
We have to go into that cabin and search it, Sam... no matter what we're afraid of finding and no matter how much it may hurt.
Sam, if you owned a useless business like this motel... one you probably couldn't even sell...  what would you need to get away, to start a new business, somewhere else?  Forty thousand dollars?
It's regular. Okay?
Sam. This is the last time.
For what?
I have to go, Sam.
And after the steak... do we send Sister to the movies and turn Mama's picture to the wall?
I'm fed up with sweating for people who aren't there. I sweat to pay off my father's debts... and he's in his grave... I sweat to pay my ex-wife alimony, and she's living on the other side of the world somewhere.
I pay, too. They also pay who meet in hotel rooms.
You know what I'd like? A clear, empty sky... and a plane, and us in it... and somewhere a private island for sale, where we can run around without our... shoes on.  And the wherewithal to buy what I'd like.  Mary, you want to cut this off, go out and find yourself someone available.
Don't miss your plane.
Dirty night.
Mother...  ...what is the phrase... "she isn't herself today"... I think that's it.
I'm sorry. I wish... people could apologize for other people.
You'd know, of course.
It's more than a hobby... sometimes... a hobby is supposed to pass the time, not fill it.
I'm looking for a private island.
Why do you ask that?
You should... mind it.
Except you.
I'm sorry... I didn't mean it to sound uncaring...
No, m'am.
He traced her there and called us to say he was going to question Mrs. Bates...
Barefaced.
Yes.
This place! This isn't 'a place.' It's my only world. I grew up in that house back there. I was a happy child. My mother and I... we were more than happy.
Do what?
Mother, she's just a stranger... hungry, and the weather's bad...
Go on, go tell her she'll not be appeasing her ugly appetite with my food... or my son! Or do I have to tell her, cause you don't have the guts? Huh, boy? You have the guts, boy?
Yes.
Yes! In the house behind the motel. I pounded and called but she... just ignored me.
Yeah, between the gangsters and the autos, we won't need another war to carry off the population.
Imagine--she was alive. What a horror. Could have been buried alive. She must have run away from the morgue.
That's only natural. Maxwell will be here around eight tonight.
That sounds to me very remarkable.
It may be, but to my notion, those that monkeys with what they got no business to get queer sooner or later.
He's been stealing my cats to experiment on [them]. I know cause I've been [watching] spying on him.
[Lot of] How many cats you have--what's the matter-- rats?
Oh, yes, he's in good hands now.
What's down there?
What are you going to do?
You're losing your blood?
What were you dreaming about?
The blood transfusion is now in progress. The only words are curt orders like: 'Now! - Quickly! - That's enough! - Give it to me! - Sit still!' etc.
The blood transfusion continues. Marc has positioned himself outside the circle of light from the lamp, so that he can see Nikolas in bright light, while he himself sits in the dark. Nikolas watches Léone's face anxiously and closely during her struggle with death. Life slowly seems to return to her, and her breathing becomes more peaceful. She opens her eyes and looks at the people round her, but she is much too enfeebled to speak, and closes her eyes again. Marc keeps a close watch on Nikolas, who grows paler and paler. His eyes swivel slowly from Nikolas to the patient and back to Nikolas again.
Another fragment of the diary is shown [having to do with vampires].
I wondered. Did he invite you to lunch, or did you invite him?
I don't see any big-moneyed boys running after you.
If you will forgive this poor, crippled stump, my dear, I am very happy to know you.
We'll be coming to the opening.
Oh, please, Mr. Igor, I'm terribly ashamed. I shouldn't have put you to so much trouble.
Hey, what do you think you're doing? Put that stuff back!
All right, what about it? We get out a paper just the same. Did you ever stop to think of that?
And how does one go about getting these human documents, may I inquire?
Whooey -- he took a run-out powder.
Well, that's got nothing to do with this case. Can I handle this my way?
No, there's another point I want to iron out.
I want to see the original pictures of Joan Gale.
Let it go.
I don't remember. Not so very far--
Fine. You're the first reporter in here for two hours. You people seeing the old year out?
Oh, yeah? Maybe she didn't commit suicide. She may have been murdered!
No use. He's a crab, I tell you.
Uh-huh. Do you remember what she said? What did you talk about?
Even those delicate veins, the texture of this flesh -- I have never seen anything more exquisite.
My partner believes that I should build a horror chamber, immortalizing the hideous crimes and criminals of London. At such times Marie Antoinette has reassured me, she has promised me recognition for the devotion I gave to her.
Well, what do you think I'm in this for?  Think of it, man, a match -- a cigar stub -- and ten thousand pounds to divide between us!
To lunch.
If you leave before the work is done, you will be gone for a much longer period ... you will be gone for good.
I'd be glad to, Mr. Igor.  I think I'll have somethin' to tell you soon.
She is the soul of that statue.
Good. Well, I'll be seeing you.
I've been dreaming about you.
No.  I didn't.   I'm listening.
She's in L.A., he's in the Bay area --
I didn't want to leave things the way we did.  Not this time.
Then you get it.  You'll understand.
Where is she?
I know, Mother.
In what sense were they bad?
He really did, he ate his little niece. He made pork chops out of her.
Buddy, I was horrible. I can't tell you who it was, but do you know what I did? I sat on his lap and got ahold of him and wiggled and wiggled my ass on him and was worse'n you could know, a child like you. Why, I let one of my tits fall out deliberate on purpose and practically smack him in the face with it and I let my dern skirt come up so he could see my drawers...  But to get back serious to what I was sayin', it is not only, Buddy, the loss of him but my own bad behavior what bothers me so...
You were pretty bad, huh?
But, Rose, how could such a thing as that happen?
Buddy, you don't realize it but what you're doing isn't nice.
I sure hope you don't.  I gotta get outta here, good night.
Here comes Daddy.
What are you going to do, Rose?
Well, that doctor said you got protein somewhere and I guess he was right.
I do, too!
You were up late last night, Brother.
I never saw anything like it. How did she pick him up so fast?
Is that Doctor still up there, Brother.
See that, son? Now this is a heel, see, and there, that's the ball of a foot. Someone has been walking here.
Daddy, what's the matter?
In the kitchen drinking all the ice water in Glenville. She walked out here, she didn't go by the hotel.
Brother, when I have to wake you up at eleven o'clock in the morning you're either sick or you were up very late last night.  And you weren't reading Huckleberry Finn. I looked and its not in your room. Now what were you doing?
Geccch, yehh, guhhhh!
No, you didn't say that, Brother.
Excuse me, gotta go to bathroom.
Now I have a plan about Rose, an educational plan. She's getting better and we don't want any more trouble --  Brother, you ought to hear this.
Daddy says Rose is calm as lettuce. Do you believe that, Doll?
Is that all?
She's putting the titty back.
Chattanooga. I had St. Louis, Missouri.
A baby... and she isn't even married.
Oh, I heard from her, I got a letter from her, she's fine. But there is some sad news.
It always gives me a funny feeling to come home. Dear old Southland. Gone. It's all gone, Daddy --  -- except you, you're still here.
I'm older than hell, boy. But this Yankee whisky is mighty fine, I'll say that.
Nobody lives forever, boy. Who'd want to?
Well, it's a disaster. I don't know what to say, Doctor, I am floored. How dangerous is the operation?
It isn't the fourth dimension. To you it's the fourth dimension, maybe, to me it's simply the truth.
Oh. Did you say something?
I love Rosebud, I am wild about Rosebud. I just hope she doesn't turn out to be a hidden hotcha character, that's all. We have growing children in the house.
I'm not in the fourth dimension --  -- you are in the fourth dimension, when you allow skepticism and doubt to take control. As Blake said, if God had doubt the sun would go out.
They'll put her in jail. The damn little fool might as well be naked.
She will succeed.
-- I am not responsible for her epizootics and I did not bring about her epizootics. Now listen to me. When I have to get up in the middle of the night and defend my home with a shotgun against a couple of damned scoundrels fistfighting in the bushes --
And when I try to talk to you seriously, when I try to explain to you the unlimited creative power of life, how beautiful it would be if we gave up this hopeless struggle and simply loved each other from our hearts, what do you do -- you mock me!
That is exactly what I'm afraid of.  The girl has got to go, darlin'.
But morals come from the heart, not from rigid rules and empty laws. And in her heart Rose has never hurt anyone and she never would. Therefore, she's not immoral. Not really.
Well, I have a pretty good idea.
I can't stand that polecat. They ought to hang him.
That's why I'm asking her who the father is. It's the most vital question of all. Who's the father, dear?
What did you forget?
This conversation is making me a little sick.
I thought I knew you. I thought I knew you better, I thought in your heart you were a good and kind man. Well, I can't believe what I've just heard in this room. A defenseless girl depending on you for protection, and you propose to mutilate and destroy her. How could you listen even for a moment to that sadistic man?
I can't believe you really meant it, if I did I'd want to die. You aren't a male monster, that man is but you aren't. Look me in the eye and tell me, do you really want to take Rose's womanhood away from her when it's all she has got?
Well, yes, she's happy. Of course Dave doesn't have her life force, not at all. There isn't much furniture in his house, just a table and one or two chairs, whereas Rose has furniture coming out of the windows.
Oh, I don't know, I... I...
You're so sweet.
Umm. Well. Yes. But no more strange voices in the night, Rose.
I mean a human investment, Rose, we care about you, you matter to us. But we have innocent and unformed children in this house and the monkey and dog show has got to stop. Do you hear me?
Well, Mr. Hillyer, Billy's very poor, he don't have no money and there wasn't no place else to go.
What baby? What baby? What baby are you speaking about?
Well, we know you were there. The bill that hospital sent was absolutely horrendous.
Well, I... I... ah-h, let's see...
Well, Mrs. Hillyer, the girl is strong as an ox and that is what is keeping her alive. But not many people walk away from double pneumonia, Madam, not many.
Afraid of the hospital?
Yes, thank you, Doctor.
I'm not surprised you thought she was pregnant. An ovarian cyst can look very much like pregnancy. But it was pure wishful thinking on her part. The girl can never have children, she had gonorrhea at fifteen and it was untreated.
Don't worry, Madam, she can't infect your dear little kiddies. She long ago fully recovered, but the disease did irreparable damage. The girl is permanently barren.
We make our own lives, Madam. As for malignancy, I don't think so, it's very unlikely. I probably shouldn't have even mentioned that possibility to her.
Yes, go on.
Actually of course I won't operate, I don't do major surgery. Dr. Hardy will operate and of course he'll be guided by your wishes in this respect.
I don't want to go to the dentist.
Well, you're real sweet to make it for me.  There never was nobody like you. And you don't need to worry, I ain't goin' out no more.
Well, there's no reason you shouldn't go out, Rose... in moderation.
Well, I... I... I don't know... maybe it was... but no, you can't be sure about a thing like that. It wasn't Billy, I didn't know him.
Rose, you don't have to.
I'll tell you what... I think it's all you've got.
Hey, listen... I'll give you something else, Kittle.  Anything. Remember... remember that corpse washed up on Huntington Beach?  It was never identified...
Oh, you fuckers!  You fucking fuckers!  What?  What do you want?
Hey now... what the fuck... ?
Know what he's doing, Benny?  He's trying to jog your memory.
Last time Billy-Boy did this, the guy's neck broke...  ... just like that.  Sad in a way. Why is it we don't truly appreciate our arms and legs till we've lost the use of them?
Just a little, you know... Bicentennial memento.  Nothing special.
Where you gonna be?
Clench your teeth.
Dean Martin.
Okay, seriously.  What about Napoleon, huh?
What about him?
You been wearing rubbers, Billy-Boy?
Wha... ?
You know, the more weight back there, the faster the car goes.
Bullshit.
Who said it wa's me, hub?  Anyway... he fell off a ladder.  It wasn't really my fault.
What about Jack Daniels?  Wasn't he a decorated general in the Civil War?
General Jim Beam, then.
Feels like there's a bullet still in my chest.
There probably is.
Maybe.
You mean taking bribes, and skimming busts and letting hoods walk? You mean not being able to sleep at night after shaking down some honest Joe?
You bust some small-time pimps, whores and dime-bag junkies, like the world's a better place because you're in it.  And for what, Kittle... two hundred and fifty dollars a week? Tell me, how does anyone get so self-rightious when they can barely afford to pay their rent?
I just think you should show some respect.  I mean, call me old fashioned, but 200 years ago when Ben Franklin and those guys signed the Constitution and Declaration of Independence, they did that so we could all share in the freedom...
First of all, the Constitution wasn't writtem till 1787...
You... SUCK!  You almost got us all killed!
Oh yeah?
Yeah, my arms healed up real good, and that's how I wanna keep 'em. That's what I'm trying to tell you.
You need a doctor.
Any preferences?
Know what I love about dynamite?
I don't think so.
It's one of a kind.
Admiral, we're in position. All fighters accounted for.
I can't do it, Artoo. I can't go on alone.
You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father.
Oh, no, my young Jedi. You will find that it is you who are mistaken...about a great many things.
Luke!
Wouldn't miss it.
How are we doing?
The same as always.
There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know.
Will you take it easy? Let's just figure out a way to get out of this thing.  Han, can you reach my lightsaber?
Somehow, I got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
I'm sorry.
Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment.
The code's changed. We need Artoo!
Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately.
We're coming!
We shall double our efforts.
All wings report in.
Just...images, really. Feelings.
Tell me.
Yes. It's you Leia.
I know. Somehow...I've always known.
I know, father.
Well, I'm sorry.
I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can readily...
I see.  So this wasn't simply a chance meeting.  You came here with a purpose.
And Ralph himself will be in line for promotion in a year or so.
Uh huh.
Oh Brad, I'm frightened.  What kind of place is this?
For God's sake keep a grip on yourself Janet.
I'm Brad Majors and this is my fiancee, Janet Vice.
No, don't do that.
What a guy
Goodbye
Was all I had to say
Oh my, my,
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
No no no no.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime. That ain't no crime.
No no no no.
...I don't know.
...Aren't you skating?
Y'know how I got started in the fight racket?
Do you have a phone?
I think he might be worried.
What's the problem? You don't like me -- Don't like the turtles -- What is it?
It's all right -- You're my guest.
...What?
Yes.
...Are you going to say anything to him?
...What?
What did you say about a pet shop?
Is everything all right?
Like it would make a difference if you were, right? This guy's a friend and now he's takin' ya out.
That so.
You gave me what?! Knots! You gave me knots in here every day -- you made me scared of everything!
Cover the ribs -- Look here, elbow down, tight -- Tight -- stand straight -- you're the best, you're the best!
He was big, an' very nasty so I destroyed him in a hurry -- Now I'm gettin' ready for Mac Lee Green next month.
That's right -- It's gonna be the greatest sportin' event in this country's history -- A gala occurrence!
I don't like ya face.
...No wine -- Bad for ya' brain.
The Champ stings the slower challenger with jabs at will -- Balboa blocks eighty percent of the blows with his face -- Creed doesn't look the best he's ever been but is moving smoothly -- Creed snaps out a triple combination that backs Balboa into a corner -- oh, a solid hook by Creed, a master of fist-men.
Don't hit the face! Not the face!!
Ya still light seventy.
Yo Rock. Did I give you a job this mornin? How come ya didn't break this guy's thumb like I asked ya? When ya don't do what ya are told, it makes me look bad, kid.
Hey, screw ya brain on right. Now, who's this girl you're going out with tonight?
Y'know I won't be able to work for ya no more.
...Like I said, I'd make a boss sparrin' mate.
Why?
I won't.
Dipper's a climber -- You're a tomato.
...Tomato?
...Who'd ya fight?
A Rep from Miles Jergens' Promotions was lookin' for ya -- They need sparrin' partners for Creed.
Here's the card?
Probably lookin' for sparrin' partners.
Freak luck for sure.
...What?
Gimme the water! Ya gettin' tagged with his right. I think you should feint left and high hook 'im -- Benny, check the eyes! Can ya see?
Startin' with the bad jokes early today, huh.
Bullmastiff.
The owner was suppose to pick him up three weeks ago.
I usta be deadly at half-ball.
Do me a favor -- Talk to Gazzo. Tell him I'm a friend an' would do a good job... Tell him I ain't bothered by nothin' an' would be a great collector... Bustin' bones don't bother me -- Tell him I'm a good worker.
I'll do okay.
How 'bout you talk to 'em about me?  Please do me that favor.
Ya really like her?
...I can't haul meat no more.
And another thing, the paper said no will was found.  But every Toon knows Acme had a will and, in it he promised to leave Toontown to the Toons.
My hunch is it was Maroon.  He always was after Acme's property.
Don't worry about me.  I can take it.
You'll have it in the morning.  Now be a sport and lemme have twenty bucks to put in my pocket.
Is this paper even good?
Do you think the rabbit did it?
The rabbit's wife?  Wanna tell me what she was doin' with her arms around you?
Are you gonna call him, Eddie?
Being caught breaking and entering is not very good advertising for a detective.  What were you looking for, Mr. Valiant?
No matter.  I don't expect the will to show up in the next fifteen minutes.  By then Cloverleaf will own Toontown quite legally.
Right here where we're standing, will be the cornerstone of my idea... the cloverleaf -- an elegant cement structure that intertwines freeways.
You're a pig... a happy-go-lucky pig.
No...
Yeah, I'll bet you would.  You gotta have the rabbit to make the scam work.
You shot Roger.
I got him on loan from Disney.
Valiant?  What're you doin' here?
Aah!
Well, I asked the newsboy on the corner.  He didn't know.  Then I asked a janitor, the fireman and finally the green grocer down the way.  He was very helpful.
Look, pal, if you're still here when I finish this drink, I'm callin' the police.
Hey, don't I get an encore?
Just because you got 'em to laugh?
A laugh can be a powerful thing, Eddie. Sometimes it's the only weapon we have in life.
Here you go, kid... say hi to Casper for me.
You damn Toon!  No wonder they picked you for the patsy.  Always gotta play the fool.  You make me sick!
Yeah, everybody thought so.  But me and Teddy got a kick out of Toons.  All Toons.  We couldn't see the bad in 'em. And when this guy was accused of knockin' over the First National Bank of Toontown, we took his case.  But when we looked into it, we found out he did do it after all.  We went to his house to take him in.  But he was wise. He got the drop on us... literally.
Safe?
Wrong number?
I tell you what, maybe I better come with you.
Real good, Rog... but maybe you better let me take over.
Pretty good cigar.  Where'd you get it?
If she is well then nothing can be ill. Her body rests in Capel's monument, and her immortal part with the angel's lives. I saw her laid low. Pardon me for bringing these ill news.
Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.
Why that pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline. Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.
Any man that can write may answer a letter.
Thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Verona.
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
No, cuz, I rather weep.
Farewell, my cuz.
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
This wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves; Supper is done, and we shall come too late.
Drink it off and, if you had the strength of twenty men it would dispatch you straight.
If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help Do thou but call my resolution wise, And with this I'll help it presently!
Young son, it argues a distemper'd head so soon to bid good marrow to thy bed: or if not so so, then here I hit it right, our Romeo hath not seen his bed tonight.
I come for my lady Juliet.
No, madam. We have culled such necessaries as our behoveful for our state tomorrow. so please you, let me now be left alone, and let the nurse this night sit up with you. for I am sure you have your hands full in all this so sudden business.
Juliet!
Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed. If that thy bent of love be honourable, Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow, By one that I'll procure to come to thee, Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite; And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
I uh, by and by I come--But if thou mean'st not well, I do beseech thee--
I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news: I pray thee, speak.
But all this did I know before. What says he of our marriage? what of that?
Speakest thou from thy heart?
And from my soul too. Else beshrew them both.
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
'Tis but thy name that is my enemy; Thou art thyself, though not a Montague. What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot, Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part Belonging to a man. O, be some other name! What's in a name? that which we call a rose By any other word would smell as sweet; So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd, Retain that dear perfection which he owes Without that title. O Romeo, doff thy name, And for that name which is no part of thee Take all myself.
Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?
Do not swear at all; Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self, Which is the god of my idolatry, And I'll believe thee.
If my heart's dear love--
By the hour of nine.
Let me be taken, let me be put to death. I have more care to stay then will to go. Come death, Welcome, Juliet wills it so. How is't my soul? Let us talk it is not day.
Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.
'Twill serve. Ask for me tomorrow and you shall find me a grave man. A plague o' both your houses. They have made worms meat of me. A plague on both your Houses! Why the devil did you come between us? I was hurt under your arm.
Is she a Capulet?
So where do you go from here?
It's good to see you've all got such faith in our little undertaking.
What is?
Budweiser?  You talk to me of beer and you've the unbridled gall to mention Budweiser in the same sentence?  That's not beer!  Christ, it's not even a poor excuse for rabbit piss.
It means I was worried that all the time you spent away from the fold might have affected you.  You've been living the life of the hired gun -- the well paid hired gun, I might note.  There's no glory to it, but there are those that like it.
Not to me, you know that.
Lose them!
You're thinking with your gun, Seamus, and not your head...
Do I need to repeat myself?
You were a soldier, were you?
I still am.
You don't have to explain yourself to me, Deirdre.
Oh please..you're on some sort of holy mission?
I'm a patriate.
Don't even think that I'm buying that.
Alright, Gregor, I'm...
Don't do it, Sam!
Perhaps we could both go at the same time...
In here...
What am I doing here?  Why, I'm here to see my partners, Gregor, the boys in the Russian Mafia.  See, your bosses had hoped to screw me by hiring you to pull your thieving double cross.  But they only just found out that what's in the briefcase is completely useless without me.  I can't fight them, and they can't kill me -- that means we're gonna have to do business together.
But you hate each other!
So, you've got it all figured, do you?
Sent it where?
It was a mistake, it shouldn't have happened.
I'm in the middle of saving you people a great deal of money -- the least you could do is have the decency to pay me!
So what do we do?
Then I guess we're set.
There is one other thing...
I've never seen a man who could have taken what he just went through.  He's a cop?
But first you have something to take care of?
Yeah.
He sees this differently, as you well know.
Created?
Vincent's life is his own burden; he'll have to carry it for himself.  And I'm not any kind of Samurai.
What makes you think we're here to meet you?
Where to?
That was a nice move you did on our young friend.  Judo?
Not at all.  Similar, but not the same.
A cigarette?  As in one?  One cigarette a week, who smokes like that?
Let's just say I thought the conversational possibilities were limited.  Of course, I might have brought Gregor, but he didn't seem like the right candidate -- for this.
I wonder if she truly left the IRA.
What's going on?
Know what?
I hope you don't mind I took your pack. It was on the table.
It isn't about money for me, not anymore.
You don't have to do this.
I would have tried not to.  But yes, if it would have kept him from shooting you, I would have.
They don't have the package.
You think?
I don't know...
Not here.  They might see it.
Gone.  Destroyed.
What's the story?
Gaelic.
You sure?
Shut up!  Not another word out of you!  You're going down, the Feds know all about it!  You didn't know some of it was marked, did you! Where's the rest?
He would have won more but he blew it at the end.  Didn't know what Cash and Carry was.
I probably would have.  I guess the clues damn near before everyone.
Well someone's gonna find them.
I told Trudy we were coming down this way, that's why!
I'll worry about that when it happens and if it happens, and it's not gonna happen!
What makes you so sure?
Oh so God's like Western Union and he just dropped us a couple million bucks?
We'll leave a few packets in the trunk, and stash the rest somewhere else.  Car went up in the gunfight.
I'm not letting some gangbanger send me to jail.  We can't risk it.
Well neither have I, but it's us or him.  If he talks, or writes a note, or whatever, he's gonna turn us in.  Besides, he's a low life scumbag.  His kind is hardly even human anyway.
Okay then.  I'll do it.
That's not what I mean.
How long you been lying there playing possum with us, huh? Answer me!
All we have to do is get our hands on the original tape.  We'll set him up somehow.
No.
Maybe we can reason with Jesse, give him a third in exchange for the tape.
I don't think he's going to be doing any bargaining with us, the stupid son-of-a-bitch!  Besides, I'm not giving him a third of anything, not after everything we had to do.
How badly do you want that money?! How bad do you want to stay out of jail?
Here it is.
Even if we have the tape, that wouldn't shut him up!
Jesus Christ Earl...what are we doing?...
We're doing what we gotta do, to protect ourselves!
We're not?  How do you figure that?
And you're solid on that?
Well I don't know what's going to happen next -- she's pressing this, another interrogation, another problem.
What for?
Yeah.
OK.
Sally?  I was beginning to think he wasn't gonna leave.
How the hell did he find it?
Let's hope so. SALLY If he asks me again, I'm gonna tell him I returned it all.
A satellite dish?
I don't know, Booth.
What did he buy?
Be more specific.  A month, a week...
What?
What is this?  Don't be stupid man...
What do you think about all this?
Oh that was Agent Wallace.  We're going to check into something.
Not exactly.  It's some lingerie store on the strip.
Vegas!  Can you hightail it back here by three o'clock?
Well, we got the DEA coming down here again, I don't know, sounds to me like they got some more questions they want to ask us.
Well they really didn't go into any details on the phone, but they did ask for you, and I figure we should try to help them out as best we can.
No.  Something wrong with you Dwayne?
Suppose I'm not exciting enough for you.
You're never getting that much.
Easy to purchase, hard to detect. Too much potassium can kill a man.  Just have to...pick a discreet spot.
Nope. If you're a criminal you don't carry ID, and if you do you're a damn fool.
And what happened?
You want to hear the good news first, or the bad news?
Not in the trunk.
Do you know what happened yesterday, Carter?  I was officially nominated for the Commissioner's post for the LAPD. There was a dinner last night, two hundred LAPD officers were there.
What the hell is that?
Two-hundred thousand!
Winner!  Four, winner!
The band has been playing over an hour.
How'd you know?
How you doing, baby?  My name is Prince Mubutu from Nigeria.
Isabella Molina, from San Juan.  That seat is taken.
That's right.  I'm the owner, the Captain -- you can call me El Capitan.
I don't want to play games with you, Isabella.  I like you.  I can see myself with you -- in one of those bathrooms over there in about five minutes.
I know you, Detective Carter, right? You're Lee's American friend.  Enjoying your visit?
It's no problem.  But I must excuse myself, inspector.
Do you have it in you, Lee?  Or are you gonna spend the rest of your life hiding like your father?
Any girl?  Okay.  Let's start with that one.
Wait a second.  You're Steven Reign? You're big time.  You own all them big hotels.  What are you doing in Hong Kong?
Vegas has been my town for 30 years.  I crawled out from under the first rock. Do you really think you can intimidate me here?
All I did was invite them for a drink.
That's what I'm talking about.  A real Hong Kong night club.  You want an Altoid?
Carter, get off that stage!
This is a gangster bar, we're here undercover.
I knew you were lying.
Carter, you don't understand.  These men are Fu-Cang-Long Triads.  Part of the most deadly gang in China.
What'd I say?
Stop!  I'm sick of your bullshit!
Carter?
So are you getting on the plane or not?!
Come on, we still got time to order the Kosher meal.  Always get the kosher meal, they bring it first.
Not bad.  Now every crime, somewhere, has a rich white man taking his cut. Every single one.  Now in our case, we know the rich white man is Steven Reign.
How do you know he's our man?
Carter, there's something I have to tell you.  You were right about what you said in Hong Kong.  All I do is work.  Never take a day off.  It's all I have right now.
It's a long story.
No.  It was my singing.
Is it hot in here?
She never even looked at you.
See you in the next world.
I believe in heaven.  You people believe in heaven?
I thought it might be like those five foot and under basketball leagues.  They don't let everybody in.
Mind your own business.
As long as you're asking...I think you have a pretty good voice.
It's focus.  Every opponent has a weak spot.  You ignore everything around you, and put all your energy into one perfect strike.
Hello, Benjamin.
Oh no you don't.  Don't you be getting corny on me, Lee.  I'll kick your ass from here to Compton.
Let's go.
We made it, man.
I saw that.  She kissed you, didn't she? You played it cool, though.  Walking away, never looking back.
First class.
Are you okay?
Escort Detective Carter to the airport --
The police can protect you.
I know, Master, but...
The answers you seek can be found in Heaven on Earth.
Heaven on Earth?  Master, I don't understand.  A temple, where Heaven is on Earth?  A mountain, where Earth reaches for the --
In used currency.  Nothing bigger than a fifty.
Carter.  I just want to be able to tell the Ambassador who was responsible for the death of his daughter because he talked too much.
Feds asked for me?
I didn't say I didn't.  You assumed I didn't.
You're a regular god damn acrobat, aren't you?  Bet you feel real good makin' me look like an asshole.
It was not my intent --
It was my ass that almost got trashed!
You know War?
Good God, ya'll!
No, fish is a PM food.
What are you doing here?
What a surprise!
It's Hong Kong, not Tokyo.  My country asked for the best.  I told them that was you.  Now I will show you around my Œhood.
No shark fin, no camel hump.  What you listenin' to?
Oh, you're not gonna believe what they put me in charge of.  They sent for the Ambassador's personal Chinese Investigator type.  He is like the baddest Asian shield they got.  And I, let me repeat that, I am the man who is on the case with him.  Just the two of us, alone, workin' the whole deal as a team.
Look at me! My dress is ruined. I look like shit.
At this point we don't have much.
You a cop or something?
How did I do this?! Maybe you didn't notice but I'm in jail!
Yes.
Yes.
I understand, sir. But you are an honored guest of the United States...
I still have work to do here.
What is he up to now?
Let him come to the wedding.  You're not running, right?  Say it. "I'm not..."
Right.
See you at the wedding.
Really?
Only respectful things.  What did we have in common back then... What kind of music did you like... Did you ruin my life when you left me standing at the altar...
I love his eyes.  I just believe they're listening to you.
That's not nothing to do with it.  You cooked this story up and you know it.
Or a vegetarian?
Vindication.  How would you like to get some?  A chance to prove that, though your facts weren't entirely straight, your theory was correct.
Not bad.  I was traveling around studying the reproductive and migratory patterns of locusts when Maggie met me.
Same as you said.  What did you call her?  A "man-eater", "a devouring death goddess."
Good fact.  Well, you let me know.
It's okay.  There's no microphone. You're no fun.
I am just such a reporter.  And you are?
Betty Trout.  Five dollars.
Well, instead of a haircut, how about a wash?  You know, get all that city grit out of it.
Oh, but making up the facts as you go along is ethical?  Actually, I meant you.  You probably got severance or expenses or both.  I'll take your check. No credit cards.
Too much.
You afraid to try?
No.  I think I said something eloquent like, "So, uh -- maybe we should, ya know.  What do you think?"
You don't know.
I'll have the same.
No.  But I think attraction is too often mistaken for rightness. Attraction is very misleading.  And if it's mutual, it's well, terribly distracting.
Where did you disappear to?
Excuse me?
I'm the only goddamn person in there pulling for you.
What kind of Dead Head gets a temporary tattoo?
Or maybe you just wanted to wear the headdress.
I'm okay with that.
Yes, I did.
Pretty good speech, Maggie.
So -- Mag -- you've seen this, huh?
I didn't even need to change this gasket, just put in a little hydraulic fluid.
Good morning to you, too.  You look good.
I know.  I think sometimes you just sort of spaz-out with random excess flirtation energy and it just lands on anything male that moves.
No.  I'm weird.  Weird and mysterious are two different things.
No.  You're quirky.  Quirky and weird are two different things.
Grandma!
No, no.  I saw eight geese flying in a "V".
Wedding.  Wedding.  You just have to get the rest of your ducks in a row.
I'm really rooting for this one.
A harmless joke.
No, you tell her.
What am I going to do with a microwave?
He's got a houseboat.
Boats.  All anyone talks about is the wind.  Is it up, is it down.  I can't live with a man who only talks about the wind.
Walter, I'd love to --
That doesn't make any sense.
Walter.
Beautiful view, isn't it?
-- it was a betrayal.
You should write something about this.
You're a basket case.
I'm going to marry Walter.  I just have to get this out of my system.
What?
Your destiny can be your doom. Look at me and Rick.
You want to hear about destiny? If my husband hadn't gone on a diet, which caused me to leave him, I would never have been on that flight to Miami, and met Rick, and ended up having sex in the bathroom of a 727 with that nob you slide that says "vacant-occupied, vacant- occupied, vacant-occupied" -- 
Yes.
You told a lie and got on a plane.
No.  That's the weirdest part about it.
You know that dream where you're walking down the street naked and everyone is looking at you?
Do you want a matrimonial, past wives, any kids--
A sense of humor.
I'll tell you the truth, I heard this guy on a call-in radio show and I might not marry the person I should marry because I've become obsessed with him.
He wasn't even wrong for you, like <u>cosmically</u> wrong, so don't beat up on yourself for wasting...however long it was.
I don't even know him.  But I'm having all these fantasies about a man I've never met, who lives in Seattle.
Everybody! Annie has an announcement --
The Historical Society wanted this and I never would give it to them --
I know.  He's wonderful, isn't he?
How amazing.
You know.
What?
You touch her for the first time, and suddenly... you're home.  It's almost like...
Good.  How long ago did your wife die?
Where's your mom?
And you're worried about him.
They met at the Empire State Building, only they didn't. Never mind.
Eighty dollars.
Just out of curiosity, do you have any friends whose names don't begin with a J?  I feel like it was a failure of the imagination on our part naming you Jonah.  What is marjoram? Does anyone know?
Just out of curiosity, how did they get our address?
How did they get our phone number?
Oklahoma.  Do you know where that is?
Will she scratch up your back?
Bye bye blackbird.
Is that what she used to sing?
I never did.  Or the whole idea of an afterlife.  But I don't know any more.  I have these dreams about... your mom... and we have long talks about... about you, and how you are, which she sort of knows but I tell her anyway.  So what is that? It's sort of an afterlife, isn't it?
I'm starting to forget her.
I... uh... have a date with someone Friday night.
There's a bathroom upstairs.
Did you call that radio station again?
It's a short word.
Dad, I was talking to Jessica about reincarnation, and she thinks that probably you knew Annie in another life.
I'm not leaving this room until you say yes.
If I didn't go.
You could have called me --
No thanks.
Three hours! Just to heat enough water to wash this stuff!  I tell you something. If this strike is ever settled -- which I doubt -- I don't go back to work unless the company installs hot running water for us.  It should've been a union demand from the beginning.
It's like Charley Vidal says -- there's two kinds of slavery, wage slavery and domestic slavery. The Woman Question, he calls it.
No, Estellita.
So they had a little taste of what its like to be a woman ... and they run away.
You are no good to me -- in jail.
You all right?
I'm okay. But it's nice to be home.
All right, but later. I've got a meeting now.
No.
You mean you're ready to give up?
Will you be still?
It's possible. Just negotiate.
Where's your mama?
Boy! Did you see the way Mama whopped that deputy with her shoe? Knocked the gun right out ...
Ramón ... listen to me ... I'm in a	jam ... I had to get a job ...
Ramón -- listen my kids ...
That's it?
What?
Yeah, but he was in silhouette.
How?
Turns out I'm allergic to steel-toed boots. Go figure.  By the way, I'm not looking for a matching set.  Where's Quincey?
Like you?
Why?
That's when he called me. He told me his story and he pitched me a plan.
Oh shit
What?
Maybe I am dealing with it.
Why's that?
That's a good one.
So, why'd you want to see me?
Yeah, that's what I mean.  Where the hell does this guy live anyway?
John Fitzgerald Kennedy.
What?
I don't trust anybody.
By not disgracing her memory!
So that's 40 lbs. at 6 a pound then?
If you say so.
This is bullshit.  You didn't say anything about anybody else being here.
God damn, Flynne, you are one observant tweaker.
Garcetti thinks I'm a pile of shit.
When?
What're your taking down?
What? Is it bad?
Dude is bugging.  Transparent spiders, plastic men - the whole nine yards.
Yeah.  What about him?
We know what's going on.
What do you mean?
We all know how much you like hearing that. Okay, Liz, I was wrong. There.  You happy?
She's 57 and she's been teaching third grade for the last 33 years.
Sector four is secured, we put out the last three German one-fifty-fives, found them about two miles in from Ponte du Hoc.
They didn't want to give up those one-fifty-fives, sir.
He's the last of four brothers, the other three were killed in action. This is straight from the Chief of Staff.
As a matter of fact, I am.
So they travel around from place to place and preach?
Yep.
Well, I'll be goddamned, I knew it.
Jackson, how many times I got to tell you, you're from Tennessee.
Yes, sir.  It seems to me, sir, that the entire resources of the United States Army oughta be dedicated to one thing and one thing only, and that is to put me and this here weapon on a rooftop, smack-dab in the middle of Berlin, Germany.  Now I ain't one to question decisions made up on high, sir, but it seems to me that saving one private, no matter how grievous the losses of his family, is a waste of my God-given talent.
Sorry, sir, fresh out of trucks, how 'bout a '38 Ford Roadster, hard-top, red with black interior.
No white-walls, sir, there's a war on.  NOT THERE, YOU GODDAMNED IDIOT, OVER THERE!  I can't help you, sir.
I know about bracketing.  I read about it.  The next one is going to land right on us.
Glad of it.
It looks like a Renoir.
What is it?
I'd like to stay, too, Captain.
Okay, Wade.  Translators?
He's right, Captain, it might be kind of dangerous for those flyboys.
Oh, yeah?
I know.
Sarge, see what you can do to make those buildings inhospitable.
Captain, can I put in for a transfer?
I don't think so, Captain.
Sorry, I need a B.A.R. man, you're the best.
Captain, I gotta tell you, the irony of this mission is fucking killing me.
Sir, you know what Ramelle is famous for?  Cheese.  The rest of the company is going to Caen and we're going to the goddamned cheese capital of France.  There is no bright side.
Captain, could you please explain the math of this mission to me?
Sure, what do you want to know?
Huh?
Except for the last part, that one's not bad.
I don't like that one.
You're only allowed to shoot at Germans, that's one of the rules.
I wonder if his cabin is still available?
Hears the FAINT DISTANT RUMBLE OF THE TANK.  Barely has time to react. Sees:
FIRES a burst.  Germans drops.
Private.  I'm sorry about your brothers but staying here and getting yourself killed isn't going to help.
The hell you aren't, you're comin' with me if I have to drag you every inch of the way.  You hear me, Private?
Thank you, sir.
Jackson was from West Fork, Tennessee, he was going to be a preacher, his father and uncles have a traveling ministry out of the back of a stretch Hudson.
And Sarge?
That's because, as I have pointed out on numerous occasions, you are a happy idiot.
Sir, I ran the 220 in high school.
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
You think he really believed it?
That's right.
Hi.
Yeah, she won a fellowship.
Good for her.
Oh yeah, let me give you another card.
You're tough, J-man.
Hello Constance.  It's me, Lloyd... nothing, I'm just driving around... she broke up with me... what do I do?  Can't she come back?  How can I get her back?... I can't think, talk to me... I fucked up... I feel like crying... she gave me a pen.  I gave her my heart and she gave me a pen.
Please?
Lloyd, send her flowers, write her a letter.  Something.
Look at his face, he did the deed.
Oh yeah!
Alright, no more, I'm going to save it.
God, that's... this is ridiculous.
I'm sorry.
Are you kidding?  You're not kidding?  You're not kidding!
Morning honey.
Wait a minute.  How was Lloyd?
You should be.
You bet you should have called.  You still live at home.  Don't make me call the police at three-thirty in the morning, don't make me call hospitals.
Honey!
I swear to god.
What am I supposed to think?
Hello.
You will?
Yeah.  What a day.
Saturday, I have some things to do around the house.
He does this every year?
Have a good sleep.
Nobody knew me before tonight.
Basic.  Hmmm.
So what's your job this summer?
Okay, bye, I will.
Yes.
Yeah?
Little more gas.  Ease it up.  Hold on- minor setback.  Now you feel confident, right?
Are you comfortable?
I don't think so.
Then why are you shaking?
Uh-huh.  It was wonderful.
How do you know what I'm going to say?
What?  This is a good level, isn't it?
No, I don't, I don't.
Yeah you do.
Is this because of your dad?
She figured it out.  I'm sorry if that upsets you.
I love you.
So when you hear the smoking sign go 'ding', you know everything's going to be okay.
Man, all you gotta do is find a girl who looks just like her, nail her, and then dump her man, get her off your mind.
Are you going to England with her Lloyd?
You're not a permanent part of her life.  You're a distraction.
Stop freaking with her head man.  Just stop playing with her mind, you know?  She's a human being.  She's a person.  She's very talented, you know.
Oh boy.
This is great, this gives me hope.  Thanks.
I was gonna...
We finally graduated, big dude guy!
Alright, I love you too. Go to sleep.
Things worked out.  I made some money over there, had some laughs, you know. It was good.
Oskar, please -
You know, they told me you were going to be trouble - Czurda and Scherner.
Every day that goes by, I'm losing money. Every worker that is shot, costs me money - I have to get somebody else, I have to train them -
Scherner told me something else about you.
That you know the meaning of the word gratitude.  That it's not some vague thing with you like with some guys.
I tried to call you, I'm running a little late, this is taking longer than I thought.  Have a drink.
They're taking mine.  When I said they didn't have a future I didn't mean tomorrow.  Auschwitz.
I just told you.
The SS beat me up.  They would have killed me, but I'm essential to the war effort, thanks to you.
Are you kidding, I never miss a party. Police Chief Rasch, my wife Emilie.
Thank you.
What others?
Once the war ends, forget it, but for now it's great, you could make a fortune. Don't you think?
Pots and pans.
The Jewish worker's salary, you pay it directly to the SS, not to the worker. He gets nothing.
This, I don't know, maybe you can trade it for something.
No, I'm not losing money, that's not the point.
They arrived.
They're withholding payment.
If I'd made more money ...I threw away so much money, you have no idea. If I'd just ...
I lost a day of production.  I lost a worker.  I expect to be compensated.
The killer was trying to get to her. That sorority girl was a distraction.
Jesus Christ. Captain Tyler flies out of his seat and into action.
thought he was doing AA.
...campus security...send someone...check out...place...
Someone who wants to talk to you.
That's too bad.
Already did. He's the perfect suspect, don't you think?
No, I don't.
I couldn’t believe you didn’t recognize me. You even interviewed me for your book.
"And I hope life treats you kind and I hope you have all you dreamed of offffff. I wish you JOYYY."
Are they aware of your not so positive portrayal of Greek life?
Where's Sid?
No way.
Lemme take you home.
My screwed up life shouldn't have to bleed onto my friends.
I had the four o'clock shift. You weren't there. You had us worried. Is everything okay?
No, it's not.
What guy?
Need some help, honey.
A verdict and premiere all on the same day. I love it.
Yeah, we really had our work cut out for us. It really is the curse of the sequel. The Billy/Stu thing’s been done.
I think you're all an act.
Not good. How you doin?
What are we looking for?
Maybe not. But think about the sex. As frustrated as I am...
And Joel's pre-med.
Three hundred people watched? Nobody did anything?
Don't worry...
What do you want?
Where are you?
You're getting obvious.
Are you in danger now?
Where is your attacker?
Her old boyfriend?
And white.
Perfect. I'll be outta Micro-bio and we can grab a bite.
Ne ask that you sell individual squares of toilet paper for a mere nickel a piece.
..harmonica style is okay.
Listen to me. We've got to get help. The Killer's here.
I'm sorry, Sid, please. I never should have gone along with Gale. I know I'm stupid. I wish I had some good reason to give you but I'm just stupid. Please, Sid, don't be mad at me.
It's CICI! Cici's the name of the character she plays in the movie!
Very good. Now we play ROUND 2.
Jesus Christ you scared the shit out of me.
I wish that was all Miss Weathers, but there's more. The killer left a note.
I've tried to get in touch with Sidney Prescott, but she's keeping herself very well hidden. You're my one and only hope in finding her. Her life may be in grave danger.
I'd love to help, really I wouldn't mind being sliced at again by a maniacal psychopath, but I honestly don't know where Sidney is. After Windsor she dropped off the face of the Earth. The only other person that might know is, , not going to talk.
Shit. Sarah Darling.  I interviewed her too. God, it's happening again isn't it Detective?
I'm not at liberty to tell you that Miss Weathers. You're no longer working with the L.A.P.D. I don't even know why you're standing in here right now. By all means I should have you thrown out.
Four? There are five.
To me Hollywood is about death.
Nice to finally meet you, Sidney.
Sidney, do you have any idea how he could've gotten your number?
Jesus Christ Sidney, what happened? I got a call on my cell from home. They told me that someone was attacked.
I was afraid they were bait, something to, ya know,  trick you out of hiding.
Where are you Dewey?
Don't worry Sid I'd never leave you like that.
This has everything to do with me Dewey. I was the one who brought the nation's attention to this shit anyway. I'll be damned if I'm gonna sit around and pass on the buck again.
Do you really mean it this time Gale?
Yes. Look, let's get something straight Dewey, I got into this shit cause the police came looking for ME. Not cause I'm out to make the SUNRISE STUDIOS SLASHINGS.
Again, I am the author of the definitive book on the Woodsboro murders.!  What about you?
It didn't work Dewey.  We tried,  we're different.
All of what Dewey?  You do know something, don't you?
I already removed it.  I think someone on the film was trying to find Sid, and that's the only reason I came here. To make do a little private investigating of my own and make sure no one here was planning anything.
Gale, your engine's still running.
Thank you.
Oh.  Yeah, I guess I do.
It's a pleasure to finally meet you, Roman.
Would you excuse me for a moment?
AND I DIE NAKED?!  UGH! This is complete bullshit. Who wrote this piece of crap?
Who's phone?
Being Gale Weathers.  What the hell are you doing?
You know in the movies, I play you as being much smarter.
And as a sane person.  For you that must be quite a stretch.
Rob Reiner and Quentin Tarentino?
And now? I mean, murders on your set and still you say nothing?
Gale Weathers. What a surprise.
I think we should go inside. I have to have a talk with the cast. ALL OF YOU.
Well then the people you need to call are the police.
I was just asking. Why are you always at me?
Except for me and Billy... we were left for dead...
And then he killed you and then shoots himself in the head. It's a perfect ending.
What are you doing here?
I heard screaming. The door was locked. Are you okay...
No...
You lost your mom...
But this is life. This isn't a movie.
Or even a good porno.
Are you serious?
Jesus... fuck, that hurt.
Stop it!
You bitch -- where the fuck are you?
So why did you dial it again?
Why don't you want to talk to me?
You tell me your name, I'll tell you mine.
So, you gotta boyfriend?
Yes?
I swear it. And he's big and plays football and will beat the shit out of you.
I'm getting scared.
So you better leave.
Then he dies. Right now.
It's an easy category. Movie trivia.
...please...
You're not supposed to be here, ma'am.
No, not yet.
I'd love to. If you're sure it's alright?
I like it. It's... sexy.
Oh, God, Sid, I'm sorry I was late.
I know. We're checking every cellular account in the county. Any calls made to you or Casey Becker are being cross-referenced. It's gonna take time but we'll find him.
Have they found my father?
How is she?
Dewey! Where the hell you been, boy?
You think he could still be in town?
No, not so fast. We have nothing concrete.
What's the plan?
What's the delay?
About thirty seconds.
I want to talk to you.
And why would she do that?
Scary night, isn't it? With the murders and all, it's like right out of a horror movie or something.
Do you like scary movies, Sidney?
So who are you?
Poor Billy-boyfriend. An innocent guy doesn't stand a chance with you.
No you didn't.
You coming tonight?
You're such a little lap dog. He's got killer printed all over his forehead.
And what would be your motive?
I thought everything was checked out.
What's Leatherface doing here?
He came to make up.
If Tatum sees you -- she'll draw blood.
Guess, I won't be needing this anymore.
No prob. I'll pick you up after practice.
It's past seven.
During foreplay, I sing the theme song to myself. "Eight is enough to fill our lives with love..." It's a real turn on.
Is this not cool or what? Hey, Sid, what happened?
He's pissing in our faces again and we're just taking it.
Come on.  What are you going to do with yourself out there?
Can't you feel it yet?  Can't you feel that feeling... ?  You're not going to be a cop anymore.
I heard.
It's always been like this.
He's being arraigned tomorrow.
What the hell's going on?
What do you mean?
What makes you so special that people should pay attention?
You wouldn't because you know there are consequences.  It's in those eyes of yours, though... nothing wrong with a man taking pleasure in his work.  I won't deny my own personal desire to turn each sin against the sinner.  I only took their sins to logical conclusions.
Tell me what it was that gave me away. What was the piece of evidence you were going to use against me right before I walked up to YOU and put my hands in the air.
It's very simple.  You worked a nice, quiet town, but you fought to get here as if your life depended on it.  I've just never seen it done that way before, Detective.
It could be nothing.
The leather chair was soaked through with sweat.
Gould's wife.  She was away on business. If this means she saw anything, I don't know what.  We've questioned her at least five times.
Yeah.  Parts of them.  Anyway, in Purgatory, Dante and his buddy are climbing up that big mountain... seeing all these other guys who sinned...
Right.  But there, pride comes first, not gluttony.  The sins are in a different order.
Nothing.
Doesn't seem like our man, does it?
You tell me.  I'm new in town.
Yes.  They were there... so, it must be.
How did the fire fight end?
Oh, blah, blah, blah.  The guy's insane.
It's a fine line between insane and inspired.
No.  He's not depending on luck.  You've seen that.  We walked into that apartment exactly one year after he first tied Victor to the bed, to the day.  To the day! Because he wanted us to.
It's probably nothing, but even if it is, it's no skin off our teeth.  The man at Hot Dog World is a friend, in the Bureau.
For a long time, the F.B.I.'s been hooked into the library system, keeping accurate records.
What?  Assessing fines?
You got to be kidding.
The Writings of Saint Thomas Aqu... Aquin...
I'm fine.
It was him.
We need a warrant.
The irony is, after a day of the type of work he did, he'd come home and read me these morbid crime stories.  Murders in the Rue Morgue.  Le Fanu's Green Tea.  My mother would give him hell because he was keeping me up till all hours.
You know... there's not going to be a happy ending to this.  It's not possible anymore.
Don't try to focus on things as black and white, because you'll go blind.  There's no winning and losing here.
You think you're preparing me for the hard times ahead?  You think you're toughening me up?  Well, you're not!  You're quitting, fine... but I'm staying.
It wasn't one thing, if that's what you mean.  I just... I can't live here anymore. I can't live where stupidity is embraced and nurtured as if it were a virtue.
Well... what the fuck, man?
How long have you lived here?
I don't know, with this case.
I mean, you known this city.  You've been here for so long.
I can't be a burden, especially now.  I know I'll get used to things.  I guess I wanted to know what someone who's lived here thinks.  Upstate, it was a completely different environment.  I don't know if David told you, but I teach fifth grade, or did.
I've been going to some of the schools, looking for work, but the conditions here are... horrible.
Well, I got up one morning and went to work... just like any other day, except it was my first since hearing about the baby. And, I... I felt this fear and anxiety washing over me.  I looked around, and I thought, how can we raise a child surrounded by all this?  How can a child grow up here?  So, that night, I told her I didn't want us to have it, and over the next few weeks, I convinced her it was wrong.  I mean... I wore her down, slowly.
Why always like this?  Only after the fact... this sudden realization, that if you shoot someone, or stick a knife in them, that person will cease to exist.
This 'un come a long way 'fore he died.
Dunno...Seems so.
They're camped by the river -- 'bout twenty miles from here. Soon's it gets dark we'll circle out so's to jump 'em before day- break.
We can get within 500 yards...there's a hogback to the south.
Hold on, son...Who's this Colonel Greenhill you're talking about?
My pa wants to know...<U>Colonel</U> <U>Greenhill</U> wants to know how soon you could put a company of your Rangers in the field, fully armed and equipped, for joint punitive action against the Comanches.
I don't care what they've done to you...what happened...
Debbie, think back! I'm Martin... remember? Remember how I used to let you ride my horse? Tell you stories? Don't you remember me, Debbie?
Don't want no money, Ethan...jus' a place -- a roof over m' head...a little grub...a bunk to sleep in... an' a rockin' chair by the fire... my own rockin' chair by a fire...
Talk!
Don't forget to come back with my thousand dollars.
Why, sure, Ethan...There's just the one thing we're after...finding Deborah and Lucy...
Good night...Laurie...
She's your nothin'...She's no kin to you at all!
Martin...I want you to know some- thin'...
He just couldn't wait...
Let's go...I think I stumbled onto somethin'...
Nine...  Ten!
Never heard of him...
You figger Scar means to kill us?
Wait! We go chargin' in, they'll kill her...and you know it.
Well, you did all a body could, Ethan.
Every young man should at least once...Go on, Laurie! Read!
I gotta catch up with him, Laurie!
Don't cry, Laurie...I understand how it is...I'll just go 'way...
You crazy?
It's too late...She's a woman grown now...
I got to fetch her home...
I have to cut his windpipe...
You?
My father was an electrician. Already forgot that?
I have a funny feeling.  Do you think we'll get over all that's happened?
Maybe different.  I don't know, Ellen.
"Events commonly interpreted as haunting apparitions often result from psychic disharmonies or undigested traumatic ordeals..."
What?
She was old.
During the Middle Ages people were executed at every corner.  What's your point?
You know, Tommi wants me to become the man I used to be.
No, I've never seen him before.
Look at this.  The lock is totally demolished.
Romeo and Juliet--just a suggestion.
I am still owed money for this play, Burbage.
Are you writing?
Most interesting.
A woman of property?
Put his feet in.
Cut his nose off.
What's the title?
Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter.
My tailor. Wants to be an actor. I have a few debts here and there. Well, that seems to be everybody. Did you see a Romeo?
We are at least six men short, and those we have will be overparted, ranters and stutterers who should be sent back to the stews. My Romeo has let me down. I see disaster.
By God, I wish I knew.
Wonderful, wonderful.
I insist--and a beaker for Mr. Marlowe. The BARMAN does the business.
I have a new one nearly done, and better. The Massacre at Paris.
"Out."
"Of love?"
As a nurse.
From tomorrow, away in the country for three weeks! Is Master Shakespeare not handsome?
And--?
Your Majesty!
"…All my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay, And follow thee my lord throughout the world."
You left it in my bed. Come to look for it again.
Mr. Pope! Mr. Phillips! Welcome, George Bryan! James Armitage!  Sam! My pretty one! Are you ready to fall in love again?
But your voice  Have they dropped?
"What satisfaction can'st thou have tonight?"
Oh but why "alas?"
You can bring them with a word.
Wait! You are still a maid and perhaps as mistook in me as I was mistook in Thomas Kent.
Let him be damned for his pages!
To be the wife of a poor player?--can I wish that for Lady Viola, except in my dreams? And yet I would, if I were free to follow my desire in the harsh light of day.
You follow your desire freely enough in the night. So, if that is all, to Greenwich I go.
You were not dead before. When I thought you dead, I did not care about all the plays that will never come, only that I would never see your face. I saw our end, and it will come.
"Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day> It was the nightingale and not the lark That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear. Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree. Believe me, love, it was the nightingale."
But fearful of her virtue, she comes to him dressed as a boy
How does it?
Your father should keep you better informed. He has bought me for you. He returns from his estates to see us married two weeks from Saturday.  You are allowed to show your pleasure.
Bless me, I thought it was a horse.
Wait there.
And her lips?
Are you bringing your laundry woman?
What's his name?
All right, just a few questions.
Serve.
What do you think?
Yes or no, yes or no, yes or --
You think so?
I won't be able to.
Don't you worry about that.
Is this necessary?
Now.
Good luck. I love that guy, but why does he have to follow us around?
I'm glad you're so certain, Alex. It makes us feel a whole lot better.
So I gathered.
Well?
It looks like he's writing everything down.
Right.
Yes. It is, isn't it? We alllike it. And the room's nice too, don't you think?
Well, yes.
God, you two are sensitive. All I'm doing is implying some sort of sordid, ugly, sexual liason. Why, I'd be proud of that sort of thing.
For the flat.
She hated you --
It was you, Juliet, it was you --
David hasn't seen him either.
Alex, how shouldI know? I'm just a girl.
It's not every day I find a story in my own flat.
I thought we all were.
But you're a doctor. You kill people every day.
Whoever draws the short straw does it all. That way, you either do it or you don't. All or nothing.
Sshh.
Love and happiness for ever.
No.
No, but he's looking after the money, so what's the problem?
David?
Exactly. Now I've been thinking --
No.
I refuse.
Everything. Except maybe that it was his idea and not mine in the first place. OK? That's important to me. I need to die misunderstood.
Alex.
It makes us feel a whole lot better.
It's about the burglary.
How strange. And how unsatisfactory to have misleading information. Only three people here. You're sure?
Loks like you had a break-in up here as well.
You're sure of that.
Why do you want a room here?
What do we do here, David?
And that's why I think you fit in here.
I'm boring?
Oh, I see, I thought you meant --
Hello.
It's nice.
No.
No. But he needs treatment.
Yes, the first one's fine. Heathrow direct.
Diseases.
Chicken salad.
What're you talking about, George?
Maybe he's just a kooky guy who likes doing something kooky like that.
-- yes, Senator -- just a minute, dear --
Does she have a pancreatic ulcer?
Ruth Lesserman had a pancreatic ulcer.
She did?
So what are you doing going over there? You're not her doctor.
You're very rude... if you don't come back --
I'll be back in a while.
-- I like myself far too much, far too much.
George --
What kind of treatment?
I wouldn't say so if I didn't.
And I certainly wouldn't tell Lester.
She's a friend of Jill's.
Holy Christ. You want to get us killed?
Are you in love with her?
Then it's not your problem.
It isn't?
I guess so.
Yeah.
C'mon, are you or aren't you?
Why do you wanna know so bad?
... just, you could look very heavy...
Yeah, it is.
In fact, I don't think I've ever been to a beauty parlor in my whole life.
You think that's funny, don't you?
Right.
After all, Mr. Roundy, we're paying six percent. Six percent. FHA's at eight and a half -- no, we won't be going back to the old days.
Yeah.
You promised you'd do the show.
Jesus...
Jill's coming with us.
It's the sauna, I keep the sauna on and it makes the whole bathroom hot.
Did I what?
You know what I'm talking about.
Baby...
Yeah, baby...
-- oh yeah... what do you know about this guy?
Jesus Christ, there's Norma Stern. Look at her hair.
-- Just get me out of here, baby. I can't stand it. It's killing me.
-- yeah.
You're going to kill me.
Well then what are you trying to do-
If you knew how many times I wanted to hear you say that...
So I'm saying it...
What's that supposed to mean?
I've got to... I've got to tell him where I am.
Do you know what that Lillian Bercovici just did?
What?
You were supposed to handle that bitch, she's always asking for you, and she was furious you weren't here.
She's murdered her hair... you do something with her, I'm never going to touch her again.
Jackie Shawn.
-- yes, George.
Nothing, my sister's back from Vegas.
Who?
George --
Not right now, I don't mean right now... but eventually...
Go where?
Hey, baby, say hello to Felicia.
I already said hello.
When is that, George?
Where's your car?
I don't want to fight either. Look... uh -- I love you.
What is.
Didn't you, baby?
Yes.
Yes.
Well, did you get a job out of it at least?
... honest. At least you're honest with me.
Did you?
Did you?
Well anyway...
Look, Lester... are you unhappy with me about something?
Now wait a minute...
I'm not anti-Establishment.
You don't have a clean glass in the house.
Oh yeah...
What about her?
I mean, how did that happen?
No --
Just a whore, I go over there, have a few drinks and get my gun off. I'm through with her, she's nothing but a whore.

I'll call you back...
A soap?
Sid. You must be a very important executive.
Is that right?
Steve Slutes, and he's not a boy.  Steve couldn't get arrested as an actor. He couldn't get arrested as a boy.
I'm always on the phone because you never let me see anybody, I can't even bring my girlfriends over to the house because they might run into you. You're driving me up the wall, Lester. You're even jealous of the dogs. I mean I've gotta have somebody I can talk to.
You and your touchy investors.
I'd like a drink.
Jackie Shawn.
Who is that?
Face it, you can go around with cute guys and get hung up on their sexy bodies and things like that but sooner or later you've got to find somebody. Face it, time isn't on your side.
After four years? No I don't... and I don't know too many girls who do.
I'm exaggerating.
Jackie --
Quite a while... an hour, an hour and a half -- sometimes forty-five minutes -- that's quite a while, isn't It?
-- uhh-huhh...
-- He reached up and tore them.
That's right.
-- no.
Getting your hair done...  Would you like to go to a party?
-- why?
Those Arabs won't be when they start chasing you around the sand dunes.
Where to, Les?
Yes, Dad.
Yes?
Yes I do.  I love it.  Don't you?
Yes, Dad.
Tony.
Tony's the little boy who lives in my mouth.
No, I'm scared of nothing here. It's just that you know some places are like people, some shine and some don't.  I guess you could say the Overlook Hotel here has something about it that's like shining.
Okay, Mom.
Okay Danny, you win.  Let's take the rest of this walking, huh?
I didn't think it was going to be this big, did you?
Yes?
Well all right.  But really don't make a sound.
if you were to open your mouth now, could I see Tony?
Advocaat is it?
haven't I seen you somewhere before?
A nigger.
How?
Your son has a very great talent. I don't think you are aware how great it is, but he is attempting to use that very talent against your will.
No need to rub it in, Mr. Grady. I'll deal with that situation as soon as I get out of here.
Sure.
The Torrances are going to take care of the Overlook for us this winter.
Pleased to meet you.
How's my credit in this joint anyway?
No charge?
I'm the kind of man likes to know who's buying their drinks, Lloyd.
Good Morning, hon.  Your breakfast is ready.
I had... I had the most terrible nightmare I ever had.  It's the most horrible dream I ever had.
Well I... I think maybe he should be taken to a doctor.
I just want to go back to my room.
Wendy!
Stop swinging the bat.
Jack, stay away from me!
Stop swinging the bat.
Give me the bat.
I'll bring back a doctor.
Mr. Ullman?
Yes?
Only in a very general way.
five months of peace is just what I want.
I don't believe they did.
Well, obviously some people can be
Fine.
What time does the plane leave?
Eight thirty.
Yes. Go away.
It isn't enough that the monster killed all those people- that he killed Brady. Now he's got them to cancel the fair.
Yeah, okay, the fireworks. Jane thinks that's all I'm mad about, but it's not. Them doing that is just a... a...
Yeah, Winesburg, Ohio, was never like that... but I got something that just might cheer you up.
Do I need one?
It came for me! I shot it in the eye! Now he's wearing an eye-patch!
There! You see!
I come here because Marty needs a friend.
Yeah.  Sister Mary Pat was discussing it.  You know she thinks it's a sin.
LET THY SPIRIT
SING!
Hey, Sisters.  Are you going in there?
I want us to be together.  Like people. Honest, decent people.  In the eyes of God.  Babe, today... I went to confession.
For the first time in I don't know how long.  I wanted everything done right. Open and above board.  I told Father Antonelli I was in love.  I told him it was a special love, for all the ages.
Thanks.  A lot.
What, Vincent?  This is me, doll.  I know you.  What did you think you were doing?  Running to the cops.  Hiding out. No, no.  You're sorry now, aren't you?
I was good to you! You re nothing but no-talent garbage! You're a two-bit Tramp!
Yes, Betty?
To sell, of course.  I hate to say it, but we're in terrible trouble here at St. Katherine's.  We need a new roof, the furnace is going, and there's no money.
The Dixie Cups?  Oh my.  I was just a girl.  Of course.  SPRING IS HERE THE SUN WILL SHINE
Jackpot!  Two buckets
What a shame!
What?
Amateurs 2
Three years.  A rookie.
I have to do this.  So I can become a nun.
Oh my Lord!
What?
Run!  Take off!
Parochial school.  Akron.  St. Android's.
You see?  You see?  I have to get out of here   I have to make a phone call. Don't you get  it?  I'm in a convent! You're a nun!
Cool.  Is there a menu?  Or buffet?
A what?
Useless distractions.
I'm sure.  If I were you, I would use this time, to think about my life.  And its direction.  Or lack thereof.
Girls, this is Sister Mary Clarence. She'll be minding you until Sister Mary Patrick's return.  Mary Clarence, please assign a biblical passage.  Do not attempt discussion.  Am I understood?
It never solves anything.
So... hi there.
I know!  I'm sorry   I didn't mean for it to happen!  And I was the one they were shooting at!
You will sing, and you will sleep,' that is your schedule until you depart.  As almost no one attends Mass, you will be unable to cause further damage.
No.  No.
Through blasphemy?  You have corrupted the entire choir!
I believe this can be settled by a simple vote.
Really.  Well, that makes two of us.
Okay, so I just got things started.  But you could build on that.  You could keep it going.
I am sorry, Mary Clarence.  I seem to have misplaced my tambourine.  Good day, Mary Clarence.
But...
I don't know anything about bodies!  I mean, he didn't bring it home.  He was good to me... sometimes.  He was sweet. He took care of me.  Who am I supposed to go out with?  He owns a casino.  He let me sing.
Jesus, what do you think this is -- Wheel of Fortune?  Let me spell it out for you.  You have to hide like you don't even exist.  You have to get so far hidden away that you never see sunlight.
It's a convent.  All you have to do is shut up, behave yourself, and get along.
Everywhere but this little hole-in-the- wall convent.  Nobody knows you're here but me.  We're trying to get a quick court date.  A month, maybe two, tops. I'll spring you as soon as I can.
Eddie, you've got to get me out of here.
Do you hear that?  That choir?  Eddie, in here, that's what they call music!
Does she know people are trying to kill me out there?
Eddie!  You scared the hell out of me!
I really can't talk about it now.  The place is packed.  SRO.  I've got a show to do.
Listen to yourself.  This isn't a career opportunity.
Yeah.  You look... great.  I mean it..
Really?  Lieutenant?
You mean -- worried about my testimony?
I have?
What're you doing?
Oh-huh.
Vince -- is she... okay?
It didn't work, Vince.
I figured if you were gonna, then I wouldn't have to.
We sound terrible   We need Mary Clarence.
Bless her!  There are so many problems in this neighborhood that we could help solve.  That's why many of us became nuns.  It's marvelous, Reverend Mother.
I don't understand.  Where is she?
Calm down.  Think clearly.  Mary Robert, do you have any idea who those men were?
Las Vegas -- she's here somewhere.
It's that call you were expecting, Vince.
And who are you to talk?  You were nothing.  You couldn't even sing.  I must have been out of my mind.
We both missed.
We haven't heard your name yet, friend.
They spend two days in chains.
You must have missed your mark.
Excuse me?
What?
It is sacrilege!
Your superiors are two days away!
For poaching.  Or, would you remake our laws now that Magistrate Philipse has given up the ghost?
Oh?  Far as I can tell, a rumor does not travel alone for long here.
It is only important what you are. An adulterer...
I have everything... last testaments... birth certificates, death certificates... deeds.
Not for lack of trying.
Not more than a year ago, a mob hung a man for stealing a horse.  For stealing a horse!  And, you dig up our dead.
I'm sure I don't know.
How could he?
What is it?
I hear nothing.
We are leaving.
We should go.
And it now belongs to you, according to Baltus.  I heard him say it.
Did your father take a loan?
Something I really wish I had not seen. Never mind it.  Did you find the victims' loan agreements?
It is nothing.  She comes to read books, so her father will not find her.  It is absolutely nothing.
Won't you change your mind, sir? What can I say to convince you?
Not all think it is the Horseman. Many say witches come from the Western Woods to steal skulls for their cauldrons.  Some believe a person in this very town kneels before Lucifer, offering death as tribute.  And, still others believe none of it.
And this gives worth to butchery?
Take a lesson from Young Masbath's desires, Ichabod Crane.  He follows with you to avenge his father's death. That I understand.  But, what do you want?
You falter with your answer because you strive without putting the whole of your heart into it.  Can't you see? You'll bring dignity to the dead even if you have to chop them into little pieces to do it.
Why is it every grave I open holds a new mystery inside?
I have not been able to face him yet.
Where are we going?
The church.
Returning to the Western Woods?
Where?
He rides tonight.
That boy wants me to.
He won't steal. I'm tellin' you he's a pretty good ol' boy. Keeps to himself.
I'll see you, Bill.
Sixty for small and seventy-five for large.
You sure are hung up on people bein' sweet.  Speakin' of which, where's your girlfriend? I thought he was comin' by here for something.
He'll be here in a little while, he's takin' me to get an ice cream.
Have a damn party! Call Morris and them and get the band together and just party our asses off. I'd like to show that fuckin' Karl to the guys. They'd get a kick out of that. Don't you know they would.
You know what I told you, you even think of leavin' me, I'll kill you dead as a doornail.
Don't tell me what to do.
What in the goddamn hell are you doin'? It's the middle of the night.
We'll go to church and get you baptized, tomorrow's Sunday. You go on back to bed.
Last time you got mad and run Morris and them off and said to stay away from here.
Hey, Vaughan, you know what I heard? I heard you been puttin' it to Albert Sellers that works over at the funeral home.
What's all them books?
On the bass, give it up for Terence "One Ball" Atkins.  On the tambourine and lyrics Morris Hobbs the fuckin' genius of the group.  On drums "The Johnson."  And last and most importantly, Doyle Hargraves on rhythm guitar and business affairs and the only motherfucker with a truck big enough to haul this outfit on the next world fuckin' tour. Come on, a big hand for these guys. They're workin' their asses off here.  Okay I'd like to dedicate this next one to some very special people in our audience tonight. To my lovely female companion Linda, her lovely son Frank, our new boarder Karl - what's your last name Karl?
Pick up the fuckin' phone and call 'em, I guess.
Are you well?
Yeah. What you doin' by here?
Aw, come on. You'll like her. She's real nice. She'll give us somethin' if we ask her to. Candy or somethin'.
You don't need to know all of that. You're just a boy. You need to think about good thoughts while you're still a boy. They'll be plenty of time for the other.
Were they bad people?
Maybe they needed it.
All right then.
Hit was right thoughty of her.
I was wantin' to ask you somethin'.
You know that girl I told you about. The one I love.
Yes sir. You ort not know that language.
He ain't no count.
Why not? It died?
It was still alive when you buried it?
Readin' on this book on how to work carpentry. I aim to learn how to build things out of wood one of these times. I've always been partial to wood buildin's and cabinets and whatnot. These drawin's they got here don't make no sense to me so far.  You seem like yore tails a'draggin' a might. You got somethin' wrong with ye?
I don't reckon I know. I ain't found no way yet and I'm three or four times as old as you. Might be that's just the way folks is.
Just diggin'.  I ain't ever gonna be happy now. Not with that son of a bitch movin' in for good. I wish me and you and Mama could just run away. But she said he would find us wherever we went. He's crazy. Sometimes I think it would of been better if I wadn't ever born.
You have to Karl. You have to look out for me. You don't let that son of a bitch run you off.
I care for you, too. But you'll be around, don't say that.
You don't want to give away all your books.
I've got a feelin' today.
Okay. I give you my word. Is ever'thing gonna be okay? Are you all right?
Yeah, he has to go to work in a little while. I do too.
Did Karl go to bed?
I ain't got nothing but them books.
I want to come back and stay here.
I reckon I don't care nothin' about bein' a free man. I don't know how to go about it.
Naw. Never did know too much of nobody. Not to he'p me out anyway.
I know, I've seen it myself. Would you give that a try?
Do they know about you?
Tolerable, I reckon.
I didn't aim to.
Right now?
It's all right.  You know I was thinkin' there's this girl that works with me. She's real heavy, but she's cute in the face. Well, you know, she's slow. She's a little bit, I think. She's not retarded, just -- it don't matter, listen to me. I thought you might like to meet her. Vaughan wants to have a little supper over at his house and we could invite her. Would you like that?
Vaughan's "friend" will be there, too. He works at the funeral home. And Frank. You know Frank likes you a lot. He says you make him feel calm.
Yes ma'am.  I like your garage.  I wouldn't never hurt you or your boy. I'd lay my hand on the Bible and say the same thing.
Is that right?  Are you going to be staying here long?
I done et just a little bit ago.
I mean tomorrow or the next day.
I reckon I can stand to eat a little somethin' or 'nother at noontime tomorrow. Bill Cox generally gets me a box of french fried potaters. But I reckon he can lay off doin' it tomorrow.
Not funny, ha, ha, funny queer.
What about me?
Do you smell shit?
I knew he slept in a toolshed.
His mother told him that he was their punishment. Hers and his father's; from God, for having sex--
Will he be supervised?
You mean about y'all bein' together in "that" way?
Perhaps I should rephrase the question. What I mean to say is, are you married or seriously involved with a significant other?
Three's a crowd. Yes, I'm aware of that. But I have to keep an eye on Mr. Benjamin wherever he goes. To make sure he doesn't get himself into trouble.
Better make it charge. 
Until she was twelve. She moved here in 'forty-nine.
I'll tell you all about it...  ... but not here.
Next time, when you want two corned beef sandwiches, say, "Two corned beef sandwiches." When you want two ginger ales, say, "Two ginger ales."
Hey, Auggie. How's it going?
Two tins of Schimmelpennincks. And throw in a lighter while you're at it.
Slow down, huh?
Hey, Auggie, I've just been thinking. You wouldn't need some help around the store, would you? Some summer help while Vinnie's gone?
I'm thinking about the kid. I'm sure he'd do a good job for you.
No. The ... uh ... the Bobbsey Twins lit out when they heard the sirens. But at least they stopped playing that marimba duet on my skull.  Assaultus interruptus.
I spoke to his aunt a couple of days ago, but she hasn't heard from him either. It's beginning to get a little scary.
Nice machine, Auggie. Where'd you find it?
Fine.  Or it was until a couple of days ago. A guy from The New York Times called and asked me to write a Christmas story. They want to publish it on Christmas Day.
Okay.  You remember how you once asked me how I started taking pictures? Well, this is the story of how I got my first camera. As a matter of fact, it's the only camera I've ever had. Are you following me so far?
She probably died.
I've got something to talk to you about, and the least you can do is listen. You owe me that much. I drove all the way from Pittsburgh to see you, and I'm not going until you've heard me out.
Don't look at me like that. Auggie. It gives me the creeps.
It means "happiness."
I know what it means. That still don't make it a good name.
It was over with Bill before you ever came home. Maybe you don't remember it now, but you were pretty hot to see me back then.
Who the hell knows?  He dropped out of sight fifteen years ago.
Just get in and shut up. I'm not asking you to do anything. I just need you to come with me.
There's just one thing I want to know.
You don't take anything seriously, do you?
Tobacco today, sex tomorrow. In three or four years, it'll probably be against the law to smile at strangers.
Speaking of which, are you still going ahead with that deal on the Montecristos?
For me? And what am I supposed to do with a paper bag?
What is this, some kind of joke?
And how much are these?
Any time. And congratulations to you and your wife. Just remember, though, in the immortal words of Rudyard Kipling: "A woman is just a woman, but a cigar is a smoke.
Don't give me any of that. I know he's been here. You can't fool me, mister.
You mean Rashid?
Rashid? Rashid! Is that what he told you his name was?
I shouldn't have let him go.
No thank you.
And you told your nephew about it?
His father walked out on his mother a couple of months after he was born. Louisa was Henry's younger sister, and she and the baby moved in with us. Four or five years go by, and then one day Cyrus shows up out of the blue, tail between his legs, wanting to patch things up with Louisa. I thought Henry was going to tear Cyrus apart when he saw him walk through the door. They're both big men, those two, and if they ever started to tangle, you'd see some teeth jumping on the floor. I guarantee it ... So Cyrus persuaded Louisa to go out with him to talk things over in quiet. And the poor girl never came back.
You mean she just ran off with him and left her little boy behind?
I don't know what you look like, boy. As far as I can tell, you sprouted up like a mushroom in this spot last night.  You live in this town -- or on your way from here to there?
Not a one. Not one customer all day. I bought this broken-down shit-hole of a place three weeks ago, and if business don't pick up soon, I'm going straight down the skids. What do I want to be hiring someone for? I can't even pay my own wages.
Is there a benefits package, or are you hiring me on a freelance basis?
An ugly piece of hardware, isn't it?  I'll tell you what happened to my arm.  I'll tell you what happened.  Twelve years ago, God looked down on me and said, "Cyrus, you're a bad, stupid, selfish man. First of all, I'm going to fill your body with spirits, and then I'm going to put you behind the wheel of a car, and then I'm going to make you crash that car and kill the woman who loves you. But you, Cyrus, I'm going to let you live, because living is a lot worse than death. And just so you don't forget what you did to that poor girl, I'm going to rip off your arm and replace it with a hook. If I wanted to, I could rip off both your arms and both your legs, but I'm going to be merciful and just take off your left arm. Every time you look at your hook, I want you to remember what a bad, stupid, selfish man you are. Let that be a lesson to you, Cyrus, a warning to mend your ways."
And this one, in case you haven't guessed, is Junior.
Of course there's gonna be a war. You think they'd send five hundred thousand troops over there just to lie in the sun? I mean, there's plenty of beach, but not a hell of a lot of water. Half a million soldiers. It ain't no seaside holiday, you can bet on that.
So what's the time?
Watch out, man. You'll get yourself killed like that.
Yes it is. It's a law of the universe. If I let you walk away, the moon will spin out of orbit ... pestilence will reign over the city for a hundred years.
You don't know me from a hole in the wall.
That's where the what comes in.
My father did. Believe it or not, that little baby is me.
He's dead?
I'm a teenager. All teenagers are clumsy. It's because we're still growing. We don't know where our bodies end and the world begins.
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry... I was trying to reach for one of the books up there ...  And then, I don't know, the sky fell on top of me.
It just won't do, will it? I go two and a half years without being able to write a word, and then, when I finally get started on something, when it looks as though I might actually be coming to life again, you show up and start breaking everything in my house. It just won't do, will it?
Absolutely. The world is my oyster.  Whatever that means. 
Not a penny, not a stitch. I'm cool, man. 
I bought it. Twenty-nine ninety-five on sale at Goldbaum's TV and Radio.  Well, that just about takes care of it, I guess. You'll be able to watch the ball games. You know, as a little break from your work. 
Okay, okay.  It's all so stupid.  There's this guy, see. Charles Clemm. The Creeper, that's what people call him. The kind of guy you don't want to cross paths with.
And?
If I tell you, I might not be able to finish it.
Uh, actually, I tend to shy away from that kind of thing.
No way. There's no way I'm giving that money back. It's my money now.
So you lost the job. Is that what you're telling me? He just up and fired you?
It was more complicated than that. There was a reason.
Fries?
I am a bastard.  I'm a big Hun Nazi son of a bitch.  And I still got your bamboo fishing rod.
With no bone or scalp or hair present.  Would it be more probable that the blood came from crushing a man's skull...
That he'd keep an eye on Miyamoto. Watch out for him.
Second question.  What did Ole Jurgensen pay you per acre?
Well, what if?
We hear how Carl...passed away. Only a few hours later.
Closer to eight.
Yes, and then, what was there to call about?  Everything was up in the air.
I told myself that was good.  That it made our friendship special.  And didn't mean she was ashamed of it. Necessarily.
Your friends would.  Your dad would kill me with a machete.
There can't be any wrong in this, Ha...
My father can't get our money from the bank.  We have a few dol...
And you were generally experienced in training men for hand-to-hand combat.
Well, I was a doctor in the Jap theater, in the war.  I saw those kendo wounds, <u>many</u> times.  Looked exactly like this one.
Sheriff said right off, I was under suspicion.  I didn't have a lawyer...
How long you have this detail?
You mean, early morning the 16th?
If I whistle.  Those boys'll see you, and come runnin'.  <u>You're</u> the story today.
What for, Sheriff?
Now I did some measuring down at the chandlery.  A D-6 is one inch wider than a D-8.  It would be too large for the deceased's well.
So the defendant went out fishing for the night with <u>no</u> spare battery, hmmn?
Apparently.
And her farmhouse...?
Is it possible?
Sure, anything's poss...
Why?
I beg your pardon.
You girls have seen a brown bag with a white stripe and my initials?
Those two musicians from the garage!
It's just a little inlay - it doesn't even have to be gold -
No we're not.
But suppose it doesn't?
Where are we running, Joe?
As far away as possible.
Shave?  At a time like this?  Those guys got machine guns - they're going to blast our heads off - and you want to shave?
How can they walk on these things? How do they keep their balance?
I feel so naked.  Like everybody's looking at me.
Men?
What are you doing?
Fight it.
It's not my fault.  I didn't invite them.
Male and female - the moth and the flame - I ought to slug you!
And I'm not even pretty.
Listen, stupid - right now Spats Colombo and his chums are looking for us in every male band in the country.
What are you talking about?  Sugar and me, we're just like sisters.
He's not only got a yacht, he's got a bicycle.
Wise guy, huh?  Trying to louse me up -
I'm engaged.
WHAT?
Security.
I'll say there is!
We've been discussing that.  He wants to go to the Riviera - but I sort of lean toward Niagara Falls.
Joe -
We can't just walk out on her without saying goodbye.
What did we do?  Joe, you're not pulling one of your old tricks.
Good night, Sugar.
And your head is hot.
What did you say?
I'm a very sick girl.
Who needs vermouth?
But there's one thing I envy you for.
What's that?
Will she be surprised. I just can't wait to see her face -
Do you suppose she went out shopping?
No!
I'm not surprised.
So this year, when George White's Scandals opened, she packed me off to Florida.  Right now she thinks I'm out there on my yacht - deep-sea fishing.
If I promise not to be a naughty boy - how about dinner tonight?
Sorry.  I'll be on the bandstand.
You must be quite a girl.
Well, I'll be - !  He does have a bicycle.
They got a Cuban band that's the berries. Why don't we go there - blindfold the orchestra - and tango till dawn?
You're leading again.
And I have a terrible past.  For three years now, I've been living with a saxophone player.
I forgive you.
We'll adopt some.
Anything today?
Yes, Joe.
Hey, Sig - can we talk to you?
No, we couldn't!
Look, if you boys want to pick up a little money tonight -  At the University of Illinois they are having - you should excuse the expression - a St. Valentine's dance.
Well, here we are.
We got it second-hand.
On the Baltimore and Ohio.
No, just dumb.  If I had any brains, I wouldn't be on this crummy train with this crummy girls' band.
Yeah.  With money like Rockefeller, and shoulders like Johnny Weismuller -
Would you mind terribly?
Saxophone player?
What makes you so sure?
That must be it.
Which one is yours - the big one?
I'm not interested at all.
So do I.  as a matter of fact, I spent three years at the Sheboygan Conservatory of Music.
They do indeed.  Daddy threatened to cut me off without a cent, but I don't care. It was such a bore - coming-out parties, cotillions -
- riding to hounds -
Why?
Shell Oil?
And you will come to hear us tonight?
One of whom?
Shell Oil, Junior.  He's got millions - he's got glasses - and he's got a yacht.
Been waiting long?
Thank you.  And thank you for the flowers.
I seem to be out of gas.
It looked so small from the beach - but when you're on it, it's more like a cruiser - or a destroyer.
I don't mind if I do.
Water polo - isn't that terribly dangerous?
What thing?
You mean you can't fall in love?
Well, it was my freshman year at Princeton - there was this girl - her name was Nellie - her father was vice-president of Hupmobile - she wore glasses, too.  That summer we spent our vacation at the Grand Canyon - we were standing on the highest ledge, watching the sunset - suddenly we had an impulse to kiss - I took off my glasses - I took a step toward her - she took a step toward me -
Ever since then -  numb - no feelings.  Like my heart was shot full of novocaine.
Maybe if you saw a good doctor...
Really?
I'm afraid not.  I can't make it tonight.
A merger?  How long will you be gone?
Sugar!  What do you think you're doing?
I know.  Every time!
Where are they holding the wake? I'm supposed to be one of the pallbearers.
What'll it be, sir?
Booze.
Okay, Spats - the services are over. Lets go.
I heard you opera-lovers were having a little rally - so I thought I better be around in case anybody decides to sing.
Me?  I was at Rigoletto.
Spats Colombo.
I come to Grandma's funeral.  Here's your admission card.
Thanks, Charlie.
There’s finally a reason for the whole world to revolve around you?
Fred Astaire and what’s her face!
Where’s Nick sleeping?
Why, with you.
Huh?
I blame Tony Pee-Pants!
Before Tony, you and your sister were best friends. I couldn’t split you up. If your sister ate the spinach, you ate the spinach. If you threw up--.
Um, just about everyone.
I’ll just check into a hotel.
What?
Other than, he’s shagging your exgirlfriend?
No.
But, somehow, it was Kat’s arse that was stung by nettles. And you rubbed it with a dandelion leaf.
Why, Jeffrey. Hello.
Hey, you!
That was a long time ago.
You know, they say you can tell everything you need to know about a person from the way they act when they’re naked.
No, count it, anyway.
Who are they?
A weekend?
Sorry. I’m a little nervous. I never thought something like this would happen to me.
Of course not. How...how could it be? Nothing happened.
Oh, cut the crap!
So, why’d you say yes to me?
You have more than one gynecologist?
You didn’t have to do that.
Hey, Sal.
You want me to let him in?
So why’d you let him go?
Yeah.
Hey, Sigmund, you think you could rustle up the bride and tell her to join the party?
Did your mother know you were going to see your father?
Colored.
Oh... . You right, that's all that was worryin' me right then...
Yes, sir...
You learnin' anything at that school?
Hi, Daddy...
I don't know, son -- they won't tell us things like that -- but I don't want y'all to come here no more.
Where's everybody?
Dear David, if you are coming to school here, be sure to bring some warm clothes. The school term will begin September 8th, but it would be good for you to be here by the 4th or 5th of the month. I do hope everything is fine and you will be here. Give my "hello" to your family. Yours truly, Miss Camille Johnson...
You just came back home, Daddy. I don't wanna leave right now -- I wanna stay home and be with you.
Do you know my daddy, Nathan Lee Morgan?
Yes, David...
See you tomorrow, Miss Boatwright.
David Lee, it's time for you to get to bed!
That's right!
Can I go when the holiday comes?
Poor creature...
Can't sleep?
No, ma'am...  Mama, I wanted Mrs. Boatwright to find out where Daddy is, so me and Sounder can go see him.
What's wrong with him, David?
Don't pout now, David, it's a long trip.
What did the Lord tell you, Ike?
Hi ya doin' there, Ike?
Whatcha got there?
Mama, when kin me and Earl go to school with David Lee?
Dammit, I'm talkin' to you, woman! I gotta farm to think about and I need answers.
It's not that simple, Sister Rebecca -- the Lord works in mysterious ways -- we come into this life with nothin' and we'll leave it with nothing.
Shore thing -- next week sometime, and as soon as I git the day, I'll ride out and let you know 'bout it.
Behold my glory.
There are more important matters right now...
Fuckin' a right.
But you guys... It's Salisbury steak.
Dude, this is seriously lame. I didn't know we were gonna get all dirty and stuff.
Cartman, over zere, is the electrical box. You must sneak over zere and shut it off before I return with Terrance and Phillip or the alarms will sound and I will be shot full of holes. Got it?
Dude, how can you hate the environment?
Your behind?
Eric!  Don't talk to Ms. Brovlofski that way!
I don't know honey. Soon we hope. You want it to end quickly, huh?
Mom...
Thank God, that sucked ass.
Chef, what does it mean that we're at war?
Him? I don't know... He can be nice... sometimes.
Mph rmph rm rmph rmph rm!
What's that?
YOU GOTTA BE FUCKING KIDDING ME!!
Uhh... Bacon.
Do you see them?  Do you see Terrance and Phillip?
Woa, dude, who's your girlfriend's new guy?
Now remember, don't tell anybody we saw the Terrance and Phillip movie!
Dude, our moms arrested Terrance and Phillip!
This is sweet!!
Stan!
As Commander in chief, I have ordered our Army to set up defensive positions along the US-Canada border in anticipation of an attack.
Huh?
You're all part of Satan's army now!
What is Terrance and Phillip?
Terrance and Phillip are two VERY untalented, unfunny actors from Canada. Their TV show is filled with toilet humor and bad language and is just complete garbage.  Now it appears they have a movie and I'm positive it's not suitable for children!
Well, some of the children just don't respond to 12 step programs.
HA HA HA! You burned yourself to death by lighting the fart! HA HA HA!!
Hello, Conan!
You don't care.
Now do what I say and keep your fucking mouth shut!
Wendy?
Sure, Stan! How did you know I loved ice cream?
<b>Thank my lucky stars Here before me now Is everything I'd ever hoped for-</b>
Excuse me?
Well, it was nice meeting you. Enjoy the rest of the trip.
Why should she, it's her fault. All guests are told not to eat in zero gravity, but she just wanted to have fun I guess, didn't realize what a grain of salt can do to sophisticated machinery.
Well I guess there's no time like the present.  I'll go run a check on that room, just to show we go that extra mile for our guests.
You want to go back to shuttle work?
Why yes Ryan, I am, and thanks for asking.  You don't have to talk to the intercom, I can hear you fine.
Seems like they're cooperating. Hopefully I'll be out of here and on my way very soon.
Goddamn it Barnes this really steams my onions!
Is that clear?
Like that piece of ass he was with.
Like open an airlock by mistake?
Probably come through the wall I suppose.
Can't we access the mainframe to check the ship's condition?
Yeah?
Don't worry about what will happen, just concentrate on what is happening.  You'll live longer.
What's that?
A little dab'll do ya. Now you know how to get there, right?
I'm about to blow the wall.
I'll do my best.
Thanks for everything, Taylor. Will I see you again?
Thank you.
Is there anything I can help you with?
We should have gone to Nassau. At least we could go swimming, lie on the beach.
You're Delbert Miles!  You have more clout than some whacked out pilot!  Talk to him!
Yeah but the ship's mainframe doesn't. I need you to tell it something.
Now Mac, can you tell me the status of this deck?
Is it safe for human transport?
You're not from around here, are you?
Hey, cut it out Sid, that tickles. I'm serious! You guys are related, right?
But not no more. Now people take advantage. Bowling ain't what it used to be. There's something evil spreading in this sport - like a big, gigantic, puss- ridden -
- canker sore.
How do you turn this thing off?
Miles, I've always been on the square with you.
I got suspended when I was young, too. I was pretty cocky in my day.
What do you think I can do?
That game was before you was born.
What are you doing over at the lanes that's so dangerous, Buzz?
Theo.
Don't say that about my mom!
Theo, I want you to get out of this town.
I'm getting to like it here.
That's right, Buzz, and you know when I did it? Last match, last frame. All I needed was one spare for the crown - and I get stuck with the seven-ten, the Fazeli Split.
I told you to get lost. You forced yourself into this mess, so the mess accommodated you. Buzz straightens out and carefully remolds the bent out of shape halo.
Thanks, kid.  Where are you goin' now?
He's not the guy, Millie. Just whip the whips.
Mom, you know I had to do it. I just did it a little too late.
It depends.
You played bouncy-bouncy with Sheila, so I'm gonna play Blue-Face with you. 
Weird, comes into alleys and doesn't bowl.
Buzz has been moving the cash out in hollow bowling pins. Sid and Breeze throw sideways glances at each other.
So you're Buzz's boy. I've been expecting you. You hurt my feelings when you didn't come and see me sooner.
You know who I am?
You already have a partner Mr. Kastle. Sheila walks over as the sleazeballs' car pulls out of the driveway.
You're just like you mother! Always jealous!
That's why Mom ran away, because you had to control everything!
I'm a bowler.
Careful with that one. He won't tell me anything, but I know there's something strange going on over at the lanes. If you ask me, I'd say the old fart wants to die.
Where can I find him?
Do those two work for your dad or mine?
Where did your brother escape from?
The mental hospital.
What does he do?
Can I ask you something personal?
Nobody in this town really understands Junior. When I went to family sessions for him I realized he was the sanest one in the family. Actually, he's the only one in this whole fucking town who knows exactly who he is and what he wants.
No, I'm fascinated.
I used to be kind of wild. They used to call me the bad boy of bowling.
Well, that was plan A.
He said he'd sponsor me.
I may not be a pro bowler, but I'm no amateur man. Sheila moves closer to Theo.
No, but something's gonna blow in this town. I can feel it.
Oh great! He tried to kill me! You knew he would go off if he thought I fooled around with you.
Back to plan A. The vicious cycle all over again. Theo lets go of Sheila.
Now he's the one who's locked up and I'm the one who's free. If I gotta do this alone, I might as well start now. She revs up and peals out.
We provide some extracurricular activities for the senior citizens in the community.
Tell your little pal to let go.
Very good, busyboy.
In basic English, what does all this mean?
A squid?  The size of a whale?  I don't think so.  Target acquired.  Sixty yards.
Don't pull it, Norman.  It'll start a <u>fire</u> we can't stop.  Norman?
Captain.
Don't thank me, Dr. Johnson.  You weren't my choice.  The Pentagon made me take you.
A cyclone's on it's way in.  I thought they would have told you on the phone.
Maybe older --
Maybe we shouldn't.
You mean, what's in that thing is immortal?
Look, the ships are clearing out. They're taking us topside in a matter of minutes.  Someone can check him out there, if it's that imprtant.
'81, I think.  She tried again five years ago.  I thought you should know.
-- and then brought her down here --
-- I didn't know it would come to this --
Bullshit.  What's out there isn't alien.  It's an animal.
What the hell?  It shut us down.
I see it.
Can you open that panel?
What caused it?
Nothing, sir.
Yes, sir.
Norman, get out of there now! Norman?
Edmunds, get in here.  I need you for this.
Ted?  Captain?
To conceal a small break in the surface of the sphere.
What's the message?
Some sort of lead or something.
Radiation shield, you think?
How can he be missing?
To the spacecraft.  To investigate.
We can't go down there.  We're not prepared.  That deep?  That takes years of training, Beth.  We're just scientists.  Lab scietists.  We wear ties and lab coats to work -- not oxygen tanks.
A bad one.  It was the only book in there.  Norman, come here, look at this.
What do you mean -- not normal?
Yeah, why?
I didn't do anything wrong.  I didn't mean...
Where did you get this?
Where are you going in such a hurry?
I don't trust Harry to do it.
Yes, Norman.  I did.  You're just nervous.
... what do you mean?  I'm in the ship.
You get it straightened out?
You don't believe me.
What?
Manifested?
But how?
Ulcers.
Antibiotic.
What's that?
Three to six hours.
I'm sorry.
I'm feeling better.
You don't think I put something in it, do you?
Snakes?  What do you mean, exactly?
Then why, Beth?  Why go in?  Why put out explosives?  Why manifest the snakes?
Beth --
This is what I'm talking about, Norman.  Don't you see?  It's in you. This vindictiveness.  This rage.
Beth?
I know.  You're too strong, Beth.
You hear that?
When he woke up, he said we were out of food.  He told me to get some from the ship.
Yes you did.  Norman, I wouldn't leave you out there.  You know that.
We can refuse to talk.
How are you feeling, Norman?
Fine.  I'm fine.
Nice work, Norman.
I'm completely serious.  There is something very important missing from that spacecraft.  You know what that is?
You mean, you think I'm cracking?
Norman?
Thank you.  My suit -- Beth said she fixed it --
What happened to her?
Fine.
C'mon, Norman!
There is one possibility.
What is it, Harry?
Think about it.
We take a weeny little wedge, bang on it a couple of times, and bust off a chunk of the metal.  Yet any spacecraft -- even at a low velocity, say 200 miles an hour -- crashes into the water -- it's gonna be like hitting concrete, it would crumple like paper.  But there isn't a dent to be seen anywhere.  Not even a scratch.
Well, if it's a discharge --
If it is a message, it's probably a substitution code.  I'll work on it.
What report?
You mean they haven't told you yet?
You've heard of me?
Well, how about we wait and see what Harry comes up with?
You want to put him on your couch, Norman.  Grill him about his childhood?
You think Jerry has something to do with what killed Edmunds?  With what's out there?
Well, for one reason, we don't have your other five thousand.
Is that good or bad?
I... I'm not a Bendu Officer.  I'm not even a startrooper.
I'm afraid I've gotten too old for this sort of thing.
But you must!  I can't do it alone. I'm not at all like my father.  I'd never make it.
That's where my father was killed.
They use the Bogan Force.
What do I do?
Put that thing away or you're going to get us all killed.
The plans and specifications to a battle station with enough fire power to destroy an entire system... Our only hope in destroying it is to find its weakness, which we will determine from the data I stored in Artoo.
We captured the plans in a raid on the Imperial shipyards, but we fell under attack before I could get the data to safety, so I hid it in this Artoo unit and sent him off.
What about us?  Are we to wait forever?  Is our reward to be blown to bits on this forsaken system, while your fleet mounts some suicidal attack on that Death Star? Part of my reward is that I be around to spend it.
It's only light that doesn't affect it.  Solid things, like rocks, can hurt it!  Fire above him!
Get to the ship!
With four casualties?!
You'll get no information from me. You have no authority... the council can't hold me!
That's all right.  There is nothing anyone can do about it.  You can call me Luke.
Tell me where you've been.  I am going to become a startrooper and fight in the wars.  My father was a Jedi!  Were you in many battles?
Are you there, sir?  We're going...
What an honor...
Our love will grow, dear, year by year...
Rico, did you give the recruit permission to remove his helmet ?
Only 1 in 14 male applicants make it through stellar navigation. So what do you think your chances are ?
Johnny, I'm sorry it had to be your unit on Planet P. That mission had a very low survival probability...
Johnny, this is Zander.
It's amazing, us running into each other like this. Maybe it's fate.
This isn't simulation anymore. Take'er out easy, cadet.
You know I was talking to Captain, Deladier, and she said...
A funeral.
Yeah.
I thought I was dead. Lucky for me you jokers showed up, eh ?
Marco's sister. Can you imagine maneuvering half a million tons through crwoded space lanes... You gotta have nerves of steel ! Reflexes are critical
35% on the math final !  No one could be that dumb with numbers.
I don't want everyone to see.
I thought you were going to help Carl.
Carl can wait.
Well, if your dad doesn't like me, how come we're such good friends ?
Isn't it great to be in love ?
Shhhh...!
I thought you were KIA, Johnny...
This is Rodger Young, we're going down... Repeat, this is Rodger Young, we're going down...!
You were drifting. Flip six, three hole. On one, got it ?
What's your malfunction, Rico ?
Man, they're defended... no way in.
I don't stay where I'm not wanted.
If they didn't want you, they woulda kicked you out, amigo.
What's that, Diz ?
What frequency ?
...CUT OFF !
Good, because you're going to Harvard, and that's the end of it.
Well, it's just good to hear from you. What's up, son ?
Gillespie, put in call for retrieval. We're off this rock. Gillespie, do you read me ?
The Marauder power suit will prevent serious injury, but if you are hit, you will be non-operational and your team score will suffer accordingly. Rico, has each member of your squad completed a weapons safety check ?
Who said you could grow up so fast ? Last time I checked you were only five years old. You had such a bright little face...
Wait you two. Dad and I have a surprise for you that will settle this. Can you guess what it is ?
You got something to say about the Mobile Infantery ?
Rodger Young, prepare to receice outgoing fire...!  I'll take the first group.
Landing zone is extremely hostile. Come down on this transmission !
Mister Rasczak ?
Uni High Tigers, sir. Don't you remember ? I was captain of the team.
Sergeant, secure the boat !
V'ger is that which programmed me.
Kirk-unit, <U>why</U> do you not disclose information?
What is Enterprise's proper evolvement?
As I stated, V'ger calls to the Creator.
Sir! Airlock four has been opened; a thruster suit is reported missing!
I'm taking over the Center seat. I'm sorry, Will.
Then you acted properly, of course.
Captain, we've seen what their weapons can do. Shouldn't we take every possible precaution -- ?
How do you define <U>unwarranted</U>, <U>mister</U>?!
Well, Mr. Decker, it seems my bluff is being called.
Captain... this probe may be a key a key to the Aliens.
Negative control from inertial lag will continue 22 point five seconds before forward velocity slows to sub-light speed.
'Commander' Decker?
We're losing the pattern...!
I have accepted service here as a Starfleet officer... sir.
They have... they <U>have</U> been communicating with us. I sense ... <U>puzzlement</U>. Why have we not replied?
We are obviously confronted by a highly advanced mentality... yet they cannot understand who we are, or what we want.
We cannot break free, Captain.  We do not have a fraction of the power necessary.
Not for us?
Nope.
Why did you quit?
That's good.  That's really good.  You have a gift for words.
First organized fire department was on the border of Dalmatia and Sardinia in the year 642.
Everyday things...yes.

What happened?
Hi.
Thank you.
The other side.
Don't you think you should put them in water?
Why?
Do you truly believe the electoral process is absurd?
Because it's about <u>purity</u>...
Gosh, you look nice.
What is it all about?
I'll wait for you...I'm proud of you. I'll <u>be</u> waiting.
After Drama Group.
I wasn't doing business.
No.  Don't tell me that.
I'm sorry.
Cluster of events.  Don't see something, ten years, allasudden.  Three times inna night.
But, does it have to be an Old Mill?
They're holding it for ransom.
Yeah, but they never made a movie here.
Fifteen hands.

I'm an attorney, if there's anything you have to say to...
Aren't you ever in school?
I feel so <u>close</u> to you...
You have to hide.
Will you help me out...?
Claire, when did you...
What, what's there to <u>think</u> about?  The scene's perfect...I, I get to say...
Yeah.
Yes, yes, but...
...I know...I know...
I know, it's the hardest thing in the world, and it seems everybody wants...
...yes...
Hello.
Yes.

You said <u>three</u>...?
Where you off to?

Later for you, pal.
Hi.
My wife's going to have a baby.
You should.
You mean you need a witness in addition to White...?
Get Mitch Cohn on the phone in New York, tell him she's breaking her contract and we're very up...
I...
Some, you were, you were going to make a reservation for us?  Where's my schedule? Where are we <u>booked</u> tonight?
You what...?  Is that on the callsheet, is that on the callsheet, or is that <u>personal business</u>?  Ah, Christ. <u>Marty</u>...Are we <u>paying</u> you?
We're out of money.
Hey, it's with the Gods.  We don't have the money, we have to write it out.  The best or not.  And that's a lesson.  You get your typewriter yet...?
The movie's about <u>purity</u>.  So we don't <u>show</u> her breasts.  We show them to <u>him</u>, her back to the camera.
You want me to lie.
I'm out.
The girl was in the car.
...that's just so <u>narrow</u>...
...the house, the 1835.  The original <u>kitchen</u>, of course, burned in 1960, as part of a spate of fires...
How was your flight?
It's just a formality.
<u>Pay</u> her.
That we could use you in and I think that's quite a fine trade-off all around and an ill wind that blows somebody good.
Do something.
I want them thrown in jail.
And we're glad to have you here...
...we need the shooting permit for Main Street...
Ain't no second chances in life.
We have to lose the window.
Why?
Because they gots a window with a dogs in it.  You want me to "push in."  Or I can lose the shot.
Annabelle sucked her thumb last night.
I hate wax lips and red ants and pretzels without salt...

Ice cold water.
&quot;In the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon...&quot;
IS THAT YOU?
I think she's pretty, Mommy.
Yes...if you like big hair...
Mommy?
Not a lot, sweetie.  It's a country. Like Canada.  Only smaller.
You have the WORST flu since...
Ben.  God doesn't like visitors.
So we'll...radiate some more?
I've got it.  It's in the can, Cooper can wrap th...
Something's up wi...
Well, we're not discussing Rachel's age either.
You're WHERE?
But he hasn't.  He wandered off.  I know it's terrifying.  I can imagine how you felt when that call came -- But it happens.
Still, please.
She's a charmer, you'll see.  In fifty years, the kids'll love her ten percent as much as they love you.
Never stand between that kid and a meatball.
I had a lot of treatments, and they weren't any fun, but the tests show the cancer got smaller.
How do you hold down a job?  It's 8:10. You were supposed to be here at 7:00. She's missed her sunrise Groom'n Ride.
No.  I thought it might be uncomfortable for her --
Why not just bring the whole toilet?
Not personally.
What about obsessively picking her split ends?
And I know checking into your life was inexcusable...
Life's a trade-off.  You get cancer, your hair falls out, but you <u>do</u> get to smoke dope.
Oh, my God.
Eat your heart out.  Is Annabelle there?
Do what you've worked your whole life to do?

Doing the <u>right</u> thing.  Knowing who you <u>are</u>, inside.  Not <u>caving</u> to peer pressure, or <u>lowering</u> yourself to that level, <u>steering</u> your <u>own</u> course...
I love Luke, I love the children. But there is more to life than even love...
Why didn't I?
You ride with Annabelle...
I didn't want to spoil our supper...
Just a babysitter -- I mean...you're working...
I trust you of course I do but --
Look.  I know they hate me.
They don't hate you --
Really?  Look in your ex-wife's eyes.
It's complicated for Jackie.  It's complicated for me...You don't have kids -- you don't understand --
Why in the world would she t...
'But keep dancing, and if you're lucky, I might just never leave, who knows?'
Hi, I'm here to pick up Ben.
Well, I'm supposed to watch Schindler's List for homework. The movie's like almost four hours. And then I'm supposed to write a report on survivors.  You know any survivors, Dad?
Even though it was only his cousins that were killed?
Ahh...tell me. What do you want to do for me? What's your idea?
Be your sidekick, you know, and maybe eventually become a TV talk- show host.
Yes.
But like, what do you like to do when you're not working?
My Jesus…
Consuelo, what is rape exactly?
This is entertainment you're making, Toby. This story about a kid in the suburbs and the state of the college admissions process has, with this Brady crisis, evolved into something much richer and more provocative.
Yes, I know…But still, it should be somewhat entertaining.
No, no, no. No exploitation. This is serious…But don't you find it a little funny too, at the same time?
You've got a family tragedy on your hands. Will you tell me what's funny about that? About a kid in a coma?
Hip alternative types who will understand the process better…
What's an audience going to tell you?
Sure!...
I just want to know what the hell he's doing in his room that's so interesting he doesn't come down for dinner.
...gger.
Say, 'Nigger.'
Nigger, fuck me hard!
Again!
Nigger, fuck me hard!!...
C'mon. Talk to me. Tell me what you're thinking.
Ah-hah. And how is it you hope to achieve this goal?
Toby Oxman.
Great!
Yeah, well, then it got me writing, so that was a good thing.
Anything I might know about?
Uh, well, anyway, so I'm looking for subjects for this documentary on teenage life in suburbia. Kind of an exploration of the mental psyche of its mythology. I wrote to Derrida to see if he'd like to do the narration. But everything's still kind of in development at this point.
Yeah...um...so anyway, tell me. What about you? I'd heard through the grapevine you were producing movies.
How many?
OK. Bye.
Yeah. I know.
Sure…um…yeah, as soon as I have a screening I'll let you know.
Uh-oh!  Do you know if the demands are being taken seriously at this point, or does Washington think these people are just a bunch of crazy fuckers playing games?
I'll lead.
--be prepared.
What's that supposed to mean?
What happened?
I suppose...you think I should thank you.
I insist...
We've prohibited the networks from broadcasting the transmissions.
Good.
Who's Ryan Cooper?
And what exactly do they intend to do?
What do they have in there that's so valuable?  A cure for AIDS, a cure for cancer?
What the hell is it, anyhow?
Agreed--let's move it.
Why should I worry?  Is there a problem?
Dissent?
Can I have a glass of water?
At his office in the Capitol.
Bah!  All you wanted to do was spy in our country!
Give that back to me.
You're absolutely right.  We wouldn't.  No sane nation ever would.  That's why it was designed to trigger itself automatically.
Look, Colonel.  I've got to talk to somebody at Air Command.
What is your name, young lady?
I didn't say anything.  What's the meaning of disturbing me at this hour, Colonel?
Be fair, Mister President.  Didn't we initiate the Human Reliability tests for all personnel handling nuclear weapons?
Yes?
Combat Operations Center, Major Mandrake speaking.
Do you recognize my voice?
All right, Major.  I'm putting the base on condition Red.
Condition Red!
No calls from inside out.  No calls from outside in are even answered.  No calls.
Are you hard of hearing, Major?
Sort of like a new hobby, huh, General?
You know the regulations well, Major.
Well, I was thinking, maybe an enemy attack is not in progress?
Suppose that were the case?
I suppose they are, sir.
He said war was too important a matter to be left to Generals.
I'm trying to, sir.
You see, Major, at this very moment, while we sit and chat, a decision is being made by the President in the War Room.  He knows that the enemy will pick up our planes on their radar in about twenty minutes.
That's right, sir.  And don't forget in a few years a lot of other countries will have the bomb.  What if they start something?
Major, you're talking like one of them!
If they gave us what we think we need, yes, I guess we would.
And you'd like to see that?
To peace on earth, Major.
I'm afraid so, Mister Presient. Being part of the air-borne alert, each plane is carrying a full load - about fifty megatons apiece.
Then there's no chance for recall?
General Jack D. Ripper, sir.
Mister President, there were thirty-four aircraft involved.  Thirty acknowledged the recall.  That makes four shot down.
Thanks, Binky.  Can you see Bromdingna Island yet?
War.
Between Mach 3 and 4.
Twenty!  Twelve o' clock.
Hey, King.  Somebody at Burpelson has a very perverted sense of humor.
No kidding.
Well, if there's a war, they must have hit us first.
Master safety.
No, look!  It's "OPE - Recall Mistake."
Lieutentant Zogg, how would you like your black butt slung into a General Court Martial when we get back???
But the code is made up by General Ripper, and he's the only one left at the base who would know the code.
Nobody's loyalty is beyond question.  Besides, how do we know one of his staff didn't see it?
We crossed the coast over an hour ago. Okay?
Well, I can't get out and look, King.  But I don't get a green light.
But I get a red light.
King, would you mind if I keep me hands on the wheel when you take her in?
I'd be mighty proud if you did, Lothar.
Can I have some?
How long were you in there?
Well, sure, he's rich and he's famous. He's got everything and you've got nothing.
Yeah, but, when I was walking, I realized that he's stuck in that limo all the time. He's stuck with his interviews, he's stuck with his autograph, he has to do whatever his manager tells him to do, you know? He's not free. He's just part of the machine, and if you think about it, freedom's all that there really is.
Mm-hm.
That was really great.
Was it okay?
Yeah!
Typical male.
Oh. Well, what's it on?
Your ability to fantasize is only exceeded by your ability to lie.
Hey, it's me. No, that's, that's the ultimate liar of liars.
Oh, yeah, yeah. Wait, um, how do you figure that?
No, no, I wasn't trying.
Okay, Buff, listen to me for a second alright?
Buff, listen to me. Could you just-
Buff...
She's dead?
No, no, no.
Yeah, he's told me. Burnfield. We all hear about Burnfield.
Your his publicist?
Oh, I'll teach you how to surf even if you don't get the gig.
Score! Yeah!
I'll tell you what. When I get my engineering degree and I'm swimming in my swimming pool, it will be very fucking okay.
Yeah, well, uh, you're not so smart, chief, 'cause I'm moving out to L.A.
You could do it.
I could.
Okay.
You cut off your little finger?
Erica. So do you think you and I are alike, Erica?
Deep down. Way down.
No, no, see, you, you don't understand.
Uh-huh.
Hey, he's a human being you can give him that much.
They let you out?
Yeah, of course they let me out. Chickenshits. I gotta pay some class C misdemeanor ticket. So did I call it or did I call it? She spent the night, didn't she? Hm? Oh, that sucks for you, pal. Oh, shit.
Oh, Jeff, give me a break. You didn't even have the guts to go look in the van, did you?
Jeff! Come up here!
You know, it's not you. You know? You seem like a smart guy.
Oh, it's very complicated, huh?
Because maybe if we know each other's names, things wouldn't get like this, My name's Jeff.
Okay. Nazeer, okay?
No.
It's a piece.
About what?
About things that are important to me.
Name one.
God, KAREN JOHNSON.
Your completely missing the point.
Hey!
No, sweetie. Cynicism is bullshit.
I can't wait till Pony gets here, you know? Have a conversation with a human being?
It was just something that got out of hand. Did anyone get hurt?
I would've stopped it.
How?
Of course.
Okay, look. My job is not who I am. I don't need that. Why? What's your goal? Status? Money? Getting your picture on the cover of some glossy magazine?
So, what, why can't you do that here? What's wrong with here? Why is somewhere else better?
No, I don't.
No, no, I have to talk to you.
I'm leaving. Is that alright with you? Do I have your permission? Maybe you want to think about it.
Where are you going?
For a ride.
Well, what about us?
What?
Oh yeah, yeah, we're starting to get good placement and shit like that, you know.
Nah, nah, nah, nah.
Hey, I though you guys were coming to the show, man?
Sorry.
You know, I've thought about that, actually.
Yeah, well, that's what I do too.
Hey, where's Erica?
This has nothing to do with me, this, uh, drinking, yeah.
Oh, yeah?
Oh, uh... uh, the other night our manager Danny took us to this restaurant and there was Sandra Bernhard.
You do not want me to do your cover.
You're not serious.
Okay, now, you guys all take care, okay? Oh, man, I feel so good. I feel good 'cause I'm hanging out with you guys, man. You know? I mean, I forgot what it was like to just hang out.
Jesus, Jeff.
Yeah. Burnfield, Pizza and Puke capital of the world.
Soon.
I think about you. I mean, a lot.
Is that Jeff?
Tim, why don't you shut the fuck up?
What the fuck are you talking about?!
What are you? Her pimp? She said she might go get a drink first.
Pal, she's a big girl, you know? I'm sure she's alright.
Whatever.
Yeah.
Hey, great game Friday. Kicked Holbrook's ass, huh?
Ha! Thank you! See? He did it. He left.
It was the nicest thin I've done in a long time.
Wait!  Did you say you are pregnant or you were pregnant... You had it, threw it out and you're gonna go back and dance all night!
And you know real cops aren't half as smart as Keanu.
Forget it.  I've got a scholarship to Harvard hanging over my head.  I won't risk it.
Di, are you okay?  We can skip the girl party this week.
Well, if I had to guess...  I'd say that was the sound of a mother saying good-bye to her little boy and hello to a young man who's going to be a daddy of his own...  Jack, do you know what I see here?
So, while we're knee deep in right now - and things seem pretty "stinky" - in the long run, we're going to grow strong from this.
I sure do.
Uh, Jack - look, I can explain...
Uh, "no"... You're not fat.
Shut up.
It's all my fault.  I'm sorry I ever started this...
Hey.  Eyes on your own belly!
Oh no...
Don't use big bills!
Yeah?
Bullets?  No bullets!  Oh my gosh, these are just to scare people. Kinda like round-off, back handspring, whip back, double full.  You never really use it - you just want the opposing squad to know you've got it.
I-I didn't mean to say "whore," Diane. I just hear it so much at church - it kinda came flying out of my head.
It wasn't like the prison we saw - all these women had to shave their heads because they got lice from the filthy lives they'd lived!  Oh G-d, I'm gonna be someone's bald bitch!
Is that you down there?
You sure you wanna go there?
They could kill you.
Your help.
Diane, it says here you're going to have mood swings, uncontrollable gas.
I hate to think where that puts me.  I could be her father.
I didn't mean to --
Say, you're not really smuggling opium these days,  are you?
I'll take it.
Hello, Mr. Sheldrake.  On that Bases Loaded.  I covered it with a 2-page synopsis.  But I wouldn't bother.
This is Miss Kramer.
I felt a little guilty, so I got out some of your old stories.
Who wants true? Who wants moving?
I've got some ideas myself.  One of them being this is New Year's Eve.  How about living it up a little?
As for instance?
Well....
Hungry? After twelve years in the Burmese jungle.  I am starving, Lady Agatha -- starving for a white shoulder --
I was afraid of that.
You know, I'd take you up on that in a minute.  I'm just not good enough to do it all by myself.
What about all those ideas you had?
Sorry.  It's your baby now.
Good for you.  You've got yourself the best guy in town.
What's wrong with you tonight? What is it, Betty?
Something came up.  I don't want to talk about it.
Ever been in one of these old Hollywood palazzos? That's from when they were making eighteen thou- sand a week, and no taxes.  Careful of these tiles, they're slippery. Valentino used to dance here.
Whose?
Did you see them? Did you see how they came?
I had some trouble with my car. Flat tire.  I pulled into your garage till I could get a spare. I thought this was an empty house.
Just a minute, you!
You're a writer, you said.
Fair enough.
It certainly could use a pair of shears and a blue pencil.
I will not have it butchered.
Hollywood.  The Alto Nido Apart- ments.
It's all taken care of.  It's all paid for.
I'm used to paying my own bills.
The one where you go to the slave market.  You can cut right to the scene where John the Baptist -
Not now, my dear.  I'm playing three no trump.
Please.  Now I've forgotten how many spades are out.
The other guests?
There are no other guests.  We don't want to share this night with other people.  This is for you and me.
Shut up.  I'm rich.  I'm richer than all this new Hollywood trash. I've got a million dollars.
How do you like that? We've made twelve pictures together. His greatest successes.
How did it go?
You'd better get to bed yourself.
You went out last night, didn't you, Joe?
I just happen to know it.  I had a nightmare and I screamed for you.  You weren't here.  Where were you?
Oh.  sure -- if it would make a good scene.
No, they don't.
De Mille didn't have the heart to tell you.  None of us has had the heart.
Madame is waiting.
How come?
How about my going up the kitchen stairs and undressing in the dark. Will that do it?
I'm not inquiring where Mr. Gillis goes every night...
Frankly, no.
Was it a sudden quarrel?  Had there been any trouble between you before?
Did he have a wife?  Did he had a girl friend?  Did you know them?
Wait a minute.  I want you to get out the car.  You're going to take the script over to Paramount and deliver it to Mr. De Mille in person.
Oh, fiddlesticks. What could be dangerous about a baseball game?
Is he your entertainment for tonight?
He will be. In about five minutes.
No way. I'm not going to let that little hussy make a monkey out of me.
Maybe it was just an accident.
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
No.
I thought I'd show you one of my favourite places.
Away. From you.
And now?
I don't see why not.
What's that big black scar on the ground? Like a fire.
Don't think I'm weak, just because I'm a woman. I have Power. Give in, stop fighting me, Ethan. I always get what I want.
This is your problem, right here. This girl's driving you insane, Ethan. Let me help you.
You've been without water for a whole day. Let's see how thirsty you get in a week.
You're a regular Einstein, aren't you?
Someone's chasing him.
You were? You mean we could've been... you-know-what... all this time?
Be brave, my .daughter. Be wise.
Lucy; come back!
I'm afraid I have some bad news about your car.
You're not gonna stay for the ice cream?
What can I do for you?
No plans for the weekend, Linda?
Which of you is willing to make that sacrifice?
The Danvers. And two of your little friends.
You've run out of things to throw, Selena.
I'm free. I can never thank you enough.
Why?
Takes a long time, you know, learning the wand. Just begun to understand it myse1f. Give things a kind of life--can also take away life; works backwards too. Besides I can't let you take my wand. Only have the one, what would I do? I'd be helpless. It's out of the question.
Superpowers. Got you in a lot of trouble, didn't they?
What?
Roebush! That's  the guy! Buddy, he's gonna nail our behinds to the wall! this is Special Order! He said he had to have it before...  Omigod!! What's tomorrow?
Tuesday.
Hey! Y'know what they used to call me in high school?
Man, you don't never pass out, do ya?
Hey, he'll be all right. Believe me Lana, I know. I was a late bloomer myself.
Well, aren't you excited?
Mr. White, please, I promised those people I'd get back to them by this morning. What do you think?
Mr. Kent! Superman was here!
Don't call me a bum! I ain't no bum!
Columbia.
A very wise man once said...I think it was Attila the Hun... "It's not enough that I succeed. Everyone else must fail."  And you are going to do it for me.
Every oil tanker and super- tanker and super-duper-tanker in the ocean is controlled. totally, by computers. Computers to tell them where to go, how much oil to take on, where to deliver it.
We've already got some.
I invented it, man. In my head. It's a stone killer-diller get-down get-it-on and twice-on-Sunday super mutha computer.
What will it get me?
Can you do that?
You want to mess with Superman?
Thanks.  Let's go
Hey listen, I didn't know your mama was comin' by...
Oh. I'm Lana Lang. This is Ricky.
Kent's been invited to his high-school class reunion.
I can't see anything.
Come on, will you?  We've got to get ready before he gets here.
Cut the mush, Lorelei. He's after our skin!
I can't! It's out of control!
53.
Okay? Goodbye.
Mr. White, the next number, please?
It could make weather!
You mean...you mean...Vera! Vera! The magnitude of this!!!
Chicken feed.  If Gus Gorman can push the right buttons ---
And now that Superman's out of the Nice Guy business...
So far the hostages are unharmed.
Not everyone can have X-ray vision, you know.
I do?
Superman? Oh, was he here?
You've been under a lot of pressure lately -
Lois, I . . .
I was right. you are Superman.
I didn't think I wanted to.
What else could I do?
Lois, I really don't see why --
Everything on it?
Actually I was trying to catch up on my reading. There's a lot of Dickens I never got around to --
How would you like to take a little vacation? I mean you've earned it, you know? You deserve it.
A bikini! I'll need to buy a new bikini, Lex.  C'mon. After being cooped up in that prison, haven't you thought about me in a bikini . . ...once maybe ?
Look at this! Snow. Ice.  Your idea of a good time.
This way Lex.
What's a curl?
The Elders have, of course, thought long and hard about that question.
That little black box goes beyond any known conventional radar, it tracks Alpha Waves.
We have all of this without you. You cannot bargain with what you don't have.
Oh, General, the world is a big place. Thank goodness, my needs are small...As  it turns out, I have this affinity for beachfront property . . .
Like it? It's magnificent!  Not that it couldn't use a woman's touch. Especially around dinner time.
No drinks . No movie. This is the last time I take a charter flight.
Strange. I tore those metal fibers like paper. And what he did . . ..  Was amazing!  Something is happening . . ..
You are master of all you survey.
Did you really believe we would give up our advantage?
It's brilliant. Daddy thinks so, too. You'll write a new series -- 'Metropolis After Hours.'
Oh . . . no, there's no one back home.
Shouldn't you pay the cabbie?
Hi. Is dinner ready? I'm famished.
You'll find a good man Lacy. You deserve one.
I don't think we're being treated fairly, Lois. And I'm going to tell Miss Warfield.
Close the curtains. The sun is hurting my eyes.
No, Daddy. Our business is journalism. We can't continue to be so irresponsible . . . or else we'll just lead everyone into a disaster.
And your heart beats faster just thinking about him.
. . . I look at you, Lenny, and I know how the Romans felt when the barbarians arrived at their city gate.
Didn't you see it? He lifted me up and crashed me down.
He's . . . cold. . .
I hadn't counted on this but . . .  . . . of course - the power of the sun has given him internally generated heat. I am a ...
Your time in prison has twisted you into a delusionary state, Luthor.
Precisely. And then it came to me. My greatest ever plan. I made a deal with some minor league Bad Boys. Arms Dealers, Renegades Generals, You know the type. With you gone, we'll make a fortune rearming the world.
He's thirty-five years old.
Thank you.
You and Lois, you get all the action.  There she is, out in the wild West and everything.
Don't worry, Mom. I know.
I'll bet you have some good ideas.
Your bookie?
What now, my love?
It's not what you think. Darn it. I'm going out on a story. The Secretary of Defense is landing at the airport tonight and this kid's going to be there to make sure he answers a few questions he'd rather duck.
No. I'm just thinking that you smoke too much, if you don't mind my saying so.
Not unless you can fly.
There weren't any wires. I looked.
He grabbed me! He held me! He set me down gently! How could that be done with mirrors?
Help! I mean  --  I can't stop saying it. Silly, isn't it  -  There's nothing to worry about. Help! See.
Besides that.
Compared to what came before? A year of living in the sewers?  A part of that will always be with me.
Krypton!
Meteorites!
Tune me in , lady. An explosion such as the one Superman describes would have altered the molecular structure of the Krypton rock.
You're happy, aren't you?
But if I put my leg out like Claudette Clobert in  --
Yours not to reason why, Miss Teschmacher. Relax! Enjoy it!  Just look at that smog!
Your volcano chum? Your junior life-saving buddy?  Let's get high.
Jor-El, Be warned. This tone of yours approaches insolence.
All these years, happy as we've been, how I prayed and prayed He'd see fit to give us a child. And just when I finally accepted my bitter lot...  No one must ever know.
Guess I'd better hitch up the rig and come back to get that...that thing he was settin' in. What do you make of that thing? Martha? You listening?
Who? Clark? I never cared two hoots for that fella.  Jonathan Jr. That's got a ring to it.
A million years behind us.  Jor-El, he's only a baby.
No! You couldn't imagine -
Oh, God! I'm going to die!
The answer is yes. Now what's the question?
This is incredible. I was just sitting here trying to figure out how to contact you. I mean, you don't have an answering service, right?
Sure.
Now then, Otis. Did you get what I asked for?
There.
Maybe I should get help.
And what does he do again?
No, Mr. Ansel.  I wouldn't sue you.
Case?
I used to like it here.  I used to care about what happened.  Now I think I'll sell my house and move the fuck away.
No, Billy.  We can't drop the lawsuit.  You know how much we need the money.
She said she's got to be home by nine.
Sure.
I stopped by the station a while ago.  I stared at the bus.  I could almost hear the kids inside.  There was a lawyer there.  He told me he'd gotten you signed up.  Is that true?
Do they have any reputation for drugs?
And they loved Bear.
Those are all from the fair last year.  Abbott and me were judges at the pet show.
From what?
That's the way I thought of them sometimes.
What do you mean?
Yes.
What happened to summer?
The Pied Piper of Hamelin. By famous Hanover city; The river Weser, deep and wide, Washes its wall on the southern side; A pleasanter spot you never spied; But, when begins my ditty...
What's a ditty again?
Yes.
Well, if he knew magic - if he could get the kids into the mountain - why couldn't he use his pipe to make the people pay him for getting rid of the rats?
So he was mean?
No.  Not mean.  Just...very angry.
That you didn't die?  Like the other children?
It would be strange if you didn't feel that way.
I have no questions.
Do you have a room?
What do they do?
Why are you calling me, Zoe?
That's not news, Zoe.
Some more wine?
You've been retained?
Yes.
I was scared.
You saw the speedometer?
Of course.
You're going to need special care for a long time to come.  It's not going to be easy.  Not for you, not for any of us.  Because we love you so much.  And it's going to cost money.  More than we can imagine.
How will he do that?
No.
Nicole, tomorrow Mr. Stephens wants you to make your deposition at the courthouse.  I thought I'd take you over.
He couldn't look at me.  But I looked at him.  Right at him.  His secret was mine now.  We used to share it.  But not anymore.  Now, I owned it completely.
Well, okay.  I'll take you about nine-thirty in the morning.  That's okay with you?
How are you tonight, Mr. Falco?
Frank, I think maybe you lied to me.
You told me that your boy was washed up with Susie Hunsecker, didn't you?
Blessings on thee, the both...well... Gotta run now.  See you two kids later!
Son, lots of people tell me I'm a gifted man, but I still can't see around corners.
Why do you keep coupling me with Falco?
Susie, you're very much in my thoughts today.
Why are you trembling, dear...?
When I'm certain, I'll let you know...
Susie, did you know about this accusation...?
No...
Not "we", Sidney, you!
Sure, he steams her up - wants her to stand on her own two feet and all that jazz!
Don't go wild, Sidney.
- He's got them on him.
Rita, say hello to Otis Elwell.
Don't you know who that man is?
If that's for me, tear it up!
Only two men in this town could be responsible for that smear - you or Hunsecker or both.
Frank, you don't listen!  J.J. just told you to shut your mouth!
Yes, but why?
Don't run away - I was always the man for you!  I'm talking to you out of two years of silence - listen to what I say!  Inside of six months -
J.J., if you think -
I have a message for you; I love you.  May I dedicate the next number to you?...And the next, and the next. Every Sunday I'll buy you a new bonnet -
And on Tuesday - Hasenpfeffer. STEVE  How do you think I realized I love you?
Steve, I feel exhausted...what do you want me to do?
Look, whatever you want me to do, I'll do.  I just want my kids to have a chance to grow up, okay?
No good.
Holy shit... you're really real!  I mean... whoah!  You're, uh... like a machine underneath, right... but sort of alive outside?
You sure?
TERMINATED!?  Shit!  Why didn't you tell me? We gotta right now!
Why?
What?
Does it hurt?
Why do you cry?
Uh-unh, no, it's different... It's when there's nothing wrong with you but you hurt anyway.  You get it?
Yeah.  Drag, huh?
Mom?  You okay?
John, get out of the way!!
I love you.  I always will.
I'll bet. Makes you a more efficient killer, right?
Doesn't want you thinking too much, huh?
The man most directly responsible is Miles Bennet Dyson, Director of Special Projects at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.
Jesus.  How much do you know about Dyson?
The CPU from the first terminator.
Are you afraid?
On all what?
When he made his decision, he couldn't have known everything. Especially not the way people like you do, who've returned from exile and feel that you have a right to pass judgement. Because you are blameless, you think you know best who is a sinner and who deserves forgiveness. But you have no idea how people lived here.
When he met Hitler at his birthday and shook hands with him, was he pleased?
For Chrissakes I hate that shit, cut it out.
You bet.
and totally irrelevant.
Your manner.
Let Furtwängler go. Please.
Yes. She suffered longer. She was in Ravensbruck.
No. Ours was damaged.
Bruckner's Seventh, Major.
I'm sorry but I have to leave. I'll find other work. You'll have to get someone else, that's all.
Then why is it, please, that another conductor who was actually a member of the Party, who used to play the Horst Wessel before his concerts, has already been cleared and is working again while I have to wait and wait and wait?
I believe it was because of another letter I'd written to Goebbels lamenting the decline of musical standards due to racial policies.
It would be truer to say, I think, that a lot of people in high places knew me.
Steve Arnold...
Certainly not, but I knew he had informers everywhere. Even in my orchestra there was someone
Maintain liberty, humanity and justice.
'Happy birthday, dear Adolf, love Wilhelm.' Or words to that effect. That sounds to me like you were dropping on your knees and saying, 'Okay, Adolf, you win. You're the number one man. Have a swell party.'
You won't find it because no such telegram exists.
Isn't it true that because he gave you bad reviews and praised this young guy, Von Karajan, called him a goddamn miracle, said he was a better conductor than you, then you had von der Null conscripted into the army and no one's heard from him since?
You sure you didn't call one of your close buddies and say, God in heaven, did you see what that guy von der Null wrote about me? The greatest conductor on earth. I want him out the way. He had the nerve to accuse me I am not playing enough modern music. Send him to Stalingrad. Isn't that what you did? You don't like criticism, do you, Wilhelm?  You surely didn't like them saying there was another conductor who was better than you... Are you saying the name von der Null was never mentioned in your talks with Goebbels?
And what did he say?
And what happened to Von der Nul?
This is absolute nonsense!
What?
I believe that. But just answer the question, don't give me explanations.
Do you know what that is?
Helmuth Alfred Rode. Second violinist since 1935. What's it mean, second violinist?
Do you know what's in this archive?
Yes, you remember.
Yeah?
Never heard of him, who is he?
And ask him about his private life.
Oh! The evening before, I see...
You ever seen Adolf Hitler's eyes when he was making a speech? I've seen 'em on films.
Well, they say here that when you went on a case, you stayed on it.  Now we can't take every Nazi in this country to trial, although I would like to; it's an impossibility. So we're going for the big boys in industry, education, law, culture.
Rudolf Otto Werner. Wind section since 1936. What instrument did you play?
It was Hermann Goering. I was told he just made the maestro his Privy Councillor, no questions asked. Although Dr. Furtwängler stood up to him. And to Dr. Goebbels.
It was Beethoven's Ninth.
Mmm.  Same schedule's okay.
Any one of them's ideal for home defense. Which'll it be?
You can't to that...
This is a mistake.  I haven't done anything.
And you're from the future too?
It's okay.  Forget it.
What?
I'm sure.
You'll learn.
Sleep.  It'll be light soon.
Okay.  Talk some more.
Well, we're gonna uninvent the bastard.  Eighty-six it.  We'll blow up the place...burn it down.  Something.
I want to buy you a hot dog so bad,Kyle...all the things you've never seen and done.  You're here, but wherever you go, and whatever you touch, you bring the war with you.
He'll find us, won't he?
That's not what I meant. Was there someone special?
I don't think I like this.
Sarah.
SKYNET.  A computer defense system built for SAC-NORAD by Cyber Dynamics.  A modified Series 4800.
You go naked.  Something about the field generated by a living organism.  Nothing dead will go.
Okay.  Okay.  But this...  cyborg...if it's metal...
Why don't you just stretch out here and get some sleep.  It'll take your mom a good hour to get here from Redlands.
I can't sleep.
Send a unit.
Projections were far too optimistic.
But, the expectation was ten.  And, in this case, expectation is everything.
I've heard good things about their London branch.  You have to admit, it sounds like some fantasy, role-playing nonsense.
Terrific.  I now have a hundred dollar dry cleaning bill.
What are you babbling about, psycho?
This is nuts.
If there was one.
I'll give you a boost.
You first.
Your <u>shoes</u> cost a thousand dollars?
I know the owner of Campton Place.  I could talk to him in the morning.
Didn't think I'd ever see you again.
Where'd you get this?
Take the picture out of the frame and show it to me.
What are you doing... ?
It could have been any asshole with a couple hundred million in the bank.
What the fuck are you... ?
It's mine...
Bullshit.  They killed him. Feingold, Fisher, whoever... they shot him...
Okay... okay...  I put it down.  Now open that door. Mister Fisher's right on the other side of that door.  He's an actor...
Think about it!  They followed you every step of the way.  There was always a safety net.  The taxi, there was a diver.  At my house, the window was rigged... they shot at us with blanks...
Is this something you're interested in?  I'm not really that person I was.
They gave me a free jacket at the door.
"Consumer Recrreation Services." What, do they make golf clubs?
Trust me.  Call that number.
Tell me where we're going.
You dodged a bullet.
What have they been doing to you?
It's a flat tire.  That's all.
We have to head out... just wanted to say goodbye.
You're going?  Well, thanks again.  Good to see you, Rachel...  Thanks for coming, Mel.  I'll get your car back.  Right now it's, uh... at the zoo.  Sorry.
No, I mean, what is it FOR?  What are you selling?
Physical?
Goddamnit, why do they do that?
Guess!
Ah, Mr. Van Orton.  Here you go...
Dinner's in the oven.
Fine.
What makes you ask?
Not much, I think.
No.
Look... what I'm doing is none of your business...
Anything wrong... ?
What's happened...
He hasn't called back.
Bravo, young man.  you have to tell me what this was all about sometime.  I want you to know... when it looked there for awhile like you were going slowly insane... I was fully prepared to have you committed to the <u>finest</u> mental-health facility available.  I mean that sincerely, don't thank me.
Hi, Luke Sanderson, bad sleeper, I'm your basic tosser-turner, and you are...
And what kind of sleeper?
I only saw Theo drive up.
It's not going to hold your weight.
Nell!
No, Malcolm!  Individual performance is only part of it.  I know why baseball players choke for no reason, I know why violinists throw up with fear before every concert, and need to, to give a great performance, but what I want to know is, how fear works in a group...
I have a bad feeling about what you're doing.
Someone is playing with you.
Nell, the first time I ever spoke with you in person was the night we met here.
Come on.
Here's how they're organized. Groups of five, very different personalities: scored all over the Kiersey Temperament Sorter just like you asked for.  And they all score high on the insomnia charts.
Have either of you seen David Watts?
Well this is a cozy breakfast.
Your fear of him was real.  That's all the ghost anyone needs.
What do you want?
Who?
Don't worry, I probably won't be in here much.  Light sleeper.
No.
You've been out of the world for a long time, haven't you?
Good night, Theo.
David?
You want to move to New York, you want to move in with me?
This is real, I'm not making it up!  Theo, you saw it!  You were there -- the banging and last night.  You, you all saw the painting!
I used to hate it.  Now I like it.
I'm so glad we're having this chat.
It's not a knock.
It's not a compliment.
Why?
Italian.
We all did.
What the papers used to call a "gangland slaying."
Why, because you're my security consultant?  This cocksucker nearly burnt my house down.
I mean, Gordon must weigh a good four hundred pounds.
You broke last time.
Fuck you.
Huh?
Man knows what he likes.
That's a high-end item.  Total reliability.
That's what I thought, man.  But it was not a hotel or nothin' that we went to. It was someplace else.
Did Jenny know?
Who'd Jenny get it off of -- this grass or whatever?
I think you didn't get that lot in the Navy, doing your National Service.
Probation?  Man, you crazy.  They shouldn't've let you outta your country, much less prison.
Not me, man.
He came in with Jenny to the restaurant where I work.  That's not where they met.
What are we standing on?
Too easy?
I've been wondering something.
Perhaps it was the smoke.
Now who's being sarcastic?
She never told anyone else.  About the convict strain -- or is it stain?  No, I was privileged.  I was someone who helped Jenny efface her past.
You weren't disappointed in her, then.
When did you get in?
Well, don't suppose she did, really, most of her life.  On her own after her mum died.  Aunts and uncles for a time -- and then the bright lights beckoned.
Now, you shouldn't run yourself down.  My employer, Mr. Lindgren --
What line is he in.
I see.
Well, not to say Mr. Lindgren is dishonest, exactly.
What'd you want me to do.  Stay at home, twiddlin' me thumbs.  Doing sweet F.A. [Fuck All].
You mean if they'd nabbed you before you actually broke and entered you would only have been charged with making a mess.
Did you.  What was that in aid of?
Overnight.  What about just now?
Just now?  Overnight?
I don't believe it.
You ever been to London?
Not that I recall.
She never would have turned you in, not in a million years.
Well, I'll tell you.  I believe this Valentine screwed me out of a fair sum of money.
It was you.  Downtown.
In which case I'll just do what I usually do.
Ian?
I had to, didn't I.  Nothing else for it. Then just when I'd finished my nine years -- my contract -- wallop, I had to bugger off to the States.
I got half.
Ever take a look at the women who work in pet stores?  Wow.
I dunno.  I just said she's nice lookin'.
What d'you mean, any happier?
Straight rotation, no shit, call your shot.
What?
What's in it?
Drugs?  Cash?  Both if we're lucky.
How we gonna get that lucky?
What kind of trouble are you in?
You know I don't live with him.
It's been five minutes and I'm packing to leave again.  I can't believe this.
Ah.
Great bloke.  Really turned things around there.  180 degrees.
Ann--
...You don't like the music out there?
Hello, Rachel.
Anyway, uh... my point is you're young. A kid really, your whole life ahead of you. But it's not too soon to start thinking... to start making opportunities for yourself. Before it all washes away.
But more or less.
I do appreciate the interest you've taken, though.
Ze girl?... She seems like a very nice girl. She *plays*, monsieur, like a very nice girl. Ztinks. Very nice girl. However, ztinks.
...she can go up there.
That right.
Do? Hell, nothing. Well, you'll want to keep tabs on your investment, of course, but I'm looking for a silent partner. I've done the research, I've contacted the vendors, the deal is set. I'm just looking for venture capital, friend. Disappear if you want, check in whenever you like--I want the dough; I don't take attendance.
Way out of line.
That'll be fine.
...Yeah, that's it. As per our discussion.
How's business, Dave?
Specialty store down in Sacramento.
Uh-huh.
How much to they want, Dave?
The sonofabitch. The blackmailer. It's, uh, it's no one you know. It's a businessman from Sacramento. A goddamn pansy, Ed. He tried to rope me into some crackpot scheme; I heard him out and then told him to go to hell. And the very next day, the very next day, Ed, I get blackmailed for the same amount.
Would he... it sounds pretty obvious.
Dave.
Honey.
You don't have to--
It was Big Dave's.
--don't interrupt me--that's Means. They got a fine upstanding pillar of the business community as a victim, and then they got *you*, a disgruntled number-juggling underling who on the day in question was drunk as a skunk and whose alibi for the time in question is being passed out at home, alone.
...Did Big Dave mention that it was something about his war service? I don't know, I wasn't there, *you'll* have to tell *us*. Maybe he specified, maybe he didn't; I'm not putting words in your mouth; the point is that this liar, this cynical manipulator, this man who through his lies sneered and belittled the sacrifice and heroism of all our boys who *did* serve and bleed and puke and die on foreign shores, and who made a fool out of this entire town, turns to *you* to help him out of his jam. Fat-assed sonofabitch!
No thanks.
Uh-huh. He's the, uh...
Haven't I seen you up in ladies' wear?
That was something. I'm Ed Crane.
Uh-huh.
...Ed?
...You sure, Eddie?
Yeah.
Frank, uh, you know I'll try to contribute, but, uh--Freddy Riedenschneider--
I don't care what it costs! This is when ya come together!
They're just people like you and me, Ed. Remember that.
Are you awake?... Is he awake?
You'll go to the prison hospital.
What'd he say? Does he understand?
If you like them, they're for sale. Another day like yesterday and half the collection will be on the block.
Fifteen... what's next?
It's fool proof, basically.  I designed this whole thing myself. Every valuable object in the Museum carries a small electronic chip.  If anything's moved so much as an inch, we get an alarm pinpointing the exact location of the attempted theft.
What doors?
I told you!  They seal off all the cells.  They were designed to fall automatically in a system failure --
D'Agosta?  Ippolito.  Come in.
I made it outside.  I'll co-ordinate the rescue efforts from here.  Help is on the way.  Just sit tight.
Who are you?  The undertaker?
Whose footprints?
What happened to them?
I don't like animals.  Never have. Dog bit me when I was little.  After that I gave up on pets.  Animals are irrational.  Give me a psychotic killer any day.  If there's one thing that makes me queasy it's being part of a food chain.  My first case as a rookie, two brothers climbed a fence at the zoo.  It was late August.  Over ninety.  The polar bear was inside his cave.  Kids didn't know he was in there.  All they saw was the pool. They got to swimming and splashing. The noise woke up the bear.  By the time I arrived, both little boys were in pieces.  The bear was dragging one kid around by the foot. I can still hear the mother screaming --
This isn't an animal, Vince.  I've been on this case four months, remember?  I've learned a few things.
I think I should come with you.
I smell it.  It's here.
Shouldn't a drug that powerful be destroyed?
Dr. Green has to see you!
What's that doing here?
Let me help.  I can take care of everything.
Yes it is.  I'm tired and I'm no longer needed --
With all due respect, dear, that's bull.  You dance rings around me with your new technology.  You've left me in the dust.
So the claw came from a huge creature with a preternatural sense of smell and poor eyesight that hunts at night.
What's that?
I have the species identification on these teeth.  We can extract DNA and start running tests on the extrapolator program.  Call Dr. Frock.  He wanted a demonstration.
That's impossible.
He was afraid of himself.  He tried suicide once.  He was ill.  Manic depressive.  He had wild emotional highs and lows.  Not a happy affliction for a scientist.  He'd been revered in our community.  By the end he was a joke.
I didn't imagine it.  I know what I saw.  Are you sure there are enough men in there?
All right.  This is hard for me.  I'm a scientist.  I like order and logic. Sometimes too much.  There's got to be an explanation.  There can't be an animal in there.  But I saw something.
You're not.  Where is it?
We have to try and draw it off!
That's a ptarmigan, feigning a broken wing.  The bird pretends to be injured to draw the fox away from its nest!
Welcome.
Of course, there hasn't been anything to compare with this - the first time an intruder has been a former cast member--
That and a fat, new contract.
Amnesia.
But recent events have been so dramatic, it does raise the perennial question. What keeps us watching this one man twenty-four hours a day - eating, sleeping, working, sitting for hours in contemplation?
But how do you account for the popularity of those eight hours a day when Truman sleeps?
Who are you?
Truman, I've watched you your whole life. I saw you take your first step, your first word, your first kiss.  I know you better than you know yourself.  You're not going to walk out that door--
It's not gonna be his, you idiot.
Oh, yes.
No...I, er.
It's beautiful!  What are you waiting for?
You really think it could've dropped off an airliner?
I'm onto something, Marlon - something big.
Just between you and me, Marlon, I'm going away for a while.
Not the whole thing, Truman.  You were right about one thing.
How do you know?
Are you listening to a word I'm saying?
Truman, that was our house!
I've changed my mind again.  What's New Orleans like this time of year?  Mardi Gras.  Or let's just see where the road takes us.
You're the one talking to the walls!
How's your hip?
They never found Dad's body--maybe somehow--
They're coming.  Any minute.
There's no one here.
See you tomorrow, Truman.
Do you live around here?
We don't even know you.
Well, we're FBI agents.
Poopy day?
What do you do?
Does what?
They gave you a craniotomy to relieve the pressure from a subdural hematoma. But you've been unconscious since they brought you in.
That the bombing in Dallas may have been to destroy the bodies of those firemen, so their deaths and the reason for them wouldn't have to be explained --
What is it you find incredible?
No, they don't.
Do you want me to destroy this one, too? Before it gestates?
Yes.
What's the question nobody's asking? Why that building? Why not the Federal Building?
Michaud was a twenty-two year veteran of the bureau --
You know my work?
You said the firemen and the boy were found in the temporary offices of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Why?
It was a deadly virus spread by field mice in the Southwest U.S. several years ago.
When we were young men in the military, your father and I were recruited for a project. They told us it was biological warfare. A virus. There were rumors about its origins.
What killed those men?
What killed them I won't even write about. I tell you, they'd do more than just harass me. They have the future to protect.
That would be my guess.
Scully...
Whatever you told them in there, you don't have to protect me.
They're trying to divide us on this, Scully. We can't let them.
Because they wanted me to invalidate your work, your investigations into the paranormal. But I think this goes deeper than that.
I wake you?
According to this tag.
And there's been no autopsy performed. There's no Y incision here; no internal exam.
I can't really talk right now.
How was it contracted?
Unmarked tanker trucks... what are archaeologists hauling out in tanker trucks?
Hey, I was right about the bomb, wasn't I?
They haul gas in tanker trucks, they haul oil in tanker trucks -- they don't haul viruses in tanker trucks.
You hear that?
What are you doing?
I'm contacting the state board Monday to file medical reinstatement papers --
Cold...
I can't go any farther.
-- They're asking her for a narrative. They want to know why she was in the wrong building.
But it's not the lives we saved. It's the lives we didn't.
-- if they want someone to blame, they can blame me. Agent Scully doesn't deserve this.
I know.  Agent Scully reported your suspicions to OPR. On the basis of her report, I sent techs over to S.A.C. Michaud's apartment. They picked up PSTN residues on his personal effects consistent with the construction of the vending machine device in Dallas.
We began to worry. Some of us have traveled so far, and you are the last to arrive.
In hope of what? Learning that it's true?! That we are nothing more than digestives for the creation of a new race of alien lifeforms?!
You need not kill a man to destroy him.
Why not?  Just once.  A trial run.  What harm could it do?
Miriam...
I'd be there for him.
Yes mother.
Henry wants me to try this Vietnamese place he's wild about.  Want to come?
I've got to feed my cat.  Besides, I want to get to bed early.
Sing a song of sixpence.
There's always a chance they'll confess.
This man is deeply disturbed, he...
You think you can do this, don't you?
He might tell me about Julia.  The part of him that wants to help, that feels shame and remorse.  Who wants to be redeemed.
Then what is he?
Little boy?!  That's him!
That went well.
Yep.  And guess who they hired to seal up the place?
That's why we monitor the use of the drugs so closely.  We don't want her getting to that degree of perceptual disorientation.
Prevacid.  For my stomach.
I am.  I'm a pretty boring guy.
Dr. Kent.
Awaiting his arrival.
Someone looking after her little girl?
I need it.
Now?
Here he is.
Thank you.
His own doctor?
Yes.
Anything really wrong with your papers?
Sssh. Don't. Don't, please.
Tell me more.
I'm going back home.
He liked to laugh.
Harry.
Here, it will be cold on that train.
His.
Oh, well.
...anyway?
Of course.
Nichts danke. Kein.
Right. Sit down Miss Schmidt, we will send your letters and things back to you.
Miss Schmidt, we know he is somewhere across the canal in the Russian sector... You may as well help us. In a few minutes Colonel Brodsky will be questioning you about your papers. Tell me where Lime is.
They'll be returned, miss.
Here we are. You'll be all right here, Miss.
Can you tell me whose...
Holly Martins.
"Death at the Double X Ranch" - Ra- a-nch.
...to him.
What are you trying to say?
...policemen. I have to call them sheriffs.
...expense.
What the devil?
And there was a third man there. I suppose that doesn't sound peculiar to you.
Well?...
It wouldn't work.
We'll never get him in the Russian zone.
A girl of spirit.
All right, Calloway. You win.
I never knew there were snake charmers in Texas...
Wait a minute - let me out.
Well, there's not much time.
Write her out a receipt, Paine. Give her a receipt for these letters too.
Get me Major Callaghan on the phone.
...his number.
It was just a soldier. I was trying to punch his major in the eye.
What about?
Mr. Holly Martins, sir.
Unwise, Holly...
We came out of his place like this, and were walking this way. A friend of his called to him from over there. Harry went across and from up there came the truck. It was just about here.
Well, there was only you, and this friend of his. Who is he?
What's the good of another post mortem? Suppose you dig up something - well - discreditable to Harry?
...your address?
...the best way one can, you know.
The Roumanian?
Mr. Popescu - Mr. Martins.
Already gone.
Oh, er - oh...was he - was he still alive?
The Roumanian?
I have no evidence. I saw nothing. I said nothing. It's not my business.
Help you out?
Thank you, sir. Thank you. I promise I will repay you.
Yea, OK. I will be, I will be, I promise.
So how many miles do you think it is?
Bonsoir.
Francoise -
So there's an urban myth, well more of a rural myth, going around here at the moment. It's about a beach.
I rest my case. He's a Jewish Nazi. He always was.
Bring your friends.... We're not his friends.
Yes.
Yeah. He's a respected scholar. Even No-am Chomsky says he --
What do you care?
You're a Jew. Maybe you don't realize it, but you are.
Too Christian. You know Jameson? Paul Virilio?
Why no silencer?
"...<i>und die Worte zerfielen mir im Munde wie modrige Pilze</i>..."
He's in a mental institution.... He's been there for ten years, off and on. Mostly on.
Why won't you talk to me?
How come there's no punctuation?
Do you know it like that? By heart.
Oh, yeah... 
Put something on. You're not supposed to be naked in front of it.
See, the Jews love to separate things: the holy from the profane, milk from meat, wool from linen, the Sabbath from the week, the Jew from the gentile.... As if one little scrap of this was going to completely contaminate that.
What's it about?
Why should I submit?
He commands it whether He exists or not...  Look, we can fight him and be crushed. Or we can submit.
Carla?... It's me, Danny...Danny Balint...? We met at that...[meeting at your house.]
I didn't notice his shoes.... Did your mother know he was there?
More cultural than political.
They used to. Today it's not an issue.
What about...Manzetti, the synagogues....
Is it okay if I record this?
The Jews are different.... Blacks are disgusting and inferior, but it's like criticizing a retarded child. The Jews are...a poison in the human well....
Let me give you an example.... Sexuality.
He says you were bar mitzvahed there, in March 1988.
Why would Nadelman lie?
But if the Jews are strengthened by hate, wouldn't this "destruction" you speak of -- by love or by any other means -- in fact make them more powerful than they are already?
Two days ago you addressed a Nazi rally. Last week you went to a Torah study group.
What were you, following me?
I don't think you know what you are.
I thought you hated Torah.
Which <i>Times</i> guy?
And only talked about killing Manzetti to convince them you were an anti-Semite. If you'd had any idea somebody would take it seriously, you never would have said it.
That's meat.
But you already talked about it: you said it's not stupid. Why isn't it stupid?
Steve...
Is this because of those kids who used to beat you up?
The Polacks? From Sacred Heart?
Isn't it true?
Didn't you get anything?
Are you an artist?
Why me?
How did you know they were Jews?
I'm a bad shot. I don't think I can --
EAT SHIT, ASSHOLES....
What do you mean?
You're going to live here permanently?
But your man isn't quite a God!
Probably not, but I still don't have the nerve to tell him.
You're leaving?
Johana, am I boring you?
We have to send somebody over there immediately!  If we prove the forgery we can cancel the policy. We'll be off the hook.  There's a flight to Rome in two hours and from there its just a short hop to Sicily.
Will that interfere with my getting maternity leave?  I'm pregnant.
He seems to have won it.
He looks strange, doesn't he? Like a baby that just learned to walk.
... That's what he's here for, isn't he?
Congratulations, Enzo.
Jacques!  Johana!
How did it happen?
Dollars.
Is he here?
It isn't lit yet.
And... does the voice come back?
You're the best, Enzo!
No, no!
Your mother?
No.
No, I have to ask you a favor...  You're the only one who'll understand.
He doesn't like us.
... Yes.
I've had many... when the sea doesn't want you.
You say that because you have the title!
You were right.
Yeah... Sure... Is this your first trip to Peru?
But what brought you to Sicily?
Thank you...
Why?
I'm being a pain, huh?
Bonjour Monsieur... Louis. 
I didn't dive.
Why don't you ask me?
It's my apartment.
Again?
I'll have to talk to the driver.
Will he understand Spanish?
Okay, okay.  You'll have it by the end of the week, how's that?
Looks like I got a plane to catch.
What!?
I want you to talk dirty to me.
Shabat Shalom mama. I brought some Manischewitz. The black label.
Mordechai. Do you love your mother?
Let's let your tuchus breathe.
Mom! We're eating!
Okay, what's the information?
So Morde-chai, tell me, what brings your bad self down to the KLF?
Okay, look. I'm going to work really, really hard on this one. But, please stop with the pressure. I'm already tense as it is.
Wait! Before we enter, you need to know that my research has determined that Santa's compound is wired with the XP 2000 stereo type alarm system.
So, what's our first plan of attack Santa?
So what's in the boxes? Heroin? Cocaine?
So, how was I?
What day is it?
I can't understand that fancy talk.  You mean I'm a gold-digger? Sure, I'm a gold-digger -- why not?
They don't say it to me.
I want him to lock me up.
What's left of him.
Well -- did he give you a lot of money?
Something black —- something on its way to you ——
Pedro is waiting for me, too.
Oh, that's so interesting!
Sure -- certainly —- but what's that got to do with this?
But it doesn't eat what it kills.
Come to look around?
If there were a man like that, with a kink in his brain around here loose, what would he be like.
He'd act normally when he was with other people. It would be a man who suffered remorse and even pity when it was all over.
It was you, Galbraith!
I didn't do anything. She screamed. Something frightened her.
Consuelo screamed too -- and Clo Clo. Why did you do it? Why? Quick. Tell me why?
So you see meeting you is a real thrill for me.
Something's wrong with this whole setup --
What are you getting at?
Why?
You think Galbraith found the leopard on the day you went out with the posse.
That's a fact, isn't it?
Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this tine...
On his back, I suppose.
No —- not yet.
You look swell in that three—alarm number --
I know. What do you think I felt when you said, "don't be soft?"
Ain’t nobody out there, Mister.
That’s right.
Will you please come with me?
That might depend on where you’re going.
Can it be that easy?
Disney! How inter...
How dare you...  You don’t know this tape belongs to my brother, do you, Mr Lombard?
Thank you for coming. Come in and close the door, will you?
Have you got a pen?
Mr Lombard. Mrs De Moraes...
When did you get back?
You’re mad...
Why did you send me after Friedman? To atone for your sins?
Is there anything to understand?
Something like that.
Here we go again.
Where is that?
Perhaps it came to me while dying in a Californian desert because a woman set upon giving her husband a fright got slapped about a little.
The staff don’t know yet...  I called my parents, told them everything...  I just couldn’t take any more...
So you did talk about it, huh?
Why the hell couldn’t you divorce the man?
I... We have to bury Leon tommorrow...
A call box? That’s odd. Where exactly?
Good morning, sir. How can I help you?
Where were you staying before the attempt on your life and why can’t you go back there?
The Mondrian, room 504. I was checked out in my absence.
A recent acquisition. We’ve had four break- ins this year alone; files stolen, computers wrecked, faeces smeared on walls. The good guys dismiss us as alarmist do-gooders; the bad guys will risk prison to intimidate and rob us. An easy living indeed, Mr Lombard.  I got through to Moreau and Jane. I left your landlord out of it. Your flat’s been broken into. Jane wants you to call her back.
Call from the motel and tell him if he moves fast enough there might be something left of a body dissolving in acid.  Can I have the keys to your house?
Shit! Fuck! What’s fucking wrong with people!  I’m going to bed. And sweet dreams to you to! 
What sort of puppy are you looking for?
What about an untrained pup, white...
I don’t know. He’s gone!  He’s gone. I don’t fucking know where, I swear... He’s gone. On holiday...
Who’s the money man?
Does Mr Gluck call for his messages?
Next time he calls tell Mr Gluck he better be there to take his calls at 9 tonight or at 9 in the morning if he cares about his puppies. Got that?
Jane, there was an envelope in my desk. The one I’d given you and then got back, remember? I can’t find it. Do you know where it is?
Carlos De Moraes?
Good afternoon, Mrs...?
You wouldn’t be here if I knew, Mr Lombard. What I do know is that he has not been at work for three weeks. That enquiries to the police and London hospitals have borne no results. And that a check with his bank revealed he has not used his account for four weeks now.
I take it your son is not married, Mrs Spitz?
Am I supposed to know him?
Clients come and go.
You’re out of your mind. What’s the idea?
Huh. I’d have thought a tough guy like you would know better. The sick ones are out there, friend. They make up the clientèle. Get rid of them and we’re out of business.
You seem very sure about that.
What is?
Trying to say something, Martin?
At what time will you be available?
What are you talking about?
I gather we’ve done business with a friend of yours?
And while visiting our fair city you...  An Austrian?
Can I get up now?
His mother would be pleased to hear that.
Yeah... But he didn’t beat the demons...  A quarter of all the shoes sold in Europe are made by or retailed through his parent’s leather empire. All started from a small shop in the East End of London and war reparation money for holocaust victims.
No sick people in the country, huh?... Just tell me one thing, Rhian. Leon’s story about the boy? You just took his word for it?
What’s the date?
Fine...
Los Angeles?
Barstow’s 30 miles to the left. Los Angeles a hundred to the right. Wherever you’re heading, I reckon somebody’ll pick you up.
Small, blond, good-looking. She was with him when we met. She had a funny English accent.
Why did you kill Friedman?
If he had, you’d be dead.
What do you think, huh?
Not even scum like Friedman would go to the trouble of killing a stranger on the strength of one anonymous call.
Their last suspected kill occurred two years back, though your Spitzes now probably do no more than bankroll the group. Still, I’d watch my step. These people are well-connected, Laurent; former Israeli prime minister, etc. The lady’s also president of an international Zionist organisation... Anyway, you get the picture.
What do you think?
Here... to help pay Jeanne's ransom. All the Captains gave what they could, as well as the citizens of Orleans and the other towns she saved...
What do you fear most now... my sword?  ... or his hands?
I thought you were an archer?
Jeanne, calm down.  You can't blame the people -- they've been hearing all about you for weeks.
What... what do you mean?
It's been weeks since they spoke to me.  Since the coronation... no signs... nothing...
Well of course they're me!  That's how God talks to me.  If you listen hard enough, even you can hear him. Everyone can hear him.
It's a trap!  They're buying time till they can bring over more soldiers from England!
Did your voices tell you that?  You told me you hadn't heard them for months...
One day you will.
And didn't you order the citizens of Paris to surrender the city in the name of the King of Heaven?
Ah, yes, I forgot... God sent us an illiterate peasant to carry out such an important mission!  Do you think that God made the right decision, to take an ignorant girl to save the kingdom of France?
And so I... I prefer my banner.
And when was that?
To hell with procedure!  We paid a bloody fortune for this slut, and we can do whatever the hell we like with her, whether the church likes it or not -- is that clear?
Be patient, my lord... you've seen how it is.  This girl has a way with people... but everyday we're making progress...
Oh, thank you Lord!  I'm so glad to see you!  I need to confess... I haven't been confessed since Easter... or been to Mass... Will you hear me now?
I will hear you... but not now, not here.
Trial?  What trial??
So... begin by telling us your name -- assuming you're allowed to tell us that much?
And may I go to Mass?
Good day, sir.  I trust my honorable Duke of Burgundy is feeling well?
Your health and happiness has always been my first concern, Charles... ever since you were a little boy -- and I think I know you better than your own mother...
Gave you?  Well now, I wouldn't quite put it like that...
My astrologers assure me that the hour is p-p-propitious -- Leo, with Virgo rising.  Have you ever noticed on the astrological chart how the Virgin is next to the Lion?
Supposing she's an assassin?
Your majesty, I really think you...
There's no time, sire -- we can't hold up the ceremony... there's no telling when the English might come back... they're only ten leagues away...
I... I don't know... it'll sound like we... betrayed her...?
I'm more interested in what he says, not what he looks like.
Go on to the next question.
That's not a lot.
Because... because -- I mean -- the English have a broad sense of humor, but... I mean, you don't understand... to them you're a witch, working for the devil.  What makes you think they'll listen to you?
Dunois... was it you who ordered the attack?  Answer me?!
Stand by with the battering-rams...
My lord Dunois... I have wonderful news! -- finally -- he's sending her to us -- thanks be to God -- we're saved -- it's wonderful!
Calm yourself, Xaintrailles.  Now slowly.  Who has finally done what?
There must be something we can do for her for Chrissakes!
Yes.  We can pray.
And... what does Jeanne think?
Bravo!  What about all the other hundreds of prisoners?  Do we let them go too?
Do you know how to count?
But you can't just kill a man for his teeth!
We... won?!
Yes... a half-steed... white.
WHO ARE YOU TO DECIDE IF YOU SHOULD LIVE OR DIE?
My... visions...
Because!  Because I've always been faithful to God, and I've followed everything he said... and I've done everything he asked me...
But... it didn't just get there by itself.
No, no, you did fine.  I'd even say well done.  Besides, most of the ones you killed probably deserved it, don't you think?
I don't agree.  Why do you have to keep changing your mind all the time?
Why are you doing this to me??  Do you get pleasure from hurting me?
I -- I cleaned up my room, look... and I said my prayers... all of them... and...
What are you doing on the wall?
You know what you just signed, Jeanne?  You just signed away my existence... For you I'm a lie, an illusion.  You see?  In the end, you were the one who abandoned me...
You think you are ready now?
Whose were they?
Yes, it is.
Well, I try and talk to him, but mostly he's the one who does the talking.
I know Jesus says to love our enemies but I can't -- I just want the English to burn in hell for ever and ever!
I want to be with him always...
Why are you here, Mr. Wladek?
A singer. Her husband's an actor. I knew them well. Good people. I'd like to talk to her.
This is my husband. Wladyslaw Szpilman. Marek Gebczynski sent him.
Oh, Mr Szpilman, you're quite... quite wonderful.
Dorota.
Where do you want me to go?  Look at me. No, no, I'm not leaving. Can't I take my chances here?
Funny time to say this.
Oh, you need me now, yes, now you need me!
It costs.
Mama, that was a great dinner.
You sell anything?
Just one. Dostoevsky. The Idiot. Three zlotys.
I can look after myself!
No, I'm a socialist. I have brothers everywhere. They bring me news and food. We care about our fellow human beings. Workers of the world unite.
You're an artist, Wladek, you keep people's spirits up. You do enough.
There are notices going up. The city's to be cleansed of undesirables.
Yes, I know, but Jurek, Jurek...
Cow!
I tried your friends. They're not at that address any more.  But.
No, no, no, I'm staying put. If I'm going to die, I prefer to die at home.
I was... I was trying to open this tin.
Ohhh, it's so dark, it's like a dank cave.
What would you think if someone played a kitchen table like it were a piano?
I thought she met your father in Luxemburg.
Which mountains are those dear?
I got the good wife for you Peini. She pray good. Clean. Read Bible. You sleep her Peini. She chief daughter.
Yes, I thought that.
You have to wash them.
He says you're not to see her or he'll chop her up!
What?
Hello, then.
I know why Mr. Baines can't play the piano.
And when is the next lesson?
You the owner here?
Lieutenant Snyder.  Bunco.
Then why ain't he dead?
Straight north.  He was gonna take it all and run.
There's always a depression on.
Doyle, can I see you a minute?
I don't know.  Could be.  We're runnin' that down now.
Combs gave it to Reilly and Cole.
I know I give him four threes.  We can't let him get away with that.
Does J.J. know how to use this thing?
Glad to meet ya, kid.  You're a real horse's ass.
Aw, I conned a Senator from Florida on a stocks deal.  A real lop-ear. He thought he was gonna take over General Electric.  Some Chantoozie woke him up, though, and he put the feds on me.
I'll take him anyway.
I never played for winos.
How'd ya do?
And?
You know how easy it'd be for one of Lonnegan's guys to nail you?
Not enough to cover a bet that big.
What's the problem?
I'm not sure I know it.
You in?
He usually plays with a Royal or a Cadenza.  I got you one of each.  He likes to cold deck low, 8's or 9's.
See ya and raise three.
How do I know you're tellin' the truth.
Hi there, Snyder.  Things a little slow down at the Bunco Department tonight, eh?  Somebody lose the dominoes?
You sure it'll be one of these two?
Aw, come on, Hooker, why don't you just...
Your boss is quite a card player, Carver.  How does he do it?
What do you mean?
You were set up, Lonnegan.  Shaw's been planning to beat your game for months.  He was just waiting for you to cheat him so he could clip ya.
Get on with it then.
You stayin' in or not?
I think we oughta place another bet tomorrow.
A week's a long time, friend. Anything can happen.  All of it bad.
What happened?
I'll make parole.
Will you wait until the chump is played?
But who says you will.  I got a guy I can depend on.  He's liquidating everything he has for this.  You wouldn't even give Carver his money back.
I need more proof, that's all. Anybody can get lucky once.
Yeh, and what does Cole say about that?
Well we do.  He's chummin' around with a Big C named Henry Gondorff. Ring any bells?
Cause the stoolies are used to street dicks jumpin' him.  If word gets around that Feds are in on it too, Gondorff'll fold up the whole thing.
Have the police got any idea where Wynant is?
Yes.  He admitted it.
Sexogerarian, eh?  Yes.  Yes.  But I can't put that in the paper.
What?
I can't help it.  You don't know.....
Do you think I care
You just want money -- and you haven't any right to any more.  He made a big settlement on you.
Oh!
Mother!
Yes.
Yes.
tried him once -
Your father?
Come on in.
You heard about Julia Wolf?
I don't know.
Don't lie to me.
Hello, Dorothy. 
Forgive me.  How are you?
You see how much we have to say.
It's a promise?
Better get home before it is.
Not without a warrant.
Who's is it?
You oughtn't to play this trick on me.  Running out when I was giving you time to rest up before I asked you those questions.
Man to man, Mr. Charles, are you working on this case?
Who's your candidate?
Fifty will still get you a hundred.
Well, what?
About three.
Do you know what they fought about that night he went away?
What are you going to do?
and there she was lying dead.  The police said she'd probably been killed about ten minutes before I got there.
We're just having a little drink.
Who's that man?
The government bonds.  The ones you took from the office safe.
Go ahead!
Is there a Mr. Macaulay in the house?  Oh, it's you.
She usually is.  Trying one way or another to get money out of Wynant. I wanted to find out if you were er - er -  --sleuthing for her.
What's all the fuss about? Is he in hiding?
No word at all?
How are you?
What are the chances of getting you to do what he wants?
What do you think?
I'm lot going to stay here to be insulted - 
Why do you say that?
I'd better order some food.  That sounds like an interesting case.  Wouldn't you like to take it?
No.
No thanks.
I think I would like that drink.  I'll give you your Christmas present now if you'll give me mine.
There's one coming.
I wish that doctor'd come.  How do you feel?
He's got more sense than you have. Thank Heaven you're not on this case.
Who gave it to you?
Let's see.  Where's it from?
You talk as if I were Asta.
This may be a little rough - you'd better let us go alone.
Looks like a hold-up!
I've got hunch.  I'm going down to look at Wynant's shop, I want to find out why it's closed.
You dog!
He was down in the shop.
I can't help it. I can't tell a soul.  I didn't even tell Guild.
Got a nice evening dress?
Who do you think did it?
Yes, sir.  Julia Wolf got me a job as bookkeeper.
Was he a good detective?
Bonds, sir?
Paper.
A casual one.
Damn, this is sweet.  We are going to be home in no time.
Not much chance of that.  Jaeger's an idiot.
He's not so--
What if it's a Valloro 69?  Just going to bounce right up out of the ground, explode in the air, kill him and us.
Should be easy going from here.  Stay on the pass straight to the dot.
Says he wanted food.  Liar.  He wanted the gold.
You said he was a deserter.
Then step aside.
Then I suppose it'd be insurrection, and I suppose I'd have to kill you.  I suppose.
Wes, we thought you were dead, and we thought we were next.  Hanging around to get killed wouldn't have done anyone any good.
I have to answer him.
This is stupid.  It's going on a month now.  How long are they going to let the Air Force piss on those bastards?  They can bomb them all they want, Saddam ain't going anywhere without a ground assault. What the hell is the army waiting for?
Everybody's got a job to do.  Figure it this way:  At least you get to go home alive.
Don't even.  You're not going to show me that tired map.
It's going to be cool, Wes.  It's all all right.
Invest it.
And I'm talking about enjoying myself.
Shut up!  Both of you shut the hell up!
What?
I'm gonna...I'm just gonna stop for a little water.
How'm I gonna relax standing on a mine!?
How's this going to work?
When we start running suck up your breath.  You're going to get the wind knocked out of you.
Wes might be right about that.
There's another pass on the photo.  We can avoid that narrow one we had to cross on the way up, and it should get us back down.
What are we going to do?  How are we going to find our way back!?
We'll lie.
First Wes, now you?
You still got a map on you?
Yeah.
Makes two of us.
I know what I did just now was crazy, but you got to understand how much I want that gold.
Just let me rest for a second.
You know what I'm going to do?  I'm just going to take a second.  I want to look at the gold.
I just want to look at it.  Remind me of what I'm dying for.
What do you figure it is?
Place all alone like that?  Must be a boarder check point.
That's if the war is even still going on. Way things were shaping up it's probably long over.
I...I never killed anyone before.  I told you that.
An Iraqi?
The...the gold...
When did you make the switch?
Thought you were going to buy a car.
Australia.
Hey, Jaeger.  What's up.
Just...want to be ready when we do.
We ought to kick their asses anyway. Even if they do get out of Kuwait we ought to kick their asses.
I'm saying don't do it accidently.
It was an accident.  You saw it was an accident.
We're not going anywhere.  Not 'til we get what we came for.
So, you just let us drive on knowing we were losing fuel?  Knowing we were going to run low in the middle of nowhere?
You two don't even know how crazy you are.  You want to go on your sick, little treasure hunt then go ahead, but mark me absent.
Epps...
Haven't found a mine for half a mile, or more.
You're the one wanted to kill Iraqis so bad.
Maybe we ought to...you know, bury him. Say some words over him.
4000 degrees is usually the point of....?
He wants me to come to his quarters.
Then why did you bring it up?
I haven't done anything.
I've never been under the table before.
No....I though  I'm afraid.
Then what?  It can't go on forever. You know it can't.
They don't know.
They're watching us now.
It's the end.
I'm not afraid...I'm not afraid.
There goes another of your disciples.
THX and me.
What are you doing here?  You're not cleared for this area!
Listen to me....You have no need to distrust me.  We're going....
When?.....How?
What?
...and you're not lost now?
We'll never make it through that mainway...I wonder what happened to SEN.  I'm crazy!  This whole thing is crazy...What am I doing?  My mind is full of so many things I can't think of anything, anymore.  Who are you?
I knew him.
Yes...
Aren't you on suspension?
Who the heck're you?
This isn't bumper cars, it's brain surgery. You wanna work with us, you do it our way, understand?
I don't know. You tell me?
Top of my class at West Point, thank you very much. Then off to Redstone. First half of the course we learned how to build devices... second half, we'd take them apart. Everything from firecrackers to hydrogen bombs.
What?
Your partner?
It's working.
Something round, two wires ...
Then why tell me?
What the hell was that?
What about the ballistics report?
Pooch, can you move it?
So what'll you do? After they give you the gold watch.
So what're we looking for?
Captain...
What's this?
Reilly, what the hell are you-?
So you lost a handbag, madame?
Tell M'sieu Giron I can't see him now. Impossible!  And, Jacques. Dismiss the car! Madame is not going. 
Yes, M'sieu Filiba?
You've <u>never</u> been in Venice?
And harems ... ?
Umm.
The type they marry.
Yes, sir?  What shall we start with, Baron?
Oh, yes ... Well, that's not so easy.  Beginnings are always difficult.
It must be the most marvelous supper. We may not eat it, but it must be marvelous.
You're not safe anywhere nowadays.
But please, Baron. We're not supposed to breathe a word of it. You won't tell anybody I told you?
I was only asking if you are related to the Lavals of Marseilles.
And I was only asking you if you would let me examine your report without interruption.
Right now! It's very important, M'sieu Laval.
Then why didn't you call the police? Why <u>don't</u> you call the police?  I'll tell you why--you crook, you.
Monescu.
The tennis player?
Do you <u>know</u> King Boris?
You'd better not. He's really very dull. But anyhow, when the king tells the marquis he saw me, the marquis will tell the marchesa. And the marchesa is the best friend of the Duchess of Chambro. And <u>she</u> will phone the Princess de Costa. The princess doesn't like me--but I don't care!
Gaston Monescu.
And take the twenty thousand francs ...
And we'll celebrate the second anniversary of the day we didn't get married!
Hello ... Is this the Spanish consulate? This is Doña Ignacio Fernandez.  My husband and I are leaving tonight for Berlin ... Is it too late to get a visa this afternoon ... ? Thank you, thank you.  How long will it take you?
Well, see you at the Berlin Express.
Yes, <u>M'sieu</u> <u>Colet</u>?
You <u>have</u> to get out of here!
That's what I'm here for--to get out! I want to get away from here, from you--as fast as I can and as far as a hundred thousand francs will take me.  Sixty-five, ninety-four--
Yes...?
Then you go into the foyer.
Not in the least, madame. But you see, it's a very expensive bag--one has to be careful.
That's too dark.
Do you know my first name?
Make it out to cash!
And how I handle my <u>money</u>!
The same thing.
Yes, madame?
Talk? About me--about us?
Precisely.
Yes, I would!
And you're going to fall for them.
Any minute I want!
<u>Now</u>, <u>let</u> <u>me</u> <u>tell</u> <u>you</u>--
<u>I</u> <u>love</u> <u>you</u>.
Yes, Gaston?
And you expect me to believe that?
Divine ...
Well, in times like these most people are cutting salaries, but suppose we say, in your case, three hundred and fifty?
Let me give you a little advice. When you embrace him, be sure to put on your gloves. It would be too bad if your fingerprints were found ...
That's right.
Your ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews. Truly.
No! I'll do this with or without your help, sir. But without will take longer.
Stay off the floor. Don't stir it up like you did yesterday.
So let me get this right. You were gonna kill yourself by jumping off the Titanic?  That's great!
The partners want to know how it's going?
She's not on the starboard side either.
Your daughter is much too hard to impress, Ruth.  Mind your step.
You're wrong. They're fascinating. Like in a dream... there's truth without logic. What's his name again...?  Picasso.
Something serious has happened.
But I was with him the whole time.
What do I tell your mother?
What sorry? What you got? You lose my money?? Ma va fa'n culo testa di cazzo --
Captain, the press knows the size of Titanic, let them marvel at her speed too. We must give them something new to print. And the maiden voyage of Titanic must make headlines!
Sorry. Just... you look like kind of an indoor girl. Anyway, I went through some thin ice and I'm tellin' ya, water that cold... like that right down there... it hits you like a thousand knives all over your body. You can't breath, you can't think... least not about anything but the pain.  Which is why I'm not looking forward to jumping in after you. But like I said, I don't see a choice. I guess I'm kinda hoping you'll come back over the rail and get me off the hook here.
If only it were that simple.
You have a gift, Jack. You do. You see people.
Rose, you're no picnic... you're a spoiled little brat even, but under that you're a strong, pure heart, and you're the most amazingly astounding girl I've ever known and --
Fabrizio said you might be up --
Are you nervous?
When this ship docks, I'm getting off with you.
We have to tell Mother and Cal.
Come with me, Jack. I jump, you jump... Right?
I know, I know.
So... how did you find out I didn't do it?
You jump, I jump, right?
Never let go.
Yes, like a mill pond. Not a breath of wind.
Wait! Can you give us something go on, here. Like who had access to the safe. What about this Lovejoy guy? The valet. Did he have the combination?
Do you want the truth, Anya?
I had an idea your husband was getting suspicious.
Sure!
So that's your little dancer that you were playing around with in New York.  Oh--there's no accounting for tastes--  Mine, too, seem to be in the gutter.
Oh--a hundred times--
Feeling a little better, I see.
Sorry I can't return the compliment.
What did you want a gun for?
Stick-up. Needed dough to get ashore.
You're coming back--
I'm so sorry!
I'd <U>like</U> to be.  Sailing on the <U>Progress?</U>
Don't thank me. Do you recognize me without the lipstick?
This is great. I'll be able to watch your act every night.
Never eat before the show.
What a horrible death! Do you know what you remind me of?
Don't rub it in.
Sally--!
Would you like to take a turn around the deck with me?
He's a colored man in chauffeur's uniform carrying a basket of fruit.
--there's thousands of 'em!
Maybe she's in the show--One of the troupers--did you ever think of that?
Just a minute, steward--haven't you forgotten something?
Change?
Thank you.  I owe you a dollar forty--here--keep the change.
Your mother is feeling seasick and would like to see you right away.
Say--wait a minute!
It's your deal.
That goes two ways.
Care to join us?
I'll go with you.
Wouldn't bet against her.  Tell you what I will do--bet you I find that bracelet before we hit France.  Not a hundred, though--just fifty.
Your wife knows that, don't she?
Sure.
Your wife knows that, don't she?
Not yet.  Say, where is this boat headed for?
This is a fine time to be asking that. You're on your way to France.
McKinney's the name.
He's a likable chap--he's got an honest face--
Hello, Inspector--I hear your vacation's been spoiled. Somebody lost a bracelet.
Yes, a bracelet's been lost, but I'm still on my vacation.
Well, that's something--even if only the fish can see it.
Still got my picture, I see--I was pretty dumb then, wasn't I, Chad?
Do what--
Women are such fools!--Why do so many of us pass up <U>right</U> guys?
What do you mean?
But, Mary--everybody's having such a great time-- why spoil it?
I'm getting seasick--
All right--don't spoil the trip with any of those jokes-- there's a nice bunch of people on this trip--nothing but class--I looked over the passenger list and they're all members of the Who's Who!
Never mind the Who's Who--Before I get on this boat I want to know What's What! How about my raise? All I get out of these ocean trips is dizzy.
Eh?... Oh.
The country boy's about due.
Go ahead--you didn't used to be so fussy--
Why should <U>I</U> kill him?
"Smooth's" the word.
What's the matter?
I'm all right.
Let me look at it.
God damn son of a...
Oh, my God...
The man dealing faro.  Who is he?
Not now.  I don't have time.
I saw that look pass between you And Wyatt at the fight.  Listen to Me!  You're mine!  Understand? You're my woman and I'm your man.
I'm retired.
Come on, you...
Fair enough.  You know I got to Admit, you got a lot of bark on You comin' up here like this.
Age quod agis.
On three?  You call it.
Here, Doc.
I calculate that's the end of This town.  And let's don't bother About the luggage, darling.
Not exactly...
I'm a good woman to you, Doc. Don't I always take care of you? Nobody cares for you like me.  I'm A good woman.
Very instructive
You know damn well who I mean. That dusky-hued lady Satan.
I don't know.  Probably ignore her.
Ignore her?
I'd ignore her.  People can Change, Doc.
Satisfied?
I'm a man without fear, Wyatt.  I Literally don't care if I live or Die.  But even I can't fight human Instinct.  Somebody suddenly Starts shooting at me, I duck. But you... what on earth were You thinking about?
What makes a man like Ringo, Doc? What makes him do the things he does?
What does he want?  He wants revenge.
Well hell, Wyatt.  Wyatt, I want You to meet Father Feeney.  Father Feeney's just been initiating me Into the mysteries of the great And ancient Church of Rome.  You See, it appears my hypocrisy Knows no bounds.
How you feelin', Doc?
Hurts.  Hurts pretty bad.
All right, Doc...
When will you wake up?  You Wouldn't know a normal life if it Bit you in the ass.
I played the cards I was dealt, Wyatt.  Your problem is you're Always trying to play someone Else's.  Allow me to tell you the Truth and thus set you free: There is no happiness, Wyatt There is no normal life.  There's Only life, that's all.  Just life. The rest is relative.
Drunks.  Crawfished a bet, called Him a liar.  I saw the whole thing.
Not half as bad as I feel.
We're the law, ain't we?  Well the Law don't ride around vermin-
Easy now... That mare's in season.
Just answer.
Doesn't suit you.
Just doesn't, that's all.
I must say this certainly has Been an unexpected little Windfall.
I didn't mean it that way.
I have to go.
Long as I live I'll never Get used to that sound.
Honey, I gotta start makin' money.
I don't know.  I'm all right.
You're a Cowboy, you're a Brother.  Come back, no hard Feelings.
Isn't there anything I can say That'll change your mind?  You're Gonna stay with your new friends?
McMasters, isn't it?  Listen, you Seen a black stallion with-
I don't like it.
It's that woman from the coach!
Hey Doc!  Come on now.
For a man that don't go heeled You run your mouth kinda reckless.
Allie-girl...And Louisa!  You're So lovely.  I'm at your feet, Darlin'.  Just at your feet.  Guess it's only right.  Ma always Said you were the prettiest.
Keep your eye on that brass ring. Don't let anything side-track you.
Pretty fun too, isn't it?
Maybe I jumped the gun.  Maybe Those Cowboys aren't near as bad As they're painted.  You know I Was thinkin', there's a lot of Money in the cattle business...
Here they are again.  Look at 'em.
Wyatt, they're threatening our lives.
Wyatt, I know what I'm doin'.
Why don't you just leave it alone?
No, I gotta do something.  I don't Suppose you'd card-
Why wasn't the ship protected?!?! Why was it sailing without radar?
Which part? The Colonel's? Or yours?
Or disinformation... If you wanted to, say, beam down a signal to send a ship off course? Maybe one degree a minute?
Precisely, Mr. Bond. In a matter of minutes, the boring device will arrive at the core of the reactor...  And when the radioactive blades cut into the plutonium -
I know. Pirates from Sumatra want the cargo; smugglers from Thailand and Burma want the ships.
The Kuala Lumpur ferry was 35 miles off-course that night. Captain blamed the auto-pilot; I suspected he was drunk - until the Sumatra ferry captain had same problem.
Yes -
Yes. The famous James Bond. I've heard all about you, sir. You were under direct orders to act as an observer - and yet you had to go off, on your own, like some half-assed CIA cowboy -  Endangering the gold, attracting that lunatic woman, and then putting in a distress call for us to save your bloody hide.
Oh, James. I've missed you -
Leave me alone! He's going to kill me!!
Okay, Saunders. What is it this time? Rocket in the leg? Machine pistol in the arm?
Yeah. Russian Minister of Transportation.
She married a hockey player.
I have to get these to London. Do you know this Captain Cheong?
Spends his nights at the Kuala Lumpur yacht club.
I got you covered.
Sidney Winch, meet -
Interesting presentation.
Three. You? Married?
Boyfriend?
Insurance. Lloyds of London.
Do I have to do everything around here?
Why don't we just take these -
Another reason??? Did I miss something???
If it's radio controlled, it'll break the code.
... Yes?
Tell me, 007, what do you know about Elliot Harmsway?
You're to wear this mask at the Venice Carnival, and wait to be contacted.
...I'll give you a ring from Venice.
Hmmm. I suppose this is a step above that profession.  Ten seconds. Are you leaving?
The American presidential candidate called to complain about that sex story -
What is HE doing here?
Take the men. I can finish alone.
Is the helicopter ready?
Fueled and waiting.
It's a trick! After him.  They're in the south stairwell!
They're on the bridge. Seal off the 50th floor!
I regret to inform you, sir, that Saddam Hussein is still demanding a bonus for his role in the Gulf War.
Please sir. Please -
Yes.
I told her I would if she would give me time.
I bet you if your master would have told you to fix the hole in the roof, you would have rebuilt the whole damn house.
My daddy never gave me anything without my having to sweat for it. Every summer, the way they kept me and Junior out of trouble was to send us to Big Daddy's farm. We would get up with the chickens. Every summer the fence had to be repaired. The barn needed a coat of paint. We had to pip all of Big Mama's hundred laying hens and go to church all day on Sunday. For Big Daddy, calluses and sweat were the mark of a man. Sunny will never have to bust his knuckles like we did.
I want Sunny to have an advantage that you and I never had, but he needs discipline, and you are not helping when I tell him to do something and you allow him to get out of it.
Will you still get the money from your father?
Pops put Big Daddy's farm in Rhonda's and Sunny's name and fixed it so no one can borrow on it.
Like a veil has been lifted?
Like muddy waters?
I was hoping you came to the door instead of him. It gets cold at night.
I'm going back home with Harry.
Did you ever have to use this thing?
What is that?
You know it is against the city ordinance to keep chickens or live stock.
I always had chickens, ducks and whatnots.
Hush.
I was going to get up and get a hen out there for dinner, but time got away.
How often is your wife called to help delivery?
My daddy called me boy up to the time he died. I was always boy to him.
What's the problem here?
Ah, you young folks don't know how it is. How is Gideon today?
He has never gotten rid of the malaria. He is usually up and at it the next day. I'm going to make him fresh chicken broth.
Hattie is a different person now.
Now who are we talking about?
Week by week the crowds at the door keeps getting larger. We can't feed all the hungry.
None of your business.
I think he wants to see your rabbit foot.
No, but I might have some Indian Chief Tonic.
You know Okra asked me to marry him the other evening.
He's just raffish. Harry put him up to it. Before evening sun sets, I would have his belongings back on Route 55, that old fox.
Counting the what? What does that have to do with the price of butter?
Whadda ya think?
Can I bring some toys?
Andy!  I'm heading out the door.
Oh, I'm sure he's there.  You're just not looking hard enough.
Hey!  Wow!
Aach! -- Oh, hi, Bo.
Toy?
They are a terillium-carbonic alloy and I CAN fly.
Can!
Don't even think about it, cowboy!
I could have stopped him.
My fault?!  If you hadn't pushed me out of the window in the first place --
You mean it has hyperdrive?
I sure hope this isn't permanent.
Yeah, right.
Ahhh!! This is the part where we blow up!
Hey, Buzz!!  You're flying!!
Well, that MISTAKE is sitting in your spot, Woody.
Laser-envy.
Wait a minute.  You -- you don't think I meant to knock Buzz out the window, do you Potato Head?
No wait!  You don't understand! Buzz is out there!  We've gotta help him!!
Toss 'im overboard!
Were you scared?  Tell me honestly.
C'mon, guys!  Every Christmas and birthday we go through this.
Sargent.  Establish a recon post downstairs.  Code red.  You know what to do.
Mission accomplished.  Well done, men.  Pack it up, we're going home.
Finn, there's a splinter in your left foot.  If you don't let me take the splinter out, it will fester.
Would you mind holding me in your arms for a little while?
I finished it off.
He'll be looking for another apprentice.
Somebody couldn't wait until dark.
But then I had a brother and a sister left.
'Have ploughed the stormy seas - '
I... I don't really know.
I understand.  You're upset.  You want to know what's going on.  That's good.
What about legitimate businesses? We own a construction concern, real estate --
Laundromats for the washing of money. Unfortunately, Carl had only one successful business.
That was a stupid thing you did. Incredibly stupid.
Helena --
That's frustrating.
Oh, it is?
Where are you going?
Did you meet the President?
Czar for life, just like a real czar.
What's up?
What's that mean?
I'm telling you, she doesn't know shit.
He won.  He was a winner.  That bothers you.
Depends who it's from.
I'll put this in the back.
Not Tiger Woods.
You were followed by the police, but they won't hear us over the children. I want to use a bomb.
I don't know.  Eduardo Ruiz is the only real witness against Carl.  The security is very tight.  There may not be a way.
So, it's worth the wait, right? What can I do?  Rent a Huey?  Have an airlift?  It's not like you can put it in a condom up some mule's asshole, right?  How many peasants would that take?  A line stretching from here to Mexico City --
You planning on going somewhere, Eduardo?  You don't like it here? This is the best situation you're going to have for a long, long time.
I don't know, sir.
Relax.  If they were going to kill us they would have done it in the desert.
Madrigal's alive.
I'm trying to bust the Tijuana Cartel.
What is it you want me to do?
You watch and learn.  I earn his trust.  Then more pain.  Then I appear with kindness.  Within a week he will follow me around like a dog.
The busiest land border crossing in the world.  Over forty-one thousand vehicles per day, twenty-two thousand pedestrians on foot.  I think we do a pretty good job but we know a lot of drugs are still getting through.
I've read official estimates but I wouldn't bet my house on them.  I've heard the entire cocaine supply for the United States can fit into four tractor-trailers.  At least a half-dozen of those cars right out there are carrying a load of dope, with drivers employed by people who don't give a damn if they're caught or not.
I want your money, I'll take your money.
She snuck away.  And we haven't seen her.  She hasn't come home.
Oh, man --
I recruited the best men in Mexico for my task force and put them through a rigorous screening process.  Not only physical, but also psychological.
Like you protected Landry?
He died in a liposuction surgery, right?
Mapping the fucking pig genome. We'll call your dad, he's a neurosurgeon --
Did you tell him?
Shut you mouth or you'll be next.
You've stabbed me, man.
Sorry, mate, I'll get you another.
Excuse me, I don't mean to harass you, but I was very impressed by the capable and stylish manner in which you dealt with that situation. I thought to myself: she's special.
What?
Holding hands?
Easy for you to say.
It's Iggy Pop.
So long as everyone keeps their mouths shut, we'll not be getting caught.
I read it in Cosmopolitan.
Oh, really?
Of course, the motto, the motto --
Only to get my foot in the door. Showing initiative, right?
It's no problem.
No.
Right.
No, it's not bad, but it's not great either, is it? And in your heart you kind of know that although it sounds all right, it's actually just shite.
Did he -- you know?
Oh no, don't even mention it.
And I got a stitch stuck between my teeth, jerked my head back and the whole fucking stump fell off.
You're all hear.
Well, this guy I've met runs a hotel. Brother. Loads of contacts. Does a nice little sideline in punting British passports to foreigners. Get you a good price.
Why would I want to sell my passport?
How much?
What was your price?
I'm going to get it right this time. Going to get it set up and get off it for good.
It's fresh air.
Well, what are you waiting for?
Plotting our new course.
What do you know of my pain?
Perhaps I have a way to bring one here.
I think you gave me too much time, Captain.
Captain, we can't trust anyone now.
Captain, Starfleet transmission on line.
Paradise City, can you boost your power? We're barely receiving transmission.
Bird of Prey bearing one zero five mark two.
Jim.
Yes, Spock?
Spock, what is it? Do you know this Vulcan?
I cannot be certain.
You stay out of this!  Why, Spock? Why? I.. All you had to do was pull the trigger.
You ordered me to kill my brother.
Why didn't you tell me this before?
But the center of the galaxy can't be reached. No ship has ever gone into the Great Barrier. No probe has ever returned.
New word. "b".. "a"... um...
...mark two.
Maybe he's not out there, Bones. Maybe he's right here... in the human heart  Spock?
No! No reply. Remain on course.
What you fear is the unknown. The people of your planet once believed their world was flat. Columbus proved it was round. They said the sound barrier could never be broken. It was broken. They said warp speed could not be achieved. The Great Barrier is the ultimate expression of this universal fear. It's an extension of personal fear.  Captain Kirk, I so much want your understanding. I want your respect. Are you afraid to hear me out?
No... I didn't.
But if we do, will that convince you that my vision was true?


I know you'll whip her into shape, Scotty. You always do.
I don't get it.
Want one?
They'll start to soon enough.
You said it.
Yes!
I'm afraid so. I spotted him this time and kicked him out, but he's getting trickier all the time.
There's a 68.71 percent chance you're right.
I'm sorry -
I've gotten 2,415 times smarter since then.
What do you want with the Pentagon?
Flynn!!
You're alive!
Wrote the...?
Well -- that's how it is for programs, yes, but --
Flynn... you can't... I
Well...my home "sector" was called Paramus ...
PARAMUS... wonder what those initials stand for ...  ...probably Program Assist Routine -- well, it sounds like a lovely place.
We have to talk.
Yes, MCP.
That's all going to change, Yori...
No you're not.  You're going to stay here until your father gets home and have cake!
Dana, are you listening to me?
You're going to stay in school. Do you understand?
Honey that song came out in 1968, when I was exactly your age.
Uh huh.  Right here in river city.
Immediate roll.  Acquire subject at K Street and Key Bridge.					* Vehicle is red-and-white						* convertible.  You have six minutes.
They call him "The Sand Spider".				*
See, kids now are ten years ahead				* of where we were at the same age. You probably think she's still a virgin--
Station wagon?
Abu Kaleem Malik.
He-- Helen.  Helen-- it's Helen. It's Helen, Gib.
Yeah, and we do it twenty times a day.  Don't give me that crap. Just put on the taps.  Now.
Whatya talking?  I'm clean as a preacher's sheets, babe.  Clean as a --
There is only one solution to your problem, Mrs. Tasker.  You must work for us.
And you still reach for your piece every time.
Yes what?
Hello, Harry.
This is Samir.  See if you can guess his specialty.
Oral hygiene?
Come on to bed, you don't have to brush your teeth.
They said you had to run out.
What did happen?
Yes.
Do you still love your husband?
I think so.
Natasha?
Now slide the nylons off one by one.
He's got nothing to do with this. It's me you want, right?
My God.  Have you had to...  have sex with other women in the line of duty?
Okay, just ask yourself.  What do women really want?  You take these bored housewives, married to the same guy for years.  Stuck in a rut.  They need some release.  The promise of adventure.  A hint of danger.  I create that for them.
You son of a bitch.  Did you really think you could elude us forever, Carlos?
I said SIT DOWN.  Who do you work for?
Kettleman, Barnes and McGrath. I'm a legal secretary.
Get going! 
Look, Harry's not part of this. He's just a sales rep.
Something you obviously have a hard time doing!
Like one?
Yes.  I suppose so.  Where?
Yes.
That was you?!
You can trust me completely.
What is it you want me to do?
You'll call me then?
To our assignment.
I don't know.  I have to think...
You can call me Simon.  You're very brave to do this...  You opened it.
Gotten your mail yet?
Thank God. I could eat a horse if you slap enough catsup on it.
I thought Sonny was the good guy.
Well, enough about the King. How about you?
I don't remember. But off the top of my head, I'd say black.
Almost four years.
I didn't even know they had stores that just sold comic books.
What would make you think that?
You didn't do nothing.
I'm a call girl. There's a difference, ya know.  I don't know. Maybe there's not. That place you took me to last night, that comic book place.
It's over on the TV. All it says is: "Dear Clarence." I couldn't write anymore. I didn't not want to ever see you again. In fact, it's stupid not to ever see you again. Las night... I don't know... I felt... I hadn't had that much fun since Girl Scouts. So I just said, "Alabama, come clean, Let him know what's what, and if he tells you to go fuck yourself then go back to Drexl and fuck yourself."
Uh-huh.
Is he nice?
Well, I wouldn't go so far as to call him nice, but he's treated me pretty decent. But I've only been there about four days. He got a little rough with Arlene the other day.
You better not be fucking teasing me.
Did ya ever see "The Chinese Professionals"?
I do.
Where you goin', honey?
So I can go over there and pick up your things.
I think what you did was...
Hold on a second, Big D. You sayin' you eat pussy?
What?
Yeah.
Look, Elvis, he is hauntin' me. He doesn't deserve to live. And I do want to kill him. But I don't wanna go to jail for the rest of my life.
Where the fuck is that bitch?
Who the fuck are you?
It's great to hear from you.
I'm a married man.
Well, she's a pretty amazing girl. What are women like out here?
Well, for the past couple of years I've been goin' out with girls from my acting class.
The zoo.  What are you waiting for?
Yeah, well if we got lost, it's your ass.  Come on, Clarence, lets go. Elliot's going to meet us in the lobby.
Do you really mean it?
Now's a helluva time to play "what if".
Really?
What do you think, eightball?
Duh. What else would I be talking about? Now stop askin' stupid doorknob questions. Well, a year and a half ago, this friend of mine got access to the evidence room for an hour. He snagged this coke. But, he's a good cop with a wife and a kid, so he sat on it for a year and a half until he found a guy he could trust.
No. No, you don't.
No. No you're not.
I don't know, Clarence, "Doctor Zhivago" is a pretty big movie.
Well, I have to admit, walkin' through the door and seein' these "Soldier of Fortune" poster boys made me a bit nervous. But, Lee, I'm fairly confident that you came here to do business, not to be a wise-guy. So, if you want, I'll put the gun on the table.
Where'd you go?
A Norms in Van Nuys.
I think there's a Seven-Up in there.
Go to the liquor store -  Where is there a liquor store around here?
Isn't she the sweetest goddamned girl you ever saw in your whole life? Is she a four alarm fire, or what?
Do tell. Why drug related?
I'm the Anti-Christ. You get me in a vendetta kind of mood, you will tell the angels in heaven that you had never seen pure evil so singularly personified as you did in the face of the man who killed you. My name is Vincenzo Coccotti. I work as a counsel for Mr. Blue Lou Boyle, the man your son stole from. I hear you were once a cop so I assume you've heard od us before. Am I correct?
I've seen him.
I'm talkin' about a massacre. They snatched my narcotics and hightailed it outta there. Wouldda gotten away with it, but your son, fuckhead that he is, left his driver's license in a dead guy's hand. A whore hiding in the commode filled in all the blanks.
Are you still working security for Foster & Langley?
I don't see why not. When you gonna come round and see my new place?
Well, the part you're reading for is one of the bad guys. There's Brian and Marty. Peter Breck's already been cast as Brian. And you're reading for the part of Marty. Now in this scene you're both in a car and Bill Shatner's hanging on the hood.  And what you're trying to do is get him off.  Whenever you're ready.
Could we try it now?
Where'd he come from?
But there is a bright side though. If you ever have to play a part of a guy who gets fucked in the ass on a daily basis by throat-slitting niggers, you'll have so much experience to draw on -
Suspect's words -
Like gang-busters. Now, remember, if you don't want to go to jail, we gotta put your boss in jail.
You do more than try.
How's he supposed to see the wire?
He's bluffin ya, Elliot. Can't you see that? You're an actor, remember, the show must go on.
You're the one who wanted to drive fast.
Naw, they ain't stayin' here. But, I know who you're talkin' about. They're stayin' at the Hollywood Holiday Inn.
He's at the Beverly Wilshire.
I didn't mean -
It's important to observe everything.
Forced you!  Why would someone force you to take drugs?
Meaning...???
No.
I have to go.
What year is it?
Oh, Jesus, James!  You killed him!
I got shot.  Look -- there's a gas station up ahead.
It would be great if I'm crazy.  If I'm wrong about everything...the world will be okay.  I'll never have to live underground.
We're avoiding the police until I can....talk to you.
Just like that?  You were in prison?
...I had a dream about...something like that.
You had a bullet from World War One in your leg, James!  How did it get there?
I want to be here.  In this time.  With you.  I want to become...become a whole person.  I want this to be the present. I want the future to be unknown.
It's a Carpet Cleaning Company...
Shh -- don't talk.  Hold still.
I know this place! ... This is my dream.
Scientists.  I'm supposed to report in to them.  They'll want to know they sent me to the wrong time.
If you know how to escape, why don't you...?
What's that mean?
Look at those assholes, they're asking for it!  Maybe people deserved to be wiped out!
That would be totally out of character. Helping people is against my principles.  See, he definitely doesn't know me.  Now, I'm going to go back and listen to my father's very eloquent discourse on the perils of science WHILE YOU TORTURE THIS INTRUDER TO DEATH.
Me?  Are you kiddin?  You're the one! You were a hero, man.  They gave you a pardon!  And whadda you do?  You come back and fuck with your teeth!  Wow!
They gave you a pardon, man.  Whatdaya want?
I asked you, why did you volunteer?
Don't be defensive, Kathryn, this isn't an inquisition.
Kathryn, you know he can't possibly know that.  You're a rational person. You're a trained psychiatrist.  You know the difference between what's real and what's not.
What...virus?
Might be tight.
What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself?
I ain't got no eyes.  You want to see?
Yeah, sure.  You got change?
I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?
I'm a little short. I'll catch you next time.
You afraid of the dark?
No and I don't plan on sticking around either.  I don't guess I'll be seeing you again.  Take it easy.
I need a ticket.
Then why do you call it Harlin's?
'Cause Harlin used to own it.
If I could do you think I'd be standing here wasting my time.  Can you fix it, or do I have to go somewhere else?
Twenty-after-ten.
Hey, your . . . what the hell happened to you.
Then you ain't gonna have the car.
Yeah, well, I've been around the bend a bit.
You think bad, and bad is what you get.
That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.
You said this morning the hose was going to run me one-fifty.
Take it.  As soon as I get my money. Fifty dollars for an almost new gasket.  You don't know what kind of a deal you're getting.
I'm taking my car, and I'm taking it now!
What you want?
We ain't got no Beck's.
What do you want?
Jake.  I thought you would be at work, dear.
Can I give you a hand, beautiful?
It's Grace.
Accident.
Oh, this isn't my car.  It's down a ways.  I should have parked closer. I just didn't think it would be so heavy.  I could drive up.
Thank you, John.
You just travel around, no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.
I pack up and go somewhere else.
I guess.  I've got an ego same as any man.
You can let go of me now.  I'm safe.  How do they look.
Beautiful?
Did you ever?
And I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.
Beautiful.  Beautiful beaches.  Blue water and clear skies as far as you can see.
One-hundred-thousand!?  That son-of- a-bitch lied to me.
John?  John where are you going?
I don't know what I was thinking, but I can't do it.
Kill someone.  I can't do it.
I came back for you; this morning I came back.  Before I even knew about the money. You're what I want.
You don't know?  Jesus Christ! Don't you think you should have found out before we killed him?
There has to be!
It's got to be here.  I heard him talk about it.  He bragged about it. Six steps out, three left.
John . . .?
Well, nothing.
Why?  So when the cops catch up with us you can try and sell me out again?  You take your hald of the money and run.  You might want to try Mexico.  With all that dough you'll live like a queen.
Are you all right?
John, throw me the keys.
Where you headed?
I've got to make a stop in Vegas, then I'm heading to Santa Barbara.
You a sailor man?  That'd be the life.  Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away. A man could pretty well disappear like that.  Just sail away until all he was was a memory.  I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.
I hope so.  Listen, Mr. McKenna, about your wife:  If I had known she was married--
Now what can I do for you?
I was hoping we could talk.
You said you had an insurance policy out on your wife.  Fifty-thousand dollars.
Let's say I do want her dead.  What is it you want?  This morning you weren't a killer.
I guess I have what you'd call a love-hate relationship with Grace.
Trouble with the car again?
It's not like that.
That's not the reason I'm here.  I swear it.
Liar.
That's a lot of talk.  A whole lot of talk.
Wh . . . what are you talking about?
This morning when I came in on you and Grace, you swore you hadn't so much as been near the bedroom.  Now you make straight for it.
Then maybe this afternoon.  When I sent you to kill my wife you ended up sexing her instead.
What are you . . . you can't . . . you can't kill me.
I don't blame you.  What man would? I admit it, okay?  I came back here and I made it with Grace.  But if you kill me you're making a big mistake.
What are you babbling about?
That country shit all sounds the same to me.
You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that one movie.
Get it through your head, little girl; I'm not going for you.  If this Toby likes you, then if I were you I'd marry him.  You're not going to get much better in this town.
That's what I thought until you came riding in.  I saw your car over at the gas station.  It's cool.  Want to take me for a ride?  Desert's kind of lonely this time of day.
What the hell are you talking about?
Mister, I'm calling you out.
John, what a surprise.  I expected to be seeing you, not talking to you over the phone.
Stay as long as you like, son.  No rush.
Nice night for a drive.  Morning really.  I guess that's about the only way to keep cool; riding around with the top down on a fancy convertible in the first hours of the day.
Not taking a drive, Sheriff. Heading out of town.
I don't understand what the--
There's nothing in the trunk, Sheriff.
Yeah I want something.  I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.
You can't do that yourself?
I ain't got no eyes.  You want to see?
Not this twig, friend.  I got plans.
I don't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone.
I'm leaving.  You never have to see me again.  Just please, give me the ticket!
A lot that means.
An overheated car.
Got work.  I know a man who's got a boat. Wants me to sail it for him.
You love her, but you hate her?
...I don't know.  Tell her you had to see her.  Tell her you don't care if she's married or not, you had to be with her. Sweet talk the woman.  A young buck like you must be good at that.  Then ... maybe shift the conversation.  Get her thinking about that jeep of hers.  She loves that thing.  Maybe the only thing she does love. She'll want to take you for a ride.
I guess this is what they call "ironee"? Hunh?
You'd tell me anything to save your pathetic life.
What the hell are you talking about?
Don't be afraid of him none.  I don't care what he does to you, we can still be together.
Yeah, I can fix it.
Gotta run over to the yard and see if I can find a hose like this one, or close enough. Gonna take time.
Twenty-after-ten.
Just banged my head.  It was an accident.
Actually, it's been about three hours. You're the one thinks that car's so damn fancy.  What you expect but fancy damn prices?
"That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang."
You ain't got no credit card but you got a lawyer. Sweet talk me all you want.  Didn't you read the sign? It says...
Yeah, well, I've been around the bend a bit.
You said this morning the hose was going to run me one-fifty.
I don't give a fuck! I didn't tell you to do it!  You can't just do unauthorized work.
I want my car.
I don't know your real name.
What happened to your hand?
Wasn't nothing.
Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take.
Where you headed?
Did you like it; me watching you?
Must get kind of lonely for a woman living by herself in a big house.
I think I can find my own way back to into town.
What's the matter?...Grace?
You'd never understand.
Jake hides it. In a safe. In the floor. In the bedroom. He counts it. He loves to sit there and count it.
I can't kill, Grace. I can't kill anybody.
I mean it, Grace.  I'm getting out of here, and I want to take you with me.
I thought you couldn't get your car.
I came back for you; this morning I came back.  Before I even knew about the money. You're what I want.  The only reason I stormed off is because you spooked me talking about Jake.  But I've had nothing but time to think about it.  It keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here.  But we've got to get the money, baby.  We get the money, I get the car, then we get the hell out.
I want a place where only the vultures will find him... It'll be over soon, Grace.
Then will you take me on your friends' boat with you?
Get real Bobby. He was gonna kill you <u>and</u> me.
I was just baiting him! Bobby, I had to tell him that to get his guard down. Just like you told Jake you was going to kill me!
Where ya goin'?
Harlin's.
One way, or round trip?
Heineken?
Shasta!  Now why'd you go and scare the nice man like that?  Sorry about that, mister.  Let's see, you want $3.25.  You try to have a nice day now, would you?
I know.  I was here when your apprentice was helping you.  Remember?
You never said anything.  About the drapes.
Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing.  We was just talking.
Whoa, what kind of accent you got there? You one of them Russians?
What's that?  ..."concealed" is a definite no no in this town, Ivan. You know anything about Jamilla's grocery store?
Yes?
Wrap it up.
Okay.
...I can't remember.
Soft and Wet, by the Artist Formerly Known as Prince.
Just one--
I'll help you.
No.
You're lying.
Don't be scared.
Was your family traveling with you?
I'm not going out anymore. I'm not getting hurt again. This was the last time. I told you.
We ain't got it. We ain't got no money.
I didn't think they'd really do it.
I wouldn't point no pistol at nobody, sir.
We never seen him up against any... like these ones... killers.
Are you really going to kill them?
She back in Kansas?
Little Bill, I thought you were dead. I see you shaved off your chin whiskers.
Those cowboys messin' him up?
Shit, Skinny, we got railroad barons an' cattle barons, but you' re gonna be the first of the billiard barons.
They really got all that money, them whores?
Ordinance says you got to turn in your firearms to the County office day or night. I guess you didn't read it with the weather an' all.
I... dunno. I mean, I guess not. No, they ain't carryin' no guns.
You're spillin' your whiskey, mister.
I guess you are Three-Fingered Jack out of Missouri, killer of women and children.
Well, Mister Beauchamp... from what I read of this here book, I'd have to say the writin' ain't a whole lot different from the pitcher.
I believe that to be an accurate description of the events, sir... albeit there is a certain poetry to the language which...
Did you... kill him?
They... they killed him. I... thought you know that. I thought you knew because...
Who killed him?
He hanged him?  Shot him down?
Then... what?
She's passed on, Kid.
I don't never see nobody anyhow.
Well, we was. Like you said, I changed my mind an'...
No.
If he gets behind them rocks we ain't gonna get him... not without we go down there.
Better re-load it.
It's a hell of a thing, ain't it, killin' a man. You take everythin' he's got... an' everythin' he's ever gonna have...
You're gonna kill him, ain't you?
Eleven.
Yup. You still got the Spencer rifle?
Well, it ain't just the bed I'm gonna miss. I'm...  Hell, Billy, I'm sorry. I didn't mean...
I ain't the same, Ned. Claudia, she... straightened me up, got me clear of the whiskey an' all. Us goin' to do this killin'... that don't mean I'm back to like I was. I just need the money... for a new start... for them youngsters.  Remember that drover, the one I shot in the mouth so's the teeth come out the back of his head? I dream about him now an' again. I didn't have no reason to shoot him... not one I could remember when I sobered up.
Nor Quincy, I guess.
Naw. Naw, I don't ever go into town for that.  A man like me... A man like me can't get no woman but one he's gonna pay for... an' that ain't right... buyin' flesh.  Claudia, God rest her soul, she wouldn't have wanted me doin' nothin' like that, me bein' a father, an' all. 
Kid? The Kid's shootin at us?
IS THAT YOU, KID?
Me an' the Kid, we'll head over to the ranch an' as soon as we find him, we'll shoot him. Then we'll come back an' the three of us pick up the money an' head South together.
The Kid, yeah...
Tom? Only how... how if you didn't... didn't come back in a week...  how we was to take half the money to Sally an' say you was...
Before I met your maw, God rest her soul, it used to be I was kinda... wicked... drinkin' spirits an' gettin' into scrapes an' all. Only she made me see the error of my ways an'... I ain't like I was no more.
Nothin's bent.
Yeah.
His pistol must of jammed.
We'll bury him.
&lt;&lt;We were there to buy a man and take him back to Hungary.&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;Don't be stupid.&gt;&gt;
They'll never stop.
That's enough, Edie.
I don't know what you came here for, but we won't have any part of it.
Umm ...
This is not right.
Come on. The guy is a pipe dream. This Kobayashi is using him for window dressing .
You're fuckin' A right, no P.C. Well screw P.C. No right. No goddamn right. You do some time, they never let you go. Treat me like a criminal, I'll end up a criminal.
You are a criminal.
I'm sure you can understand my hesitation.
They - They don't know me. You do. They won't take me unless you go. Look at me. I need this.
Maybe more.
I want you to find Edie. Both of you find some place safe. Tell her what happened - Everything. She knows people. She'll know what to do. If we can't get Kobayashi my way, she'll get him her way.
You set up the line-up.
What about Redfoot?
No matter. Kill away, Mr. McManus.
Someplace else, then.
Which is shit.
No matter. He'll have to know how close we came.
You know a religious guy named John Paul?
Right.
And this is why you never told the D.A.
I never heard of him.
He used all of you to get him on that boat. He couldn't get on alone and he had to pull the trigger himself to make sure he got his man. The one man that could identify him.
Accused.  Not indicted.  He resigned the firm.  Divorced nineteen seventy.  Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in 'seventy-eight.  Since then he's been on his own.  Four cases before the Circuit Court.  He lost them all.  He drinks.
The man's an ambulance chaser ...
So what I want to do is stop it here.  I'm going to make him an offer.  I want to do it myself.  I want it to come from me.
Because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount.  Two Hundred Ten Thousand.  That would mean I keep seventy.
... yes.  Get her on the phone ...
Anything special about the case?
Well, many reasons, actually...
And what did your team do...
My God, we tried to save her...You can't know...You can't know...
Objection, we've...
Objection!
How old are you?
Mr. Concannon...?
I wouldn't do it.
I...
I swear to you I wouldn't have turned the offer down unless I thought that I could win the case...
...What difference would...
You sure you don't want me to stay on.
Her doctors killed her.
He's the Assistant Chief of Anesthesiology, Massachusetts Commonwealth.  He says your doctors, Towler and Marx, put my girl in the hospital for life.  And we can prove that.  What we don't know is why.  What went on in there?  In the O.R.  That's what we'd like to know.  Something went wrong.  And you know what it was.  They gave her the wrong anesthetic.  What happened?  The phone rang...someone got distracted...what?
And ask me what?
Who says that I'm protecting anyone?
You should have taken their offer. Especially if you were unprepared.
And don't give me this shit, 'I was a lawyer, too.'  'Cause I know who you were.  You couldn't hack it as a lawyer. You were Bag Man for the Boys and you still are.  I know who you are.
Business hours are over, Sir. This is the switch...
D'you find an apartment?
What Hotel are you staying at?
And what are you?  A cop?
Laura.
Do you want me to go...?
You told me so.  Maybe you'd get some sympathy.  You came to the wrong place.
... hey, I don't need your charity ...
Come on.  Let's get a drink.
Forget it.  You can't prove it. Sister's testimony is no good. Jury knows we win she gets the cash.
Right.
Okay now.  Cases:  Smith versus State of Michigan.
The 'History'...?
The broad has disappeared...
He saw her at the Northern Care...
What does it mean?    I...I mean we, you have other tactics...
I've been meaning to come in a long time.
You're really...  You, are you the one they told me was the nurse?
Well, well, well.  Huh?
...there are notations every thirty seconds...
As I've said we had some more...
What happened in those three minutes...?
We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro...
...and he's making a billion dollars every minute working for Stearns, Harrington, and he bought a dog, and everything is rosy.   Then Mr. Stearns, he tried to fix a case.
The Big Boy did...?
Huh.
Like all this.
Shouldn't you be sitting down?
Well?
We're going to an opening at the opera tonight. We'll dine at Ernie's first.  Which is easier?
Ernie's.
Knows nothing of a grave out at Mission Dolores, or an old house an Eddy Street, or a portrait at the Palace of the Legion of Honor?
Her mother told me most of then before she died. I dug out the rest for myself, here.
Did she hurt herself?
No, please! I Just want to talk to you!
Listen, I'm going to yell in a minute!
I've heard that one before, too. I remind you of someone you used to be madly in love with, but she ditched you for another guy, and you've been carrying the torch ever since, and then you saw me and something clicked.  Huh!
Who you are --
No, a year ago! Where did you live a year ago!!?
Listen, what is this? What do you want?
No, you don't owe me anything.
Tomorrow morning.
Don't go.
Will you, Judy?
I like that one.
They're none of them right.
Judy --
No, I don't want any clothes! I don't want anything! I want to get out of here!
Ernie's?
You've got a thing about Ernie's, haven't you?
No, I don't want to go. I want to stay here.
...We stood there and I kissed her for the last time. And she said, "If lose me, you'll know that I loved you --
And you were such an apt pupil! What fun you two must have had, playing games with me! Why me? Why did he pick on me?!!
What are you going to do?
Why am I here? What happened?
You don't remember.
Why?
John. Old friends. Acquaintances call me Scottie.
What?
I hope we will, too.
Meet again, sometime.
I don't know.
No.
Of course not! I'm a wanderer!  I'd like to go somewhere I've never been!
How old?
What are you thinking?
Where are you now?
Where were you born?
I didn't jump, I fell! You told me I fell!
No.
Yes?! But --
And it's a all real.
Madeleine --
You believe that I love you?
Yes... you run this hotel.
Oh, but she hasn't been here today. Scottie whirls back on her.
No three-way stretch? How very un- chic.
Well, you know those police department doctors: no sense of style.  Ah, tomorrow!
What are you going to do? Now that you've quit the police force?
I had to quit, Midge.
Johnny, the doctors explained --
Yeah, I'm a brute. We were engaged once though, weren't we?
That's Skid Row... isn't it?
Well, I detected an undercurrent.
If you want to. Naturally, we won't talk about anything you don't want to talk about.
Well, it's a living. But I'm excited about this.
We're leaving from my house in three hours. If you want to come, get your numbers in order by then.
The hell you do.
You have acquaintances - business friends and superficial golf buddies. You have always been a fringe player. You have some serious male on male intimacy problems.
More.
Wait!
What?
Bury her out in the desert.
Her blood is all over the bathroom. I'd say that's a bit of a DNA problem.
Someone goes to Walmart, gets some buckets, brushes, mops, Spic and Span, the works.
No we're not. The bodies are all mixed up. We can't do this to them.
She's Asian. They don't have Jews in Asia.
Don't snap at them!
What?
No way.
What are you talking about?
She's in there!
Your investment ideas never work out.
He's right.
It goes; "Today is the first day of the rest of our lives."
What did you ask me?
What?
What you just said. Say it again.
Just do it.
You've got a warped thought process. Your brain doesn't function properly.
I'm talking about some bad, bad, very bad things. Bad things! Those are bad fucking things!
And if you think you can fuck me, don't. Cause I'm fucking insulated Fisher. Protected. Backed up on floppy. Do you get me? I want my fucking money!
Not a prayer.
You hate women.
This is going to stop right now. Right now!
Florist?
I'm not playing around. I forgot.
What?
He is.
It's not that I don't like him. But the wedding has really got me thinking and... I just keep myself opening up. Crowning. And I want you keeping up with me here.
I just don't see him in the big picture.
I've known him since Cub Scouts.
I've seen it on television.
Do you love me?
You go down there.
Go down to the seat place and straighten this out.
We're leaving from Adam's. Come send me off.
I'm working on it, I've made three calls.  I can't stop thinking about how much I love you.
Hello.
We're on our way home. I just...we're running a little late.
No one's discussing it. I'm just gonna run Micheal home. I'll be right back.
What kind of stupid question is that?
Micheal, by accident.
I told Boyd two fucking minutes!
Like how?
So what do we do?
If you don't tie up all the loose ends it'll never be over.
What does that mean?
That ought to be about the end of that.
...regression of Modern Man to his most primitive, ape-like state...
Take your time. I wish I had.
Shut up Micheal.
Two.
No, miss. Smoking makes him spit and feel ill.
To tell you the truth, not very much. I cannot lie. I respect you and I am grateful to you because I owe you everything materially, but otherwise ...
How like your aunt you are, even in your walk.
Yes, I don't want you ever to leave this house.
Yes.
How much is that?
Hold on, Ramon! Is there time to make another trip?
It's very good.
He was asking for it.
You see how much you like her?
Where's the dough?
Is that all you're going to devote your life to?
And ...your friend?
Then let him go and he'll follow you.
Don't say that.
Don't invent stories; go to bed.
Yes -- very, very big!
He came in through the cupboard.
I'll box your ears if you don't show some respect for the dead! You mustn't play under this tree.
Have you repaired the windows of the dormitories?
Mother?
Welcome, miss. I'm Ramona, Don Jaime's servant.
Hello.
Today, a good girl.
In English, please.
You mean a nano—tech synthetic organism.
Barnes wouldn't kill two innocent guards.
He was a computer program for crissake.
None. He could be hiding, he could be helping Sid, or could be in little pieces on Santa Monica beach.  Any idea what Sid's going to do next?
Trying to find out where the bomb is. Where the hell have you been?
Enough to level an entire city block.
Of the six prison inmates you've tested —— all of whom have had at least some military or survival training -— only Mr. Barnes is still breathing.
It feels so.. .real.
This is supposed to be years away.
It was you, wasn't it?
I couldn't just let them make you bring down my degree of difficulty. I'm a triple-twisting, double back flip off the high platform, not a swan dive.
What do you expect me to do, put your character module in my pocket and just walk you out of here?
No, I just like the effect a tape recorder has on you.  How you feeling today?
In other words, par for the course.  How do you feel about the simulation you participated in yesterday?
Remember a few years ago when music schools were using a computerized teaching tool that accidently started frying kids' brains?
I've been in prison, remember?
What we need to do is stop playing with computers and go catch the son—of-a-bitch before he kills anybody else.
Told you I wasn't going to go anywhere.
Now that he's in the real world, there are no longer limitations on his behavior like there were in virtual reality. Sid is going to evolve.
Don't worry about it, all right?
Enjoying yourself?
We know you didn't kill those guards.
Sid?
You and me have nothing in common.
Now, is that any way to talk to an old buddy? I mean, just because I'm carrying around the joy of killing your family inside me doesn't mean we can't be friends.
You can't die until you tell me where the C-4 is. Where is it?!
As long as you keep overpaying me, I'll be the first to go into production on three, and four, as well.
Well, darlin' <u>I</u> ain't your confessor.  Tell him you've got some info on the President's sex scandal, it's on your conscience, believe me, he'll drop what he's doing.

ON THE MEN, IN THE ROOM, ARGUING ABOUT THE ILLEGAL ALIEN, SCHUMANN IN THE B.G.
Well, let's not be too sure, why is that?
Hello...?
Well, I'm sure that speaks very well of you and for your parents.  But if forced to choose between the security of the country and the security of your Job, which would you pick.  And, while you hesitate, permit me to suggest that they are one and the same.  Your country and your job.
This ain't the illegal immigrant Nanny.
...why?
...you the Press Office?
Where'd you go to school, Kid.  Wellesly?
Do I know you?
And you're here <u>why</u>...?
If we can hold the break-in-the-dam for ten days, til the election, we...
Uh, it's a slogan.  From, uh...
The... 
It's not "war."  It is a <u>Pageant</u>.  It's a <u>Pageant</u>... Like the Oscars... why we came to <u>you</u>...
...Yoha, Yoha... Yoha.  <i>Why</i> Albania?
...there gonna be any money in this thing?
King, King, I got a thing here, a product placement, gonna have a bigger back-end than Hattie McDaniel. Now:
...we put your Guy in a <u>sweater</u>...
In the Folk Music Section.
Oh, he's gonna be Aces.
What's the thing with Morse Code...
Big mistake.
We pick up Schumann.  Sneak him back inside the Beltway. And we plan his homecoming.  Zt's gone be Neil Armstrong, Dr. Livingston, and <u>Lindy</u>...They're gonna forget, they're gonna forget, they're gonna forget that there <u>is</u> an election...The Pres's gonna have to say, one of his speeches, "Don't forget to Vote..."
I got it in the inaugural.  "Thank you for voting for me, but, <u>as</u> importantly:  Thank you for <u>voting</u>... 
The Albanian Campaign.
Just....do what I ...look:  get me a ...hello...? Hel...?  I'm going to need an <u>ambulance</u>, we take him, the last moment, right from the Pl...no, <u>we</u> land, we puttem <u>in</u> the ambulance.  Air force jet lands, we take somebody <u>else</u> off <u>that</u> jet...what the fuck do <u>I</u> care? Somebody in a Hospital gown.  And we need a ......hello?  Hello...?
"...unsure whether or not Enemy Action..."
Deal's changed.
It's got to sound like an <u>acetate</u> recording, 1930.
Going to make a little stop back home, pick up my shirts, show him a little treat.
Black...
British Regiments drape their drums in Leopard Skins.
Can we give'er a <u>kitten</u>?
I believe in you....
The hats.
I need a ruling on the Hats.  I say a Leopard-skin, and...
Of course, we're gonna need some <u>water</u>, uh...
...takes years of genetics, pal, and a Yale education... and the right tailor.
Buddy, buddy, buddy; little trouble, huh, today.
Buddy, buddy, when ya gonna realize it's big game hunters that bag the elephants, not retail brokers. I heard this story about Gekko... he was on the phone 30 seconds after the Challenger blew up selling NASA stocks short.
Nice guy but a loser. Lost all his equity when his firm went belly up in the recession of 71. you wanna be coming in here in your late sixties still pitching? ... Whatever happened to that cute analyst at Thudder, Wicks? ... Cindy? Susan?
Then get out and close it behind you.
The stock's going to Pluto!
So come home and live rent free, 'stead of that cockroach palace you live in. $50,000 Jesus Christ, the world is off its rocker. I made $37,000 last year and you...
...Got a 100 on me, you...
Client. Got a private jet over at Butler Aviation... Dad, you always gotta light up when you see me, it's the...
... Dad, you should've been a CEO. How about dinner?
No, thanks, I'm nervous enough.
Like? Uh...hmmm. Well...
I got this guy who should know tells me buy Hewlitt Packard but I been burned on tips. What do you think Bud?
Well we're thinking of putting up a statue of you in the subway. I hear you're moving up in the world. An associate already. Not bad. How's Margie?
What about you, I hear you guys are handling the Fairchild Foods merger and it may not be going through. Any surprises I haven't read about in the Wall Street Journal?
More money than you ever dreamed, Roger. And the thing is no one gets hurt...how bout a beer?
...and you don't have to put up a dime, Roger.
...got a strange call from the SEC. They asked to see my records... Bud, this is a heavy...
....Relax Roget  You're 82M in the account numbers and I'm the Invisible Man... they're always looking for red flags, Gekko's always getting checked by them, they never come up with anything... we're invulnerable on this...
He never told me...
How do you do Mr. Gekko. I'm Bud Fox.
Can't tell you that, Mr. Gekko.
Teldar's shooting up. Buy any for yourself? Bet you were on the phone two minutes after you got out of my office.
Revenge is a dish best served cold... well, it's payback time, sport.  ... see that building? I bought into it ten years ago. It was my first real estate deal. I sold it a couple of years later and made an $800,000 dollar profit. It was better than sex. At that time I thought that was all tne money in the world...  Now, it's a day's pay ... I had a mole in Wildman's employ. Gave me half the picture, then he got fired...
Sorry, Mr. Gekko.
Oh yes, I remember you.
I'd give anything to have this in my house, even for a week.
Oh really?  Well, I guess you can kiss that career as an art appraiser goodbye, because we paid over four hundred thousand for it at the contemporary picture sale last June.
Not really. I'd say that Gordon is one of the most astute collectors around. He has a great eye and he only buys the best. Like this rug for instance, a silk Tabriz, the finest of its kind. The day after he bought it in London, a dealer representing the Saudi Royal Family offered him twice what he paid. It absolutely makes the room. See how this little bit of celadon in the border is picked up in the cushions oh the sofa... although...  I don't know if I would have used that tea dipped linen for the upholstery - too dingy. And it's a sacrilege having that Pre-Columbian pot in the center of the coffee table. Some dope might use it as an ashtray.
He's not a racehorse, Bud, he's a jumper.
If I could have anything... this would almost do.
I'll bet he's got an opinion on the stock market too. This apartment is already ahead of its time. I call it the "demolished" look. They've already heard about it at House and Garden and they're coming next week to photograph it before it gets... lived in. Is that alright? I'd love to have it in my portfolio.
...are you going to trade all night again? You got to go to work in a couple of hours.
So did I, till I hit 19 and found I had all the royal habits and no throne. Mom got by but I had to go to work just like you. Only the skills I had were shopping and making friends. So...that's why I do what I do, what makes you tick, Buddy?
Don't cross Gordon. He'll crush you. You've worked hard to get where you are. If Gordon doesn't buy Bluestar someone else will; and who's to say they won't do the same thing.
What do you say we go get a suite at the Carlyle? Caviar? Champagne? Celebrate, just like the old times Sunshine.
Maybe it does. Don't patronize me Gordon.
You and I are the same, Darien. We're smart enough not to buy into the oldest myth running: love... A fiction created by people who got nothing to keep them from jumping out of windows.
He respond to the offer? What? What the hell's Cromwell doing giving lecture tours when his company's losing 60 million a quarter? I guess he's giving lectures on how to lose money...if this guy opened a funeral parlor, no one would die, this turkey's totally brain dead...Well Christmas is over and business is business.  Keep buying. Dilute the sonofabitch. Ollie I want every orifice in his body flowing red.
Are you prepared to put that in writing?
Cards are on the table. What do you think?
He still likes you
We need to talk. CHINA Yeah about what?
Oh Mark.  It's ok.  It's ok.
Yes, it's always been one of my favorites too.
They seemed, closing by much 
Then why do you still like her?
Well, it all started when a friend and I
Guys, if I'm going to play the hero at least give me a little room.
Sir Wilfred, this is Sarah Brighton.  This is Sir Wilfred.
So Mark, what's so urgent?
Mom, I'm sorry.  I wanted to tell you. But it never felt right.
I think playing in a band called "Bitch" might put a dent in the whole "perfect family" thing.
It got so bad your father almost had to put me away.
She finished my solitaire game and turned on the radio...she likes rock and roll. Angry rock and roll.
There was just...some tension.  You were upset.  I remember being concerned.
Who?
Give me that shit.  Your wife.
Who are you?
How?  How can you help me?  With your flowers and your perfect life...
You do?
Your house is so beautiful.
Have you ever felt so completely consumed by a feeling for someone that you couldn't breathe?  That the time together is so passionate and consuming that you felt physical pain when they would leave?
I don't know.
I didn't sleep with him.
Stop.
She got it.  Turned it down.
Good.  I'm good.
Oh my god.  You bought it.
We wish to commune with the spirit of Mrs. Feur.  What's her first name?
I'm sorry for leaving, but I mean, Jesus, Claire...
And he's the real thing.  Specializes in cases like this, like yours.
Okay.  Okay.
Adamant?
We need help.  Please let me call the medium.
Alight, alright.  Stay calm.  You opened this door.  There's got to be a way that you can close it.
But he acted like he'd never heard of it.
You did a great job.  She's a good kid.
But what if something happens?
Nothing.  There was...I thought I saw something.
That's just mean.  Oh.  Jody wanted to know if I could get her some.
You didn't?
Oh, right.  Yes.  Harvey says the guy's a sweetheart.  Wouldn't hurt a fly.
He did.  She's in the picture.  I went over to look and she's gone.  The table was set for one.
I didn't do that.
...since Caitlin.  You don't remember this?
I know I'm not at the center of the bridge.
We had a seance.
Who did?
Jody and I.  And she was there, Norman, she was.  It scared Jody so bad she had to leave.
You know I am.
I...
In the living room...
I may have seen her on campus.
The...
It's too rough.
Claire, please don't...
I don't know, but I am.  She was there and then she was gone.  I felt it.
Adamant.
I'm cooking you dinner.
What?
No scaredy-cats in the Talamasca, huh...?
What have the witches always asked of you...?
on't know what else to do.  Maybe I just don't belong in her life.  well - I'm already out of her life.
What are you talk---
Then you wear it.
I'm sure he's alright, Bea. They'll find him somewhere.
You babbling that nonsense - now...? This is a wedding.
Rowan Mayfair.  Who's calling...?
-Ellie said she died when I was BORN!  She's been alive...? ALL THIS TIME...? Why have I been lied to when -
She was alive all these years... You NEVER let me know her. Who gave you that right...?!
I might as well be Rowan Smith - or Jones!   you cut me off from every -
It wes a dream...!
Massive subdural hamatoma.  We have to evacuat it - right now.
It is from love.
you crave what I might show you.  What you can learn.  What I can give you.  So much more than Michael can.
--- and I have heard you from the beginning... from it's very first beat.
Focus all your powers on me, Rowan until it is done. Only me...
What is wrong...?
Aaron was in the dream.  A dream tilled with spirits.   you killed him, didn't you...?
Harder...
They like you ------- kids.
What do you see...?
Why don't you let at do that...?
Stop it.
Everyone - this is Michael curry.
Hello..
You're a ve-ry bad witch, you know that...?
Their what...?
Hey - you're bleeding.
You look a little green.
No.    This is unreal...
It's not some fairytale in an old book.    Michael - look at me.  I didn't choose this, Michael.  This is who I am.  I love you.
ROWAN we're below sea level. I've spent time there myself.
You could kill me - right now, couldn't you...?  couldn't you...?!  Tell me the truth --- is it Lasher...?  Answer me!!
Its cramped in here isn't it BRIAN
And it can't be forged?
You don't know?
Where do you kill them...
Because a dog will attack with a ferocity and force that we poses, but centuries of social contamination has run it out of us - that is what sets us aside from the purity of the beasts...Society is rotting - men who once were strong and kept everything working are getting soft - women are making them soft - by the time a pretty girl has reached twenty - she has had three lifetimes worth of fun and attention- so she doesn't deserve any more -
Why should I?
And how did it feel to be rid of him
What is it?
Yes...
You want me to wear white for you? You must be madder than I thought...
Where are you going?
ELLEN, would you like a cup - there's plenty in the pot
I haven't been using it recently LESLIE
I'm sorry, I couldn't - when is she due?
ANGEL...
That's crazy talk.
Nobody knows you barfed during junior high school graduation.
Don't tell me.  Another vision of incomparable beauty?
Our plane crashed. In the Grand Canyon. A big fiery explosion. We never made it to L.A. They needed dental records to identify us. And this place. This. Actually. Is. Heaven.
Naked girls, wild sex, video games. No wonder it's called "Heaven."
Every one of these women thinks she should be the next Angel of the Month. It's your job, Ted, to decide which of them is right.
You really don't get it, do you? I am genetically programmed to desire a big, buff, manly man who can defend and provide for me and my yet to be conceived offspring! It's, like, a caveman thing!
I mean, what do you think?
I was always too shy to admit how much I liked you.
We have a truckload of strawberries arriving on Tuesday morning.
We wanted you and Jimmy to have it someday. Something real and honest.
We're not ashamed of you, Teddy. We don't approve of the magazine or the models or the so-called "flesh parties" you attend. But we can get past all that.
We think you should give up the magazine. Sell it. Let someone else run it. Whatever it takes.
I guess we could go to Disneyland or something.
Like one of those "National Geographic" specials with the topless chicks?
I know they were simple people, but did this trip help your college fund at all?
Dad, let's just say I can buy anything I want in the whole bookstore. Including the bookstore.
Sorry I--
THAT is your dream, not mine. My dream is so far beyond anything YOU PEOPLE could even imagine.
Oh, sweetheart! We wish we could be right there to hug the living daylights out of you!
Well, Jay. They've been exceptionally supportive.
Better view, more spacious, new carpet. It's a no-brainer.
If you could just sign right there.
I didn't forget.
Go ahead. Ask her to the prom. Get it over with.
In the sense that there is no "hidden agenda" behind a bake sale that raised five hundred dollars for seeing eye dogs.
I'm still better than you. Nothing changed except the decimal point in your savings account.
I don't get the distinction.
I felt limited. I felt confined. I felt like I was suffocating.
Life must be peachy on Planet Ted.
My adoptive grandfather. Who knows what my biological grandfather did.
Considering this is your first time on a private jet, on which you are interviewing the world's most eligible bachelor,  you are extremely cavalier.
You're so twitterpated you don't even see the miner's hat and the pickax.
I can't believe your dad built this for you.
Now it makes sense, the whole neo Bohemian, down with hypocrisy, fight the power crap. You're a poor little rich girl.
But you never do.
There's gotta be something. We have to dig deeper.
Well? Where the hell are you?
Look at us. It's one o'clock in the morning, on a school night. We're in a smoky nightclub, hoping to catch our principal with some big city tart.
My desire betrays me, like goosebumps on my flesh.
I figured you for more of a hairy armpit guy.
Sounds, voices, music, humming. All of it can turn me on, or off, like a switch.
Turned out to be a scoundrel, eh? I saw that one coming.
You've seen one naked breast, you've seem them all.
I'm all right, Mom. I'm not in Siberia, you know.
Only the best for my mother.
You don't have to work another day in your lives.
Yes, sir. I'll brace myself.
Ted, you are the best editor this school paper ever had. You don't need to be pandering flesh. It's nonsense. It's beneath you.
Honestly, Merk. It's like you were never seventeen and the head of a media empire.
Rules are rules.
All those people out there. It's a lot of pressure.
I do?
Whoa. But...that's the thing...  I've never even actually...
You were the new and improved you.
I would have been laughed right out of Xenia.
No one will be laughing at you now, Ted. You can take that to the bank.
It's really going to be strange going home in a couple of days.
Thanks for teaching me an important lesson. What makes a family is love, not blood.
That's great.  I'll just tell my creditors I'm not a rapist.  No problem... Shit.  I can't believe the board's going to act without even hearing my side of it.
I love Antigua.  Maybe I'll come visit you.
You come all the way out here to watch Walter?
That's okay, Kelly.  You're doing fine.  But I have to ask you something here. When you say it hurt.  Was this the first time a man was inside you?
He kept saying, "Let it happen, let it happen."  Then he just stopped.
Not at first.  He was still inside but he wasn't moving or anything...  He said we had this secret.  And that now he'd be able to help me... because we were close... Something like that.  I don't know.  It's hard to remember, exactly.
She didn't cone home last night.  We found her car at the bus terminal, but nothing to suggest she bought a ticket.
Maybe she used another name.
You can go up to one of those trees and peel the bark.  You know what you get? More bark.  And more bark.  There's no core.  Tree's not good tar anything but sucking up water.  And now they can't get rid of them.  They've tried poisons. Nothing works.  They don't die.
That's what they called it when I was in Juvenile.  It's a pretty dismal place.
Why?  You ask me, Lombardo had it pretty good already, nice job in a beautiful setting, popular, an active social life.  He's gonna put this all on the line for some dicey play like what you're describing...
It's starting, Gloria.  This is how it begins...
Yeah, maybe, a little.
You didn't tell me you were gonna put me on the fucking news.
I fucked up.  I lost control of the situation, the one thing they train you for... God, what did I do?
She bit you?
Shit, what difference does it make... Nobody's gonna believe me anyway...
Suzie!  Did this man rape you?
Come on.  Beats study hall, doesn't it?
You and Suzie used to come out here together?
Yeah, but he can't push you around like he can me.  You've got family and they've got clout.  With we it's different... with me...
Is there some reason why you're here?
Excuse me?
You're out of your mind.
Don't bother.  I'm taking a trip.
The only way we're gonna blow this now, is if we do it ourselves...
I don't know.  I want to see you...
I love you.  Now give me the line.
You can tie whoever did it to Sandra Van Ryan...
Come on, let loose!
I was just thinking about where I'm gonna stay.  I lost the house.  It's like waking up from a goddamn nightmare.
You can't...
That's cop bullshit.
Is this supposed to mean something to me?  What triangle?
Yes.
But you do admit to touching her, to putting your arm around her.  Isn't that against the rules?
But then you knew what he was like all along... Maybe his killing Kelly was a thing you had counted on...
I'll bet.  Look, Sam.  Why don't you come by this weekend.  We'll take the boat out...
Your train?  Listen, friend, you're obviously lost.  ... I've got orders here to take possession of this train and to investigate a certain crime.
Sorry.  Didn't mean that.  Just a little device of mine...
Always hoping.  Or this...
Almost?
Never seen a gun fire so fast!
At least the thing's not that fast. We just follow it.  Whenever it stops, we're there, waiting.
Well... that, too.
Strange... you'd think he'd have this place better guarded.
They're so precious when they're asleep.
What's this?
I know!  I know!
We've got to stop him right here, now!  With that armored steam engine of his it'll be a slaughter.
It was in your book.
God in heaven, what is that?!
Pull the balloon right in front of him!  We'll board the damn thing!
The machine was stopped!  It seemed like a perfect time to disable it! Why'd you have to throw it into full throttle?!
He was going to shoot me!  Do you mind?!
Terribly sorry.  I'm always sticking this where it doesn't belong.  Federal agents, ma'am.  We're rescuing a kidnap victim...
You didn't tell us you had this on!
I could get used to this, looking down on people.
My name's Tyler.  Frank Tyler. Pleased to meet you, ma'am.
Oh, don't worry.  I've already overlooked the fact your name's not actually on our guest list.
You tell me.
Forgive me, but you don't strike me as the social secretary type.
My.  It's gotten longer.
You know, I really hate being toyed with before someone shoots me.
Don't try to bamboozle me, Colonel. Has another scientist been kidnapped or not?
Mr. President, good to see you again, sir.  Sorry about all that.
We find ourselves at the dawn of the Golden Age of Science.  And it is the God-given destiny of this glorious nation to carry the torch that lights the way!
I must compliment you on Miss Thompson... an exceptionally charming assistant.
You got that right.  Now get up. We're walking out of here.
Has it penetrated that adrenaline- addled skull that you are surrounded by seventy-eight of my loyal followers?  You are in my domain!
The first.
Because I am holding all the western territories hostage, Mr. West!  A town a day will disappear!  Willard was merely a test run, a stroll in the park.  Next, I level all of Albuquerque!  Yes, that's right.  Only yesterday I learned what you undoubtedly already know: your own President will be there.  What an added bonus! The gods are shining on me!  After tomorrow every American citizen will rise up and demand I be given back my humble little empire!
He... he's planning to kill us, isn't he?
Now it's a bomb.
When are they coming?
We're going into battle, little one.  Find a woman to take care of it.
You left me to die, friend.
You gonna be a hero, Madmartigan? I've lost half my men fighting Kael, and Bavmorda, and the Nock- maar army.  Now you and this Peck, and that magpie up in the rafters, are gonna take 'em on alone?
Out for a little ride in the coun- try, Airk?
You mean, you know who this baby belongs to?
He's no magician.
Thanks for your help, Peck.
And give her a bath everyday, and don't let her get cold.  And keep her diaper changed.
Hey!  Give me that baby!
Now Willow, I know you're gonna blame me for this but it wasn't my fault...!
Madmartigan!  I can't stand being in closed-in places.
Daikinis are giant people who live far far away.
No!
I must concetrate my imagination...to creat a new...reality!
Again:  what is the magician's weapon?
We gotta follow them.
If you rest the baby on your shoulder, she'll stop crying.
I know she's hungry.  I tried to feed her but she wouldn't eat a thing.  I'm not a wet nurse.
She requests the presence of your- self and the young princess.
Its branches are supposed to be made of gold, solid gold.
Didn't you hear me, Book? Pull! You never had your hands on a teat before?
Upstairs, asleep. Where'd you think?
Eli says you're a carpenter, Book.
Everything is all right, John.
I saw him.
He was... like him.
Are they going to kill you?
Don't let them hurt you.
How reliable is this kid?
What have you got?
Zenovitch was about to deliver a list of names tonight – street chemists... the guys processing this P2P into speed.
If I did, I'd have kept my mouth shut...  It fits, Paul... Fifty-five gallons of P2P confiscated four years ago... Guess who was in on the collar? Mac.  He salts it away somewhere... he knows the stuff is potent, but the street chemists haven't figured out how to process it. But they do now.  And now the stuff is worth five-grand a pint and there are a lot of pints in a fifty-five gallon drum.
Listen to me, Johnny. Come in! You're out there all alone... We're getting close... real close... Maybe if you listen to me for a minute we can work something out so you can come in –
It's all over, Paul.
You don't understand, we have nothing to do with your laws!
But why?
Aren't you? After today?
What you do is take vengeance! Which is a sin against heaven!
Yeah... I can put it all together when I get back, 'Til then, you know nothing, understand? Business as usual...
You didn't have to...
You're not carrying a bullwhip... how'd you manage to put my kids to work?
Fred. The way he looked when you screamed at him.
Eli, John is a carpenter.  As well as being a fine policeman.
I have done nothing against the ordnung.
No sin? Maybe. Not yet. But, Rachel, it does not look...  Don't you know there has been talk? Talk about you, not him. Talk about going to the Bishop. About having you... shunned!
John, lost control of himself. He... will be repentant.
I wish dawdie was with us.
Aunt Em!
I saw you tinkering with that contraption, Hickory. Now, you and Hunk get back to that wagon!
If any!
Now look, here's something that really has a heart. This is the best invention I ever invented.
The Wizard of Oz?  Is he good or is he wicked?
How did you guess?
That's all -- the Crystal's gone dark.
But -- what's this?  I thought you were going along with me.
...Oh, did that hurt?
I - I guess they tried to, but they bent their stingers.
Oh, dear. I don't know what I'd do if a whole swarm kept -- Oh! Oh! Oh, there's one on me!
Tomorrow?  Oh, but I want to go home now.
Oh, my!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Well, of course not.  My goodness, what a fuss you're making.  Well, naturally, when you go around picking on things weaker than you are -- Why, you're nothing but a great big coward!
A home --
Yes -- let's run!
How about a hippopotamus?
Why, I'd thrash him from top to bottomamus!
Did they hurtcha?
Ohhhh --
But maybe you'd better not.  I've got a witch mad at me, and you might get into trouble.
Oh -- well -- you're not starting out very well.
What?
The other side....
Looks like we came a long way for nothing.
Oh -- Oh --
...ting the ruby slippers?
I -- Oh --
Come on -- I've got another idea.
Dorothy!
You don't get around us that easy!
Who do you suppose they were? And where did they take her? A fine thing - to go to pieces at a time like this!
Oh, I hate to think of her in there.  We've got to get her out. 
You put up a great fight, Lion.
Shame you had to spot I wasn’t the real thing.
But what if...
Old friend?
Sir Robert tried to deal with the kidnapping with his own...resources, at first. When Elektra’s ear was delivered to him in the post, he came to me.  I advised against paying the ransom. I knew it was Renard. I played it out as long as possible to get a fix on him.
Now Robert is dead. He got his revenge.
Your last chance. Take the money.
Your last chance. Give me the name.
How long has he been with you?
I can’t stay here.
Surely you believe in living dangerously.
What’s wrong with you?  Are you crazy?
Are you saying...Renard is the man who’s trying to kill me?
Know what happens when a man is strangled?
You, of course. I need some information.
So.  My way.  No MI-6, no Interpol.  Just you, me and my people.
Major Adamson, I can't seem to get in the door.
Blake?  Dead?
Would you like me to stay?
Mm hmm.
Collect me?
But you knew that I'd -- die.
Then do me a favor.  If the world's going to end, it shouldn't matter a bit.  I want you to cure me.
What??
You ruthless son of a bitch.  You really believe this mad-scientist bullshit is going to save the world?
Of course, we looked like idiots in those bondage outfits.
Christ yes, I went in for a cancer scan first thing.  Gave me a couple of rough nights, I'll tell you . . .  How about you, Laurie?
Old?
Laurie --
God, you sound like Jon.  -- Turn around.
They're practically on us . . .
That's because --
You're full of yourself.  What are you doing?
What do you mean, frame-up?
Where's Laurie?
What caused it?
Adrian.  What are you doing?  Why wouldn't you let us in?
You're lying, Miss Juspeczyk.
I don't know their real names!
Adrian!  Don't leave so soon.  I --
Stay, Adrian.  I just -- every once in a while, I need to talk to someone human.  He doesn't think like we do.  He doesn't even feel what we feel.  I mean -- he even scares the research teams.
Terrorist.  Radical agitator.  Stool pigeon.
The name's Gibbons. You were saying?
That shows me already that you don't have a clue. What's it to you, anyway?
What do I get out of it?
You did say "Ahab"? You're sure about that?
This is good work, X, damn fine work. You need to press on at all costs, find out what they have planned with this "Ahab".
Kinda funny, though, isn't it? We're not supposed to be making weapons like that anyway. Guess we shoulda played by the rules.
But I hate cops, remember? Except for her.
I'll go in with a team. But first I'm going to need some intel. I'll have to put someone inside, someone new, someone they won't see coming. One of their own.
But programmable. And expendable.
What game is that?
Slick graphics, huh? See these dudes? They're called "Anarchy 99", they're the bad guy bosses.
Yorgi masterminded the take-over of three Red Mafiya clans. Cops called it "blood week". He combined all of their global enterprises into one huge crime syndicate: Anarchy 99.
Oh. I bet by the end he gets something out of it.
It's gonna be like that, huh? You got all bent out of shape as soon as he started dancing with someone else. Why's that?
Mind your business.
Where are you going?
I was invited. What's your story?
Maybe we should start again, yes? I know so little about you, except that you're not what you say you are.
There's something I didn't have time to tell you before.
Of course it matters. Hey, hold on!
Aren't they gonna wonder were you've been?
What was that for?
What's the deal?
What's so damn funny?
Who's writing this dude's dialogue?
Sorry, man, don't know what you're talking about.
It's all this craziness! It's what we've been living since 99, when we left the Army. One of our brothers died in Grozny and we said the hell with this shit. What for? He dies for what? Politics? Who's politics? Not ours.
Sure, if that's what you want. Why not? It's all human nature. So we just have to launch our baby and wait for the decline and fall of civilization as we know it.
Scott.. I -
Hey.  I'm sorry.  About Logan.  I was jealous.
I'll tell you one thing though.
By reading my thoughts?
If necessary.
I was thinking maybe you and me could go into town.
Logan, do you see this ring?
Dr. Grey.
Mr. Guyrich has been dead for some time Senator.
What is it you intend to do to me?
Where am I?
Forty-eight hours, old man.  But if you cross me, I won't feel any guilt about what I do to you.
To find Rogue.
You designed this yourself?
I'll find him.
You definition of definitive was always a bit extreme for me, Max. What is it like these days?
I wouldn't really have let you die, you know.  I just needed...
It does indeed, Max.
And what do you do when you wake up to that?
Yes, my dear, he is.
Give him an extra dollar.
Yes, sir?
What in God's name are you doing?
Baack!
MMmmm.
I promise.
Very....very!
Oh, nice.
Goodbye, darling.
No, of course not.  I just meant...
Poor Delbruck!  There must be some way to reach him -- to control that body.
Good night.
I hope you find this comfortable. This was Baron Victor's room.
How long will this whole thing take?
A week.  Ten days at most.
But wasn't that the whole basis of your grandfathers work, sir...? the re-animation of component parts?
But, sir...
Frederick Frankenstein?
Are you putting me on?
But they told me it was Ee gor.
Did you hear that strange music?
What?
It is!  This was my grandfather's private library.  Look at this!
Could be worse!
He only died two weeks ago -- I'm sure they'll still have him. Hurry now.  I'll prepare the body.
You'd better hurry -- I think it's going to rain.
Cold!  Cold and dead!
Don't fall for that one.
Whew!  I'm glad that's over with.
... I'm glad that's...
Yes, Master!
That sound good, boss.
Diff'rent types who wear a day coat, pants with stripes and cutaway coat, perfect fits.........................
Are you busy?
Would you like a sandwich?
Inga, wake up!
Whatever it is, it's coming from down there.  I'm going down to see.
Well, this explains the music.
Raise the platform, hurry!
Oh, Doctor!
All right -- give it to him!
Good night, Doctor.
I say, it wouldn't be fair to you... or to me.
No.  Nor to Elizabeth.
Why don't we talk inside?
Are you ready for me?
His what??
Four
Oh, must be around ten... ten-thirty.
Food!
What o'clock is it, Mr Noggs?
Eleven o'clock, My LorJ 42
Splendid horsemanship  Who are they?
How quickly can you move your artillery forward?
Well, fed or hungry, Pulleine wants them in position immediately. .
